00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
a pretty good draw last game and

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.069 
a pretty good draw last game and
whatever<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.980> even<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> talk<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.489> asking

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
whatever not even to talk about asking

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
whatever not even to talk about asking
let's<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.230> even<00:00:46.440> talk<00:00:46.739> about<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.719> normally<00:00:48.719> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
let's not even talk about it normally I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.420 
let's not even talk about it normally I
would<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.050> bolt<00:00:49.230> him<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> face<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
would just bolt him in the face here but

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
would just bolt him in the face here but
I<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> winning<00:00:51.539> strategy

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I don't think that's a winning strategy

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
I don't think that's a winning strategy
because<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.559> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
because I kind of want to just get to my

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040 
because I kind of want to just get to my
inferno<00:00:54.059> titan<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.629> feel<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.899> i'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
inferno titan and then i feel like i'll

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
inferno titan and then i feel like i'll
be<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> best<00:00:55.440> position<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.280> can

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
be in the best position that i can

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080 
be in the best position that i can
possibly<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> win<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.640> gonna

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
possibly have to win so I'm just gonna

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
possibly have to win so I'm just gonna
hold<00:01:00.449> off<00:01:00.629> till<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.260> hopefully<00:01:02.250> he<00:01:02.550> doesn't

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
hold off till then hopefully he doesn't

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
hold off till then hopefully he doesn't
have<00:01:03.090> another<00:01:03.270> leatherback<00:01:03.719> baloth

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
have another leatherback baloth

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
have another leatherback baloth
hopefully<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:05.040> play<00:01:05.220> something<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
hopefully can he play something that I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
hopefully can he play something that I
can<00:01:05.790> kill<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.060> flame<00:01:06.270> /<00:01:06.450> that'd<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.049> pretty

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can kill with flame / that'd be pretty

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
can kill with flame / that'd be pretty
sweet<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:11.150> there's<00:01:12.150> flames<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
sweet I think and there's flames of the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.539 
sweet I think and there's flames of the
fire<00:01:12.750> brand<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:14.340> much

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
fire brand which is pretty pretty much

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
fire brand which is pretty pretty much
useless<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> hit<00:01:15.750> him<00:01:15.840> up

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
useless so I'm just going to hit him up

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.780 
useless so I'm just going to hit him up
for<00:01:15.990> three<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:19.009> passed<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> turn<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> just

doesn't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.340> primal<00:01:51.090> bellow<00:01:53.030> searing

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
doesn't have a primal bellow searing

blaze<00:01:54.210> Oh<00:01:54.720> wrong<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.430> hoping<00:01:56.640> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
blaze Oh wrong one I was hoping for

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
blaze Oh wrong one I was hoping for
searing<00:01:57.060> blaze<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.540> alright<00:01:57.719> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
searing blaze right there alright so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.639 
searing blaze right there alright so
let's<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.200> some<00:01:58.909> mathematics<00:01:59.909> uh<00:02:00.409> hit<00:02:01.409> him<00:02:01.530> up

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
let's do some mathematics uh hit him up

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
let's do some mathematics uh hit him up
for<00:02:02.540> 6<00:02:03.540> 11<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.430> not<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> cut

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
for 6 11 yeah so that's not going to cut

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.510 
for 6 11 yeah so that's not going to cut
it<00:02:06.180> i<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:07.910> question<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.270> kill

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
it i don't think question is do I kill

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.830 
it i don't think question is do I kill
do<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.580> kill<00:02:11.640> other<00:02:12.000> back<00:02:12.180> bail<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.510> by<00:02:12.690> using

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
do I kill other back bail off by using

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
do I kill other back bail off by using
to<00:02:13.080> remove

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to remove

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
to remove
spells<00:02:13.830> or<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.430> hold<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:15.030> i<00:02:15.060> think<00:02:15.300> i<00:02:15.360> do

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
spells or do I just hold on i think i do

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
spells or do I just hold on i think i do
because<00:02:15.750> once<00:02:16.080> i<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.500> inferno<00:02:16.920> titan<00:02:17.129> then

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because once i get to inferno titan then

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.229 
because once i get to inferno titan then
hopefully<00:02:18.239> that'll<00:02:18.420> provide<00:02:18.750> me<00:02:18.989> with<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
hopefully that'll provide me with the

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.360 
hopefully that'll provide me with the
stuff<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.390> i<00:02:21.420> need<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.629> win<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.050> game<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.500> if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
stuff that i need to win the game and if

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.150 
stuff that i need to win the game and if
he<00:02:23.459> has<00:02:23.580> pompier<00:02:24.360> that's<00:02:24.599> bad<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.470> me<00:02:25.500> but

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
he has pompier that's bad for me but

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.390 
he has pompier that's bad for me but
it's<00:02:26.220> not<00:02:26.519> like<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.970> end<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.300> world<00:02:27.480> if

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it's not like the end of the world if

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.890 
it's not like the end of the world if
that<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.519> searing<00:02:29.879> blaze<00:02:30.000> though<00:02:30.360> then<00:02:30.840> i

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that was searing blaze though then i

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.000 
that was searing blaze though then i
would<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.140> been<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.680> pretty<00:02:31.830> good

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
would have been actually pretty good

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.470 
would have been actually pretty good
shape<00:02:32.190> or<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.940> lot<00:02:33.090> better<00:02:33.269> shape

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
shape or like in a lot better shape

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.369 
shape or like in a lot better shape
because<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.080> he'd<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.349> at<00:02:34.440> 14<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.810> i<00:02:36.810> would

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
because then he'd be at 14 and i would

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.990 
because then he'd be at 14 and i would
basically<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:38.160> searing<00:02:38.549> blaze<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.970> just

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
basically because searing blaze I just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.070 
basically because searing blaze I just
want<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.360> get<00:02:39.450> out<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.750> way<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> don't

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
want to get out of the way I don't

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.600 
want to get out of the way I don't
really<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.530> cast<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.950> doesn't<00:02:41.310> matter<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
really want to cast it doesn't matter to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.100 
really want to cast it doesn't matter to
me<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:44.330> don't<00:02:45.330> know<00:02:46.250> whatever<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:48.150> just

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
me and I don't know whatever I like just

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.229 
me and I don't know whatever I like just
getting<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> free<00:02:49.860> 3<00:02:50.069> damage<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:50.730> good

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
getting the free 3 damage just is good

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.930 
getting the free 3 damage just is good
and<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.260> had<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.590> use<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.829> flame<00:02:53.040> /<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
and so I had to use a flame / in that to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940 
and so I had to use a flame / in that to
kill<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.269> as<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.079> as<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.500> stands<00:02:55.709> flame

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
kill it but as it is as it stands flame

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.979 
kill it but as it is as it stands flame
/<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.280> searing<00:02:56.519> spear<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.910> having<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.870> use

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
/ in searing spear but having to use

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.710 
/ in searing spear but having to use
both<00:02:58.140> them<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.590> puts<00:02:59.430> me<00:02:59.549> way<00:02:59.910> behind<00:03:00.209> so

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
both them on that puts me way behind so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
both them on that puts me way behind so
hopefully<00:03:00.959> I'll<00:03:01.170> draw<00:03:01.349> a<00:03:01.379> flame<00:03:01.680> break<00:03:01.920> here

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
hopefully I'll draw a flame break here

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.059 
hopefully I'll draw a flame break here
or<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.849> or<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> land<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.720> land<00:03:04.290> would<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.590> pretty

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
or that or a land a land would be pretty

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.140 
or that or a land a land would be pretty
clutch<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.879> could<00:03:06.720> really<00:03:06.870> use<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.200> here<00:03:08.150> yay

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
clutch I could really use one here yay

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.330 
clutch I could really use one here yay
it<00:03:10.049> looks<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.290> he<00:03:10.560> actually<00:03:10.709> missed<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.160> land

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it looks like he actually missed a land

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.259 
it looks like he actually missed a land
dropped<00:03:11.549> too<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.629> that's<00:03:12.750> pretty<00:03:13.019> good<00:03:13.260> news

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
dropped too so that's pretty good news

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.430 
dropped too so that's pretty good news
unless<00:03:15.269> he's<00:03:15.420> got<00:03:15.599> another<00:03:15.900> Blanche<00:03:16.230> wood

swing<00:03:39.389> him<00:03:39.480> for<00:03:39.630> three<00:03:39.780> which<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:39.930> fine<00:03:40.230> like

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
swing him for three which is fine like

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.750 
swing him for three which is fine like
the<00:03:40.650> three<00:03:40.859> damage<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.489> care<00:03:41.670> about

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the three damage don't really care about

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.460 
the three damage don't really care about
it's<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.720> Blanchard<00:03:43.109> armor<00:03:43.349> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
it's the the Blanchard armor that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.500 
it's the the Blanchard armor that
that'll<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.370> me<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.639> hexproof<00:03:44.970> Blanchard

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
that'll get me that hexproof Blanchard

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.259 
that'll get me that hexproof Blanchard
armor<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> pretty<00:03:46.349> rough<00:03:46.849> okay<00:03:47.849> he's<00:03:48.030> got<00:03:48.239> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
armor is pretty rough okay he's got a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.690 
armor is pretty rough okay he's got a
lightning<00:03:48.870> greaves<00:03:49.079> here<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.250> again<00:03:50.370> he

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
lightning greaves here but again he

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.759 
lightning greaves here but again he
missed<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.940> land<00:03:51.180> drop<00:03:51.419> so<00:03:51.750> not<00:03:52.319> looking<00:03:52.470> too

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
missed the land drop so not looking too

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.129 
missed the land drop so not looking too
good<00:03:52.799> for<00:03:53.160> me<00:03:53.340> for<00:03:53.639> him<00:03:53.840> yeah<00:03:54.840> there's<00:03:55.049> no

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
good for me for him yeah there's no

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.809 
good for me for him yeah there's no
point<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.440> equipping<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.040> there<00:03:56.450> because<00:03:58.819> it's

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
point in equipping it there because it's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.210 
point in equipping it there because it's
got<00:03:59.970> hexproof<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.530> don't<00:04:01.889> want<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.099> give<00:04:02.190> a

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
got hexproof so you don't want to give a

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.710 
got hexproof so you don't want to give a
trout<00:04:02.489> if<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.730> already<00:04:02.880> has<00:04:03.030> hexproof<00:04:03.450> that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
trout if it already has hexproof that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.280 
trout if it already has hexproof that
doesn't<00:04:03.989> really<00:04:04.079> help<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.440> at<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.750> there

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
doesn't really help you at all the there

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.500 
doesn't really help you at all the there
is<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.739> convoluted<00:04:08.430> way<00:04:08.579> where<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.090> actually

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
is a convoluted way where that actually

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.569 
is a convoluted way where that actually
could<00:04:09.630> help<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.200> not<00:04:10.680> even<00:04:10.980> explain<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.310> since

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
could help but not even explain it since

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.870 
could help but not even explain it since
it's<00:04:11.700> not<00:04:11.849> worth<00:04:12.060> either<00:04:12.329> of<00:04:12.510> our<00:04:12.630> times<00:04:13.880> but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
it's not worth either of our times but

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
it's not worth either of our times but
I'm<00:04:15.090> going<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.419> hit<00:04:15.720> him<00:04:15.989> in<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.169> face<00:04:16.260> for

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
I'm going to hit him in the face for

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.779 
I'm going to hit him in the face for
three<00:04:17.039> with<00:04:17.450> my<00:04:18.450> inferno<00:04:19.139> titan<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.919> then

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
three with my inferno titan and then

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.480 
three with my inferno titan and then
next<00:04:21.450> turn<00:04:21.690> he<00:04:22.019> unless<00:04:22.830> he<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.010> mean<00:04:23.250> he<00:04:23.370> might

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
next turn he unless he I mean he might

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.219 
next turn he unless he I mean he might
have<00:04:23.640> another<00:04:23.760> creature<00:04:24.090> which<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.330> fine<00:04:24.659> but

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
have another creature which is fine but

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.980 
have another creature which is fine but
I<00:04:25.289> do<00:04:25.469> have<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.740> lightning<00:04:26.130> bolt<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.400> hand<00:04:26.580> so

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
I do have this lightning bolt in hand so

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.180 
I do have this lightning bolt in hand so
even<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.080> he<00:04:28.170> chump<00:04:28.410> blocks<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.860> still<00:04:29.070> win

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
even if he chump blocks and I still win

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.880 
even if he chump blocks and I still win
the<00:04:29.250> game<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.520> next<00:04:29.610> turn<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:31.380> long<00:04:31.590> as<00:04:31.740> he

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
the game the next turn so long as he

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.830 
the game the next turn so long as he
doesn't<00:04:32.070> jump<00:04:32.760> block<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.090> kill<00:04:33.300> or<00:04:33.600> something

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
doesn't jump block and kill or something

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.720 
doesn't jump block and kill or something
like<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.020> but<00:04:34.340> there<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> good<00:04:35.670> chance

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
like that but there is a good chance

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.220 
like that but there is a good chance
that<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:36.270> win<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.450> game<00:04:36.630> outright<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.110> I

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
that I just win the game outright if I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.590 
that I just win the game outright if I
draw<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.470> searing<00:04:37.800> spear<00:04:37.920> or<00:04:38.400> pretty<00:04:39.060> much<00:04:39.150> any

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
draw a searing spear or pretty much any

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.770 
draw a searing spear or pretty much any
spell<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.620> my<00:04:40.650> deck<00:04:40.950> actually<00:04:41.510> we'll<00:04:42.510> just<00:04:42.660> do

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
spell in my deck actually we'll just do

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.360 
spell in my deck actually we'll just do
it<00:04:42.810> other<00:04:43.080> than<00:04:43.290> like<00:04:43.500> another<00:04:43.800> inferno<00:04:44.190> titan

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
it other than like another inferno titan

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
it other than like another inferno titan
which<00:04:44.640> case<00:04:44.790> i'll<00:04:44.910> have<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.120> wait<00:04:45.240> another

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
which case i'll have to wait another

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.610 
which case i'll have to wait another
turn<00:04:45.600> because<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.990> only<00:04:46.020> 6<00:04:46.380> mana<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:48.620> anyway

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620

turn because that only 6 mana but anyway
this<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.250> pretty<00:04:50.430> much<00:04:50.490> exactly

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
this is this is pretty much exactly

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
that first game that was rough i

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.860 
that first game that was rough i
actually<00:04:59.940> could<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.240> won<00:05:00.390> that<00:05:00.420> game<00:05:00.690> which

actually could have won that game which

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.060 
actually could have won that game which
was<00:05:00.990> which<00:05:01.230> was<00:05:01.260> pretty<00:05:01.500> interesting<00:05:01.800> because

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
was which was pretty interesting because

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.260 
was which was pretty interesting because
i<00:05:02.250> really<00:05:02.520> did<00:05:02.640> not<00:05:02.730> think<00:05:02.790> I<00:05:03.000> was<00:05:03.060> going<00:05:03.180> to

win when he put Blanchard arm around a
hexproof<00:05:04.710> dude<00:05:05.040> but<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.420> fact<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.780> still

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
hexproof dude but the fact that I still

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.060 
hexproof dude but the fact that I still
had<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.170> chance<00:05:07.380> of<00:05:07.530> winning<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.770> game<00:05:07.830> was

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
had a chance of winning that game was

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.630 
had a chance of winning that game was
pretty<00:05:08.190> sweet<00:05:08.600> um<00:05:09.950> anyway<00:05:10.950> it's<00:05:11.250> unfortunate

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
pretty sweet um anyway it's unfortunate

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.490 
pretty sweet um anyway it's unfortunate
that<00:05:11.670> he<00:05:11.790> got<00:05:11.910> Lance<00:05:12.120> crude<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:12.750> at

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
that he got Lance crude here but at

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.660 
that he got Lance crude here but at
least<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.740> didn't<00:05:13.920> get<00:05:13.980> clock<00:05:14.220> screwed<00:05:14.520> right

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
least you didn't get clock screwed right

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.580 
least you didn't get clock screwed right
oh<00:05:15.060> god<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.540> can't<00:05:15.870> believe<00:05:15.960> I<00:05:16.170> was<00:05:16.290> not<00:05:16.440> paying

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
oh god I can't believe I was not paying

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.340 
oh god I can't believe I was not paying
attention<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.780> but<00:05:18.780> at<00:05:19.020> least<00:05:19.140> I'll<00:05:19.320> be

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
attention to that but at least I'll be

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.720 
attention to that but at least I'll be
more<00:05:19.620> cautious<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.160> future<00:05:20.220> if<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.610> ever

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
more cautious in the future if I ever

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.090 
more cautious in the future if I ever
have<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:20.970> think<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.600> lot<00:05:21.720> there's<00:05:22.680> no<00:05:22.860> way<00:05:23.010> I'm

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
have to think a lot there's no way I'm

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.640 
have to think a lot there's no way I'm
blocking<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.610> like<00:05:24.180> primal<00:05:24.900> bill<00:05:25.140> does<00:05:25.440> I

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
blocking this like primal bill does I

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.500 
blocking this like primal bill does I
die<00:05:26.250> show<00:05:26.400> does<00:05:26.580> not<00:05:26.610> care<00:05:26.970> about<00:05:27.090> primal

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
die show does not care about primal

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.480 
die show does not care about primal
bellow<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:30.350> yeah<00:05:31.350> primal<00:05:31.710> bellow<00:05:31.890> do<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.340> do

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
bellow and yeah primal bellow do it do

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.940 
bellow and yeah primal bellow do it do
it<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.760> do<00:05:33.030> it<00:05:33.060> I<00:05:33.300> don't<00:05:33.540> care<00:05:33.800> makes<00:05:34.800> no

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
it do it do it I don't care makes no

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.870 
it do it do it I don't care makes no
difference<00:05:35.310> to<00:05:35.370> me<00:05:37.130> like<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.340> were<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.700> only

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
difference to me like they were the only

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.810 
difference to me like they were the only
way<00:05:39.120> like<00:05:40.070> primal<00:05:41.070> bellowing<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.610> mean

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
way like primal bellowing I mean

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.270 
way like primal bellowing I mean
attacking<00:05:42.270> there<00:05:42.390> is<00:05:42.540> kind<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.930> weak<00:05:43.080> cuz<00:05:43.830> I

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
attacking there is kind of weak cuz I

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.800 
attacking there is kind of weak cuz I
mean<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:44.730> you<00:05:44.820> really<00:05:44.850> don't<00:05:45.300> think<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.660> I

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
mean if you really don't think that I

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.270 
mean if you really don't think that I
have<00:05:46.910> like<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.600> I<00:05:48.630> have<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.900> kill<00:05:49.110> then<00:05:49.470> well

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
have like that I have the kill then well

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.120 
have like that I have the kill then well
it's<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.730> game<00:05:51.090> anyway<00:05:51.500> if<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:52.650> really<00:05:52.830> if

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
it's just game anyway if you really if

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.260 
it's just game anyway if you really if
you<00:05:53.220> really<00:05:53.460> think<00:05:53.700> i'm<00:05:53.880> going<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.030> be<00:05:54.150> that

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
you really think i'm going to be that

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.790 
you really think i'm going to be that
bad<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.630> block<00:05:54.810> there<00:05:55.050> then<00:05:55.260> it's<00:05:55.440> just<00:05:55.590> like

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
bad and block there then it's just like

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.470 
bad and block there then it's just like
whatever<00:05:56.130> but<00:05:56.580> i<00:05:56.730> think<00:05:57.090> it<00:05:57.210> would<00:05:57.300> have<00:05:57.390> been

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
whatever but i think it would have been

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.760 
whatever but i think it would have been
smarter<00:05:57.840> for<00:05:57.870> him<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.110> hold<00:05:58.260> back<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:58.680> then

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
smarter for him to hold back and then

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.220 
smarter for him to hold back and then
block<00:05:59.340> in<00:05:59.490> primal<00:05:59.850> bellow<00:06:00.020> because<00:06:01.020> then<00:06:01.140> he

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
block in primal bellow because then he

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.060 
block in primal bellow because then he
would<00:06:01.290> have<00:06:01.410> been<00:06:01.500> able<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.740> survive<00:06:01.890> another

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
would have been able to survive another

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.420 
would have been able to survive another
turn<00:06:02.390> he's<00:06:03.390> got<00:06:03.600> another<00:06:03.810> primal<00:06:04.290> bell<00:06:04.430> that's

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
turn he's got another primal bell that's

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.300 
turn he's got another primal bell that's
funny<00:06:05.840> um<00:06:06.840> so<00:06:07.350> yeah<00:06:07.680> I<00:06:07.860> guess<00:06:07.980> that<00:06:08.190> was<00:06:08.250> a

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
funny um so yeah I guess that was a

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.890 
funny um so yeah I guess that was a
pretty<00:06:08.460> sweet<00:06:08.730> hand<00:06:08.970> for<00:06:09.150> him<00:06:09.240> double<00:06:09.720> prime

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
pretty sweet hand for him double prime

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.230 
pretty sweet hand for him double prime
abello<00:06:10.200> and<00:06:10.500> a<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:13.830> primal<00:06:14.700> hunt<00:06:14.820> beast<00:06:15.030> but

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
abello and a and a primal hunt beast but

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.680 
abello and a and a primal hunt beast but
anyway<00:06:15.630> that's<00:06:15.840> gonna<00:06:16.380> be<00:06:16.590> game<00:06:16.830> 2<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.460> now

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
anyway that's gonna be game 2 and now

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.600 
anyway that's gonna be game 2 and now
we're<00:06:18.690> 11<00:06:19.080> so<00:06:19.410> hopefully<00:06:20.130> this<00:06:20.250> will<00:06:20.370> go<00:06:20.580> a

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
we're 11 so hopefully this will go a

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.040 
we're 11 so hopefully this will go a
little<00:06:20.970> bit<00:06:21.180> better<00:06:21.330> from<00:06:21.780> here<00:06:21.810> on<00:06:22.290> out<00:06:22.620> and

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
little bit better from here on out and

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.390 
little bit better from here on out and
yeah<00:06:25.050> anyway<00:06:25.590> hope<00:06:25.740> you<00:06:25.830> guys<00:06:25.980> enjoyed<00:06:26.220> that

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
yeah anyway hope you guys enjoyed that

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.510 
yeah anyway hope you guys enjoyed that
one<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.880> have<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.090> nice<00:06:27.210> tank<00:06:27.390> by
