was focused tonight he wasn't smiling as
much<00:05:02.629> earlier<00:05:03.050> on<00:05:03.199> he<00:05:03.349> wasn't<00:05:03.680> good<00:05:03.830> carrying

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789

on<00:05:04.939> in<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.360> way<00:05:05.810> which<00:05:06.020> he<00:05:06.169> can<00:05:06.439> do<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.919> this

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
on in the way which he can do and this

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.540 
on in the way which he can do and this
was<00:05:08.050> an<00:05:09.050> effort<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.590> real<00:05:09.770> effort<00:05:09.979> but<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.400> was<00:05:10.520> a

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
was an effort a real effort but it was a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.369 
was an effort a real effort but it was a
great<00:05:10.849> effort<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.419> he's<00:05:11.870> looking<00:05:12.020> for<00:05:12.229> the

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
great effort and he's looking for the

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.379 
great effort and he's looking for the
time<00:05:12.710> he<00:05:12.740> wants<00:05:13.219> the<00:05:13.340> confidence<00:05:13.849> booster<00:05:14.270> he

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
time he wants the confidence booster he

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.600 
time he wants the confidence booster he
wants<00:05:14.689> to<00:05:14.810> know<00:05:14.990> for<00:05:15.289> himself<00:05:15.800> as<00:05:16.310> much<00:05:16.460> as

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610
