00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:10.590
 hey here is channel for giger and it will 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.840
 time for something big like her again 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 we have the samsung galaxy here 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.920
 note 2 that finally arrived at ours 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.740
 office dangled the first time we have 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 That's almost two months ago at the event 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.369
 seen by samsung here in berlin 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 Now we finally have ours 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 own test device get that too 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.400
 it was already unpacked as it was 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.080
 looks like the packaging is such a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.329
 bit damaged but that's the way it is 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 with test equipment I have now in the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.750
 next time a bit the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.160
 possibilities like the part really one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.960
 to have a closer look I have 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 I'm already in the first video 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 little bit disputed 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 now it's almost coming in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 long-term tests first, but I want 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.210
 I like to unpack that part 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 I have not opened myself yet 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.899
 So lied because I've already 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 but not unwillingly unpacked 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.410
 and then we'll have a look again 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 together but what in this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.879
 hiding then I come then 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.949
 directly to a short dealer of the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 design so the surface and so on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.950
 first impression you visually of the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.799
 device does and then there is a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.680
 part 2 and part three of the video to touch 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.090
 2 where I am a little bit too 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.549
 to deal with the hardware 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.150
 and then so to the operability 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.009
 operability of the smartphone or tablet 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.409
 As you like to say but we come 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.330
 first to unpack so the pack 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.189
 is already quite big but it is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.829
 is not a miracle because that gets that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.860
 in there is also really in whole 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.570
 beautiful gisela here with a beautiful 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.360
 plastic film for protection the first time 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.460
 wrong points on but that's good 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 So that's what we have here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.320
 inside, what about one? 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.950
 quick guide to the device bit 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.290
 advertising to other devices from samsung 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.320
 an important note a few notes 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.149
 here the short instructions in German 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.340
 and in English with it you are the same 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.890
 can get started 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.740
 Furthermore, here is the inside 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.170
 power supply you should also the camera 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.310
 Hold on to see that here with you 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.140
 USB cable to 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.940
 yes, where is the sharp no sharp 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.740
 in sight, well in any case 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.120
 here comes a usb cable purely to the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.850
 device to charge 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 then we have just this 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.900
 currently described usb cable for 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.270
 the power supply provides further 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.150
 a few headphones 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.070
 they are also like samsung's 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.680
 the accustomed is now with a 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.330
 small remote control equipped where 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.290
 you can skip and the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.060
 change the volume and double-click 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.840
 most likely the song will stop 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.500
 or 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.410
 can turn on and then we have here 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.570
 yes still sunday on higher essays for 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.260
 people a little smaller or bigger 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.980
 have ears 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.640
 and last but not least the battery without 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.200
 The battery is not 3100 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.350
 But mah strong must also be 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.780
 people klotz so far so to the things 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.320
 Here in the packaging 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.380
 there is nothing hidden here 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:32.760
 which was then s quasi therefore sufficient 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:38.360
 Let's take a look next 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.360
