I'm<00:00:47.219> gonna<00:00:47.579> try<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.390> top<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.739> free<00:00:50.160> G

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
I'm gonna try and top up my free G

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm gonna try and top up my free G
dongle<00:00:51.120> thing<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.719> run<00:00:51.899> out<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
dongle thing because I've run out of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
dongle thing because I've run out of
that<00:00:52.320> pretty<00:00:52.649> quickly<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> mentioned

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that pretty quickly as I mentioned

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
that pretty quickly as I mentioned
before<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> yeah<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.469> definitely<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
before so yeah we definitely need to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
before so yeah we definitely need to
chop<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
chop that up right now let's see if I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.930 
chop that up right now let's see if I
can<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.250> sure<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.820> work

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
can do it I'm not sure if it will work

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
can do it I'm not sure if it will work
and<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> reason<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.440> doing<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.100> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and the reason I'm doing this is because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
and the reason I'm doing this is because
Diamond<00:01:03.239> dimensions<00:01:03.600> still<00:01:03.750> needs<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> up

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
Diamond dimensions still needs to go up

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
Diamond dimensions still needs to go up
and<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> upload<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.670> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and I try to upload it and it would have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.219 
and I try to upload it and it would have
taken<00:01:07.070> 250<00:01:08.070> minutes<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
taken 250 minutes which is just over a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
taken 250 minutes which is just over a
grand<00:01:10.920> total<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.520> four<00:01:11.850> hours<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.659> I'd<00:01:12.810> done<00:01:12.930> my

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
grand total of four hours if I'd done my

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.770 
grand total of four hours if I'd done my
maths<00:01:13.350> correctly<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.630> ridiculous<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
maths correctly that is ridiculous it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.770 
maths correctly that is ridiculous it
wouldn't<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.470> until<00:01:17.450> 11<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.630> guess

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
wouldn't have been up until 11 I guess

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.850 
wouldn't have been up until 11 I guess
it's<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.200> bad<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.680> needs<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it's not too bad but it needs to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.330 
it's not too bad but it needs to
processed<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.700> well<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.799> else<00:01:22.979> fails

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
processed as well so if all else fails

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.969 
processed as well so if all else fails
I'm<00:01:23.970> gonna<00:01:24.240> drain<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> 3G<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> need<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I'm gonna drain this 3G and I need the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
I'm gonna drain this 3G and I need the
3d<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> work<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> insomnia

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
3d to work for when I go to insomnia

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.420 
3d to work for when I go to insomnia
because<00:01:28.530> otherwise<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.220> able<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
because otherwise I'm not be able to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
because otherwise I'm not be able to
upload<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:29.939> vlogs<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.540> those<00:01:30.720> webs<00:01:31.020> are

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
upload these vlogs and those webs are

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
upload these vlogs and those webs are
hopefully<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> super<00:01:32.310> cool<00:01:32.460> out

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
hopefully going to be a super cool out

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.080 
hopefully going to be a super cool out
