00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.160
 when you need photoshop where you go 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.190
 to download well let's be honest 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 you almost always go for some 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 torrents his riza site is still not clear what 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.800
 from where download very doubtful 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.460
 quality any packages that are on 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.760
 really 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 slightly even dumb install kids 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.800
 who got shoved there 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 actually with the help of such you hold 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 packages and create for example thieves 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.110
 when a botnet is a bunch of infected 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.270
 computers performing other people's actions 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 so in this particular case, not all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.789
 know that you can take it to download 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 elementary photoshop from the site 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.899

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.520

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.990

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 photoshop minus of course there will be 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 demo version that will work first 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.970
 30 days 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 if you really want you can grunt 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.909
 demos and drive in there some code 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.880

 access but this is your business 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.049
 and I just say as much as possible without 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.600
 no torrents without nothing 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.799
