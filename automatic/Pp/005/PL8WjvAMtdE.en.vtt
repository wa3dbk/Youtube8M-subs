a<00:02:02.920> couple<00:02:03.340> different<00:02:03.460> angles<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.700> got<00:02:07.510> a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
a couple different angles so got a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.389 
a couple different angles so got a

love this giant piece of Rockford I mean

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.520 
love this giant piece of Rockford I mean
this<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:19.970> when<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.870> done<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.260> going<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.440> be

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
this is when it's done it's going to be

this is when it's done it's going to be
one<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.280> more<00:02:22.430> spectacular<00:02:22.640> things<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
one of the more spectacular things I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.780 
one of the more spectacular things I
think<00:02:23.300> you'll<00:02:23.510> see<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.320> part<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.950> think<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
think you'll see in this part I think it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.570 
think you'll see in this part I think it
should<00:02:25.940> rank<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.240> there<00:02:26.270> were<00:02:26.450> upwards<00:02:27.580> third

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
should rank up there were upwards third

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
should rank up there were upwards third

years<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:25.110> saw<00:03:25.260> some<00:03:25.380> markers<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:25.950> there

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
years and we saw some markers in there

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.390 
years and we saw some markers in there
in<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> last<00:03:26.459> video<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:26.850> now<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.780> a

some real construction wall for a real
lock<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.570> looks<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:33.780> something

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
lock on it so it looks like something

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.410 
lock on it so it looks like something
might<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.740> down<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.310> rumors<00:03:36.270> have
