00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
back on aab studi i'll see if laura can

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.470 
back on aab studi i'll see if laura can
get<00:00:35.190> another<00:00:35.399> base<00:00:35.610> maybe<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.090> upper<00:00:36.329> lot<00:00:36.450> i

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
get another base maybe that upper lot i

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.729 
get another base maybe that upper lot i
think<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:36.930> put<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.440> basis

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
think you should just put out some basis

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
think you should just put out some basis
right<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> 12th<00:00:38.579> clock<00:00:38.790> go<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
right now go to the 12th clock go to the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
right now go to the 12th clock go to the
upper<00:00:39.540> left<00:00:39.780> hand<00:00:39.840> thing<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:40.980> some

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
upper left hand thing just put some

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
upper left hand thing just put some
bases<00:00:41.399> down<00:00:41.579> otherwise<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.120> some<00:00:42.300> lurkers<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
bases down otherwise get some lurkers on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
bases down otherwise get some lurkers on
your<00:00:43.500> front<00:00:43.649> door<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.219> zerglings<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.730> not

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
your front door the zerglings are not

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
your front door the zerglings are not
going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.120> able<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.360> stop<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.870> base<00:00:46.289> from

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going to be able to stop that base from

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.660 
going to be able to stop that base from
going<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.890> upper<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.219> he<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.399> getting

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
going out that upper right he is getting

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
going out that upper right he is getting
that<00:00:47.879> upper<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.200> he<00:00:49.289> still

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that upper right but I think he still

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
that upper right but I think he still
needs<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> distraction<00:00:49.980> hatchery<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.940> 12

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
needs a distraction hatchery at that 12

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
needs a distraction hatchery at that 12
or<00:00:51.539> maybe<00:00:52.079> even<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.410> drop<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.920> don't<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
or maybe even a drop I don't know how to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.680 
or maybe even a drop I don't know how to
take<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> island<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.149> something<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
take the island or something like that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
take the island or something like that
he<00:00:54.960> needs<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.370> hatcheries<00:00:56.730> up

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
he needs to get two more hatcheries up

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
he needs to get two more hatcheries up
at<00:00:57.149> least<00:00:57.840> leave<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.770> maybe<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.340> sacrifice

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
at least leave one maybe two sacrifice

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
at least leave one maybe two sacrifice
that<00:01:00.750> allowing<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.829> least<00:01:02.010> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that allowing the other to at least get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
that allowing the other to at least get
established<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:03.329> David<00:01:03.629> Kim<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
continuing to roll on out he still got

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
continuing to roll on out he still got
three<00:01:05.729> basis<00:01:06.180> versus<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.840> guess<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> four
