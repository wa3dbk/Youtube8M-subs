00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.120
 hello you tube people here I bring you a new updated top of the best 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.710
 ps3 games according to my point of view 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.669
 I make this video since I have played new games 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:10.960
 well let's get started 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.419
 in position number ten you will find batman arkham asylum 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.759
 since it has very good graphics 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.009
 many varieties of combos and in the battles against your enemies badman does 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.659
 some super combos 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.039
 its gameplay is good to kill all guards stealthily 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.689
 I put this game in this place because it is difficult to find where to go and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.760
 find all the riddles it makes you very complicated 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.830
 in the position number nine is well they are since it is a very good game is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 a first-person shooter based on a city submerged in the sea 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 alive and all you have electric powers and various types of weapons 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.570
 I put it in this place since the game sometimes I find it hard to find where to go 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.050
 and that bores me 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 in position number eight is metal gear solid 4 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.650
 since it is an excellent game 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.780
 with great graphics 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.810
 its online also I think it's good and with a great story 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.610

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.610

 It is a shooter game with some graphics that you share with just seeing it has a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.150
 very good online mode of up to 32 players that I think 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 its very broad history and the best of the best of this game are its graphics 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.110
 in position number six you will find infamous 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.410

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.220
 with very good graphics 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.640
 the story totally changes the game if he decides to be an infamous or if he decides to be 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.960
