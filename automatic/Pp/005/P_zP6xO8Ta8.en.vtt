originally<00:00:45.929> went<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> wiki<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> find<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
originally went to the wiki to find it

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.970 
originally went to the wiki to find it
and<00:00:47.960> they<00:00:48.960> were<00:00:49.019> saying<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.499> was<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.739> shallow

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and they were saying that was in shallow

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.099 
and they were saying that was in shallow
water<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.579> then<00:00:50.760> after<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.089> I<00:00:51.300> had<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> search

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
water so then after I I had to search

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.840 
water so then after I I had to search
the<00:00:52.289> wiki<00:00:52.589> i<00:00:52.620> went<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:52.949> youtube<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.489> started

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
looking around there and found a few

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
looking around there and found a few
videos<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.059> they<00:00:57.120> were<00:00:57.179> you<00:00:57.480> know

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
videos in there and they were you know

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
videos in there and they were you know
they<00:00:58.469> were<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.679> telling<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.429> have<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
they were just telling you you have to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
they were just telling you you have to
use<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.030> map<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.989> use<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.289> map

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
use this map so you have to use this map

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
use this map so you have to use this map
seed<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.159> mean<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.909> you<00:01:02.999> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.390> yeah<00:01:03.629> go

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
seed and I mean if you want to yeah go

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
seed and I mean if you want to yeah go
ahead<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.620> suggest<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
ahead but I suggest don't give up on

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
ahead but I suggest don't give up on
your<00:01:06.330> map<00:01:06.800> now<00:01:07.800> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.159> something<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
your map now if you got something that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.760 
your map now if you got something that
you're<00:01:08.790> working<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.050> can't<00:01:10.290> find<00:01:10.470> clay

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you're working on if you can't find clay

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
you're working on if you can't find clay
in<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.280> we'll<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.460> work<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
in it well we'll just work around it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
in it well we'll just work around it
because<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
because you know you put all the time

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
because you know you put all the time
and<00:01:15.120> there<00:01:15.240> there's<00:01:15.390> no<00:01:15.510> sense<00:01:15.750> giving<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.440> up

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and there there's no sense giving it up

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
and there there's no sense giving it up
just<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.800> you<00:01:16.950> can't<00:01:17.160> find<00:01:17.430> clay<00:01:17.640> but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
just because you can't find clay but

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
just because you can't find clay but
chances<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.230> though<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.820> map

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
chances are though is it is on your map

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.900 
chances are though is it is on your map
so<00:01:21.720> within<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.530> may<00:01:22.680> find<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> I'm<00:01:23.310> not

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
so within time you may find it I'm not

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.100 
so within time you may find it I'm not
saying<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.300> it<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.690> there<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> hundred

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
saying that it is there a hundred

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
saying that it is there a hundred
percent<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.800> chances<00:01:26.190> are<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.730> is<00:01:26.940> there

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
percent but chances are that it is there

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.530 
percent but chances are that it is there
um<00:01:28.370> there's<00:01:29.370> going<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.940> map<00:01:30.300> seed

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
um there's going to be some map seed

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.150 
um there's going to be some map seed

go searching they all that way that way

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
go searching they all that way that way
you<00:01:42.870> can<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.800> just<00:01:44.070> enter<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.370> map

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you can just you just enter in a map

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.040 
you can just you just enter in a map
seed<00:01:44.760> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.910> know<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.960> know

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
seed and you know it's there you know

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.510 
seed and you know it's there you know
and<00:01:46.080> pretty<00:01:46.410> much<00:01:46.470> no<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> video<00:01:47.040> showing
