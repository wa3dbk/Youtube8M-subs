we're going to start off with my
signature<00:00:25.199> beds<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.310> and

signature beds that I like to do and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.070 
signature beds that I like to do and
we'll<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> slap<00:00:27.720> bang<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> middle<00:00:28.199> so

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
we'll do it slap bang in the middle so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.180 
we'll do it slap bang in the middle so
make<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.109> five<00:00:31.619> wide<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.649> seven<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
make it five wide and seven for the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.319 
make it five wide and seven for the
sides<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> bring<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.739> down<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.120> large

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
sides you bring this down that's a large

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
sides you bring this down that's a large
beds<00:00:40.399> but<00:00:41.399> it'll<00:00:41.579> work<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.980> way<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
beds but it'll work so the way I do this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
beds but it'll work so the way I do this
is<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.730> literally<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.440> make<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> headboard<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
is I literally just make a headboard and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
is I literally just make a headboard and
then<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> step<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> bed<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
then I have a step up to the bed so that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
then I have a step up to the bed so that
you<00:00:50.100> wouldn't<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> jump<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.989> bed

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you wouldn't have to jump into the bed

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
you wouldn't have to jump into the bed
that's<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.480> makes<00:00:54.629> no<00:00:54.840> difference

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that's I know it makes no difference

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
that's I know it makes no difference
especially<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.309> creative<00:00:56.789> mode<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:59.090> am<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
especially in creative mode but I am a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
especially in creative mode but I am a
sucker<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:01.079> details<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.710> we<00:01:04.710> use<00:01:04.860> wool

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
sucker for like details so we use wool

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.120 
sucker for like details so we use wool
and<00:01:05.820> place<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:08.310> becomes<00:01:08.700> our

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and place it down and that becomes our

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.270 
and place it down and that becomes our
mattress<00:01:11.130> material<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.850> guess<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:13.159> we'll<00:01:14.159> do

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
mattress material I guess and we'll do

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
mattress material I guess and we'll do
red<00:01:17.280> wool<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.439> blanket<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.240> not

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
red wool for the blanket and then not

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
red wool for the blanket and then not
the<00:01:22.049> blanket<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> dew<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.130> itself<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the blanket like the dew way itself and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
the blanket like the dew way itself and
then<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> blanket<00:01:25.520> what

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then if you want to do a blanket what

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
then if you want to do a blanket what
you<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.210> grab<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.810> snow<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.380> mean<00:01:29.130> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you do is you grab some snow I mean you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.300 
you do is you grab some snow I mean you
can<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> any<00:01:30.030> place<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.979> tend<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
can do this in any place and I tend to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
can do this in any place and I tend to
just<00:01:32.400> put<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.729> blankets<00:01:33.119> kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.509> hanging<00:01:33.930> off

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
just put my blankets kind of hanging off

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230 
just put my blankets kind of hanging off
the<00:01:34.320> side<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.000> it's

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the side a little bit just so it's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.020 
the side a little bit just so it's
clearly<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> blanket<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.890> guess<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.630> yep

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
clearly a blanket I guess so yep

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.350 
clearly a blanket I guess so yep
simple<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:42.740> put<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> snow<00:01:43.250> underneath<00:01:43.520> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
simple just put the snow underneath so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
simple just put the snow underneath so
that<00:01:44.390> it's<00:01:44.630> continuous<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> outside<00:01:45.979> I

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
that it's continuous on the outside I

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.060 
that it's continuous on the outside I
mean<00:01:46.909> obviously<00:01:47.119> in<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:48.440> mode<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.799> see

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
mean obviously in that mode you can see

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.190 
mean obviously in that mode you can see
it<00:01:49.159> but<00:01:49.310> like<00:01:49.430> this<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.690> can't<00:01:50.930> tell<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it but like this you you can't tell the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.149 
it but like this you you can't tell the
difference<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:53.140> once<00:01:54.140> you've<00:01:54.320> done<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.560> you

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
difference so once you've done that you

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.300 
difference so once you've done that you
put<00:01:55.369> your<00:01:56.050> your<00:01:57.050> snow<00:01:57.649> caps<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.130> top

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.090 
put your your snow caps on the top
height<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.970> 78<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.110> also<00:02:00.259> grab<00:02:00.740> your<00:02:00.920> snow

mean<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.030> could<00:02:14.150> put<00:02:14.590> these<00:02:15.590> slabs<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.489> top<00:02:16.700> as

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
mean you could put these slabs on top as

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.540 
mean you could put these slabs on top as
well<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.570> make<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.870> look<00:02:17.959> more<00:02:18.170> continuous

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
well to make it look more continuous

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.580 
well to make it look more continuous
whoops<00:02:19.870> lips<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:22.000> yeah<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.989> simple

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
whoops lips and yeah that's a simple

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.220 
whoops lips and yeah that's a simple
simple<00:02:25.550> simple<00:02:25.610> bit<00:02:26.120> then<00:02:26.780> if<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.019> want<00:02:27.170> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
simple simple bit then if you want to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.550 
simple simple bit then if you want to
make<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.530> more<00:02:28.870> luxurious<00:02:29.870> looking<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.319> guess

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
make it more luxurious looking I guess

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.759 
make it more luxurious looking I guess
you<00:02:31.430> could<00:02:31.459> also<00:02:31.700> do<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.090> fence<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:33.739> I

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
you could also do this with fence but I

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.250 
you could also do this with fence but I
think<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.220> looks<00:02:34.360> slightly<00:02:35.360> better<00:02:35.720> when<00:02:36.140> you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
think it looks slightly better when you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.180 
think it looks slightly better when you
do<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.530> with<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:37.100> whole<00:02:38.000> block<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.890> as<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.010> can

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
do it with a whole block and as you can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.680 
do it with a whole block and as you can
see<00:02:40.220> I'm<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.819> turning<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.239> into<00:02:41.540> a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
see I'm just turning this into a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.100 
see I'm just turning this into a
four-poster<00:02:42.410> bed<00:02:42.880> instead<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.450> he's<00:02:44.870> being

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110

some<00:04:48.740> decoration<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:50.390> lot<00:04:50.600> of<00:04:50.630> people<00:04:50.750> have

some decoration and a lot of people have

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.740 
some decoration and a lot of people have
been<00:04:51.170> saying<00:04:51.470> oh<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.740> used<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.160> know<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:52.520> much

been saying oh you used to know so much

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.930 
been saying oh you used to know so much
the<00:04:53.750> reason<00:04:54.080> is<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.230> if<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.950> mean<00:04:55.430> if<00:04:55.610> they<00:04:55.790> had

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
the reason is that if I mean if they had

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.660 
the reason is that if I mean if they had
more<00:04:56.210> coverings<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:58.490> were
