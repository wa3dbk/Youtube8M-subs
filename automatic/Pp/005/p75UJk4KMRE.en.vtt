00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.299
 it's worth here I bring silver glitter 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.740
 ideal to give it a little shine on 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.410
 all 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.030
 when we want to do by tables for the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 Christmas 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.060
 that we see that the paint has dried 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 no problem 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.360
 how we have the painting of life 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 we will scatter a little more 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 painting 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.020
 it is not necessary in the center part 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020
 because there is the candle 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.360
 if not for nothing 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.360
 and what will happen 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:53.160
 that the glitter will catch 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.160
 you have to watch to go putting little by little 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.840
 the excess glitter always remains a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.940
 bit 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.570
 we can reintroduce it 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 here 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.420
 like when we pick up the newspaper what 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.030
 we fold 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.470
 We can not be in placing a small dish or 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 try to put it back in the boat 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.659
 if it stays very crowded in some 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.340
 point 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.450
 we can spread it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.450
 with the fingers 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.830
 of even more 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.140
 we had a little water with 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.140
 painting 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.450
 then the one that hooks the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.450
 edges we can re-engage 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.750
 let's wait a few minutes 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.480
 and here we have our candle holder with 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.989
 simple purpurina needed neither 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.989
 nothing 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.500
 if you want it to be very strong because 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.500
 has been confined here a little 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.430
 to 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.040
 perfect 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.040
 i 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 Now we put the candle and we have a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.879
 precious for body tasks 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.879
 and after glitter
