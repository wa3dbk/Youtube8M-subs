00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.500
 hello guys let's discover things 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:07.240
 on planet earth that site that is 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.060
 our environment and that both 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.090
 we do not know the first thing rope 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.860
 important the planet earth has shape 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.310
 more or less of expresses 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.499
 more or less hand though part 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.029
 from the poles above and below is 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.679
 a little bit will crush very little 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:29.619
 little bit but it's not a perfect sphere 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.869
 the planet earth what is the part 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.870
 where we live we can divide it in two 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:39.340
 halves that are not equal the first 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.830
 part is covered with water and the second 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.150
 part is covered with earth that you think 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.150
 which is more water or land 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.340
 that's water if we split the planet in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.260
 three parts two parts would be water and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 a series of land in accordance as 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.360
 the body of the people two parts are 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 of water and the other part is earth skin 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.520
 agree then separately so that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 we can live, we need 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 oxygen true then around the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 earth there is a layer of air that has the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 oxygen and other gases that layer of air 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.300
 it's called atmosphere in addition in the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.310
 atmosphere 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.770
 there are other layers with gases that we 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 protect for example the rays and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.440
 damaging of the sun in agreement looks 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.619
 how is the earth look like the earth the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.430
 Earth in motion rotates in two ways 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.910
 about itself or around the sun 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.720
 we understand if the earth we see how it goes 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.460
 turning on itself imagine to see 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 look here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 imagine for example this phone 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.460
 this phone is like the earth and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 you are the sun 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.140
 that is the movement of the day and of the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.880
 night at the moment when we 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.310
 we are here 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.770
 the day that, as it changes, it becomes 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.440
 this movement lasts one day and is called 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 of rotation because it spins on 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.610
 to write 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.600
 in agreement 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.600
 like that movement 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.989
 here will give sunlight the part of the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.640
 planet that gives you sunlight is the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.640
 part of the planet that does not give light 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.260
 solar is at night and how light arrives 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.349
 straight on the earth is also a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.150
 little inclined there is a bit here is 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.290
 at night all day as I told you 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.060
 when we talk about the sun let's go over 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.060
 we live on the planet earth 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.469
 the earth moves so much on itself 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.469
 as around the sun when the earth 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.660
 gives place to day and night to give a 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.890
 It takes 24 hours a day for a day 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.640
 at night 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.620
 and we are here now would give sun 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.710
 and when we are upside down I would not give the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.440
 sun here would be day and now it would be 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.650
 We understand tacticians 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.650
 soon
