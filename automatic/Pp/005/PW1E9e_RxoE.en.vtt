00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.710
 details in pink sorry if I do topics 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.600
 in pink it is likely that it is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.160
 doing in blue at least those who 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.340
 they are asking me what I'm going to do in blue 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.440
 for the boys and good as if they see it 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.930
 you have almost all the details 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.879
 in rosita this game here is white 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.070
 you even can put you more 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.660
 transparent if they want when they give 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.269
 click on customize and color 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.590
 window can give you 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.200
 a little more transparency like that is 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.049
 white but it looks really nice 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.610

 install third party themes do not forget 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.310
 that they have to have patched their 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.520
 system or they have to have a program 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.250
 more or less this I'm going to leave you in the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.599
 description of the video so that more or 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.909

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:41.319
