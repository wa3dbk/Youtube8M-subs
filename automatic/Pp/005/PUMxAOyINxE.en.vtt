the right hand side but I'm excited for
these<00:03:06.450> three<00:03:06.720> maps<00:03:07.019> if<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.440> play<00:03:07.739> out

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
these three maps if they play out

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.069 
these three maps if they play out
anywhere<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.610> near<00:03:08.880> as<00:03:08.910> good<00:03:09.329> as<00:03:09.599> they<00:03:09.720> look

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
anywhere as near as good as they look

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.930 
anywhere as near as good as they look
because<00:03:10.530> these<00:03:10.680> images<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.280> my<00:03:11.370> opinion<00:03:11.760> look

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
because these images and my opinion look

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.030 
because these images and my opinion look
very<00:03:12.209> very<00:03:12.450> cool<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> hopefully<00:03:13.319> we'll<00:03:13.799> have
