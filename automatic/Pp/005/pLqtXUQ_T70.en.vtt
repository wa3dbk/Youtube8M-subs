enough to send over a copy of madden 15

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.900 
enough to send over a copy of madden 15
for<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.509> xbox<00:00:06.990> one<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.309> basically<00:00:08.519> my

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
for the xbox one so this is basically my

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.089 
for the xbox one so this is basically my
first<00:00:09.269> game<00:00:09.540> on<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.929> just<00:00:10.139> checking<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
first game on it just checking it out I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.799 
first game on it just checking it out I
think<00:00:11.400> it's<00:00:11.519> only<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.849> rookie<00:00:12.210> settings<00:00:12.599> right

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
think it's only on rookie settings right

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.770 
think it's only on rookie settings right
now<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:14.120> obviously<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> be

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
now so I obviously it's going to be

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.250 
now so I obviously it's going to be
pretty<00:00:15.960> easy<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.770> really<00:00:17.640> not<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> big

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
most of the teams i know all the major

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.340 
most of the teams i know all the major
players<00:04:13.100> obviously<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.300> not<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:15.140> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
players obviously but not it's the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.380

little<00:04:15.500> guys<00:04:15.770> that<00:04:16.100> matter<00:04:16.310> well<00:04:17.210> not<00:04:17.330> really

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
little guys that matter well not really

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.260 
little guys that matter well not really
little<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.290> especially<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.489> game<00:04:19.760> some

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
little but especially in this game some

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.630 
little but especially in this game some
of<00:04:20.299> them<00:04:20.480> i<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> muscles<00:04:21.980> are<00:04:22.100> maybe<00:04:22.430> a

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
of them i think the muscles are maybe a

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.090 
of them i think the muscles are maybe a
little<00:04:22.850> bit<00:04:23.060> too<00:04:23.240> big<00:04:23.480> even<00:04:23.720> though

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
little bit too big even though

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.320 
little bit too big even though
our<00:04:24.160> football<00:04:24.400> players<00:04:24.850> some<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
our football players some of the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.720 
our football players some of the
quarterback<00:04:25.810> models<00:04:26.410> are<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.890> little<00:04:27.250> intense

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
quarterback models are a little intense

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.960
