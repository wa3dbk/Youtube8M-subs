00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
different types of questions the first

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.720 
different types of questions the first
one<00:00:15.300> being<00:00:15.480> open<00:00:16.260> or<00:00:16.379> open-ended<00:00:17.130> questions

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
one being open or open-ended questions

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.050 
one being open or open-ended questions
and<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.840> stores<00:00:19.310> questions<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:20.520> begin<00:00:20.910> with

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and it stores questions which begin with

and it stores questions which begin with
who<00:00:21.300> what<00:00:21.660> where<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.440> why<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:24.140> and

who what where when why and how and

who what where when why and how and
second<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.400> closed<00:00:27.119> questions<00:00:27.660> where<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
second is closed questions where the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.950 
second is closed questions where the
customer<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:28.980> answer<00:00:29.190> yes<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.029> no<00:00:30.359> now

customer can only answer yes or no now

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.389 
customer can only answer yes or no now
I've<00:00:31.109> always<00:00:31.439> found<00:00:31.619> those<00:00:31.980> techniques

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
I've always found those techniques

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.849 
I've always found those techniques
problematic<00:00:33.210> quite<00:00:33.569> simply<00:00:34.019> because<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.679> I

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
problematic quite simply because if I

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.919 
problematic quite simply because if I
was<00:00:35.039> to<00:00:35.069> ask<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> question<00:00:35.699> what<00:00:36.179> is<00:00:36.899> your

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
was to ask you the question what is your

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.169 
was to ask you the question what is your
favorite<00:00:37.109> color<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.069> you<00:00:38.670> said<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.120> example

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
favorite color and you said for example

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.729 
favorite color and you said for example
red<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.589> have<00:00:40.739> asked<00:00:41.100> five<00:00:41.600> words<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.019> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
red then I have asked five words and you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
red then I have asked five words and you
said<00:00:44.069> one<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.749> really<00:00:45.929> open<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
said one so that's not really open it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.469 
said one so that's not really open it's
not<00:00:46.739> getting<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.729> customers<00:00:48.179> to<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.449> a

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
not getting you the customers to do a

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.399 
not getting you the customers to do a
lot<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.019> talking<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.799> and<00:00:50.639> the<00:00:50.909> second<00:00:51.409> close

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
lot of talking and and the second close

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.039 
lot of talking and and the second close
question<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.429> I<00:00:53.579> ask<00:00:53.909> you<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> question<00:00:54.299> such<00:00:54.809> as

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:55.049 
question if I ask you a question such as

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.649 
question if I ask you a question such as
are<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.799> right<00:00:56.159> or<00:00:56.429> left-handed<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.510> that's

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
are you right or left-handed well that's

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.329 
are you right or left-handed well that's
a<00:00:57.749> closed<00:00:57.989> question<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.920> answer<00:00:59.219> isn't

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
a closed question what the answer isn't

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.369 
a closed question what the answer isn't
yes<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.819> no<00:01:00.089> so<00:01:00.569> the<00:01:00.659> techniques<00:01:01.049> are<00:01:01.229> a<00:01:01.260> little

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
yes or no so the techniques are a little

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.529 
yes or no so the techniques are a little
bit<00:01:01.559> problematic<00:01:01.819> so<00:01:02.819> the<00:01:02.909> techniques<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
bit problematic so the techniques that I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.130 
bit problematic so the techniques that I
teach<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.890> using<00:01:05.520> mine<00:01:05.670> sales<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.360> actually

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
teach and using mine sales are actually

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.680 
teach and using mine sales are actually
taken<00:01:07.800> from<00:01:07.830> journalism<00:01:08.640> they<00:01:09.570> work

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
taken from journalism they work

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.440 
taken from journalism they work
incredibly<00:01:09.870> well<00:01:10.410> in<00:01:10.740> sales<00:01:10.980> if<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.910> journalist

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
incredibly well in sales if a journalist

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
incredibly well in sales if a journalist
is<00:01:12.660> interviewing<00:01:13.200> somebody<00:01:13.410> then<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is interviewing somebody then the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
is interviewing somebody then the
audience<00:01:14.850> or<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.120> reader<00:01:15.710> wants<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.830> hear

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
audience or the reader wants to hear

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
audience or the reader wants to hear
from<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.310> person<00:01:17.640> being<00:01:17.760> interviewed<00:01:18.350> not

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
from the person being interviewed not

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
from the person being interviewed not
the<00:01:19.560> interviewer<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.600> much<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> same

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the interviewer and that's much the same

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
the interviewer and that's much the same
as<00:01:22.260> we<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.560> same<00:01:23.100> situation<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> have

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
as we have same situation that we have

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
as we have same situation that we have
in<00:01:24.120> sales<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.050> person<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.470> should<00:01:25.500> be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
in sales so the person we should be

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.680 
in sales so the person we should be
hearing<00:01:26.040> from<00:01:26.190> in<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.730> sales<00:01:27.030> situation<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
hearing from in a sales situation is the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.250 
hearing from in a sales situation is the
customer<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:29.010> more<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.460> yourself<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.510> the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
customer a lot more than yourself so the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.780 
customer a lot more than yourself so the
technique<00:01:31.800> of<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.070> room<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.310> real<00:01:32.460> actually

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
technique of the room for real actually

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
technique of the room for real actually
have<00:01:32.910> three<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:33.300> layers<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> question

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have three different layers of question

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.760 
have three different layers of question
the<00:01:35.100> first<00:01:35.630> open<00:01:36.630> questions<00:01:37.110> we'll<00:01:37.320> call<00:01:37.590> them

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the first open questions we'll call them

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
the first open questions we'll call them
they're<00:01:38.190> not<00:01:38.280> strictly<00:01:38.730> speaking<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
they're not strictly speaking on a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
they're not strictly speaking on a
grammatical<00:01:39.990> basis<00:01:40.320> anyway<00:01:40.620> questions<00:01:41.520> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
grammatical basis anyway questions it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.640 
grammatical basis anyway questions it's
all<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.180> instructions<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.290> things<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
all the more instructions or things you

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.820 
all the more instructions or things you
can<00:01:43.830> use<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.370> get<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> customer<00:01:45.420> talking<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
can use to get the customer talking so

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.140 
can use to get the customer talking so
they'll<00:01:46.980> be<00:01:47.100> used<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.430> example<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.000> you're

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
they'll be used for example if you're

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.590 
they'll be used for example if you're
sat<00:01:48.420> beginning<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.200> sales<00:01:49.440> meeting<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:51.510> get
