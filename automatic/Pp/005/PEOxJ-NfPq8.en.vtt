yes<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.380> think<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.890> most<00:02:11.070> important<00:02:11.640> thing

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
yes I I think the most important thing

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.760 
yes I I think the most important thing
is<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.210> brand<00:02:12.540> always<00:02:12.870> has<00:02:13.050> has<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.620> an

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is that a brand always has has to be an

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
is that a brand always has has to be an
extension<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.520> personality<00:02:17.360> me<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.540> an

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
extension of your personality me as an

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.300 
extension of your personality me as an
individual<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> stand<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.770> certain<00:02:19.920> things

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
individual you stand for certain things

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.510 
individual you stand for certain things
and<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.530> brand<00:02:22.800> nose<00:02:22.980> has<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> have

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and I think the brand nose has to have

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.760 
and I think the brand nose has to have
similar<00:02:23.760> values<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:29.990> think<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.290> depends<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
similar values I think it depends I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.260 
similar values I think it depends I
think<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.040> depends<00:02:32.430> from<00:02:32.490> from<00:02:32.940> brand<00:02:33.180> to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
think it depends from from brand to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990 
think it depends from from brand to
brand<00:02:33.360> there's<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.490> VOC<00:02:35.730> for

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
brand there's you know for for VOC for

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.560 
brand there's you know for for VOC for
example<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> fact<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.560> a
