00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
first try to take them out but after

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:47.759 
first try to take them out but after
that<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.260> calm<00:02:38.740> down

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.710 

so<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:48.950> female<00:02:49.400> here<00:02:49.640> was<00:02:49.790> produced<00:02:50.269> by<00:02:50.510> me

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
so this female here was produced by me

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.630 
so this female here was produced by me
she<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.650> out<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.420> espresso<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.840> Hershey<00:02:54.200> and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
she is out of espresso and Hershey and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.570 
she is out of espresso and Hershey and
this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.060> quad<00:02:56.420> stripe<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.430> went

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
this is a quad stripe I think I went

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580 
this is a quad stripe I think I went
over<00:02:58.879> this<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.239> one<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.690> previous<00:02:59.900> videos

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
over this in one of the previous videos

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.890 
over this in one of the previous videos
but<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.950> those<00:03:01.370> who<00:03:01.549> don't<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.900> quad

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
but for those who don't know quad

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.070 
but for those who don't know quad
stripes<00:03:03.319> are<00:03:03.620> pinstripes<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:05.299> have<00:03:05.569> to

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
stripes are pinstripes that have to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.539 
stripes are pinstripes that have to
perfect<00:03:06.910> lateral<00:03:07.910> lines<00:03:08.180> along<00:03:08.660> their<00:03:08.900> sides

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
perfect lateral lines along their sides

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.780 
perfect lateral lines along their sides
the<00:03:10.549> lateral<00:03:11.390> lines<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.769> it's<00:03:13.579> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the lateral lines is like it's the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.240 
the lateral lines is like it's the
Harlequin<00:03:14.390> pattern<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:15.019> for<00:03:15.230> some<00:03:15.470> reason<00:03:15.920> a

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
Harlequin pattern but for some reason a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.759 
Harlequin pattern but for some reason a
lot<00:03:16.909> of<00:03:16.970> times<00:03:17.299> with<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> pinstripe<00:03:18.200> gene<00:03:18.500> it

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
lot of times with a pinstripe gene it

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.020 
lot of times with a pinstripe gene it
turns<00:03:19.519> out<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.060> form<00:03:20.660> two<00:03:21.049> straight<00:03:21.440> lines<00:03:22.030> on

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
turns out to form two straight lines on

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.650 
turns out to form two straight lines on
each<00:03:23.269> side<00:03:23.599> of<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.900> gecko<00:03:24.670> these<00:03:25.670> this

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
each side of the gecko these this

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.770 
each side of the gecko these this
mutation<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.500> not<00:03:27.739> very<00:03:28.160> common<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.599> is

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
mutation is not very common and it is

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.210 
mutation is not very common and it is
very<00:03:30.170> sought<00:03:30.530> after<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.500> consider<00:03:33.950> this

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
very sought after so so I consider this

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.280 
very sought after so so I consider this
girl<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.640> be<00:03:34.670> very<00:03:35.060> special<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:35.780> top<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.109> that

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
girl to be very special on top of that

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.520 
girl to be very special on top of that
she<00:03:36.590> has<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.799> bunch<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.489> cream<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.720> very<00:03:39.200> nice

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
she has a bunch of cream and a very nice

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.099 
she has a bunch of cream and a very nice
and<00:03:39.859> clean<00:03:40.480> lavender<00:03:41.480> pattern<00:03:41.930> on<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.010> base

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
and clean lavender pattern on the base

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.640 
and clean lavender pattern on the base
I<00:03:45.140> should<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:45.920> say<00:03:46.190> colors<00:03:46.670> got<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.879> pattern<00:03:47.150> but

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
I should I say colors got a pattern but

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.670 
I should I say colors got a pattern but
anyways<00:03:49.060> yes<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.780> can<00:03:50.810> see<00:03:51.079> she<00:03:51.290> also<00:03:51.410> has

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
anyways yes as you can see she also has

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.339 
anyways yes as you can see she also has
some<00:03:51.889> beautiful<00:03:52.430> Dalmatian<00:03:53.299> spots<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.930> I

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
some beautiful Dalmatian spots and I

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.229 
some beautiful Dalmatian spots and I
think<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.739> Dalmatian<00:03:55.250> spots<00:03:55.400> complement

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
think the Dalmatian spots complement

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.809 
think the Dalmatian spots complement
these<00:03:56.870> pins<00:03:57.260> friends<00:03:57.560> very<00:03:57.769> well<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:58.370> lot<00:03:58.790> of

these pins friends very well a lot of

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.270 
these pins friends very well a lot of
people<00:03:59.150> don't<00:03:59.359> like<00:03:59.510> them<00:03:59.959> on<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.769> pinstripes

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
people don't like them on the pinstripes

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.319 
people don't like them on the pinstripes
but<00:04:01.549> personally<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.829> don't<00:04:03.950> see<00:04:04.310> why<00:04:04.549> why

but personally I see I don't see why why

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:20.060 
but personally I see I don't see why why
not<00:04:05.599> why<00:04:06.040> they<00:04:07.040> shouldn't<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.609> on
