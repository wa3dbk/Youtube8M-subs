00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.650
 we are about to put gasoline fill 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.650
 the tank with the tablets 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.020
 open this is the third tablet that 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.300
 I put in my vehicle 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 I'm driving a Mercedes Benz of 3 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.730
 andrÃ© from 2011 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 let's see here I'll show you the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.079
 miren tablet 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.870
 let's put in the tank 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.690
 and as you can see it's a bit difficult to do this 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.030
 yourself here is already we put the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.899
 tablet you can see it now 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:52.960
 let's proceed to do what is the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:56.450
 procedure here we will see 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.880
 we put the you see the types of that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.700
 we have here 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.480
 let's see I usually do not use the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.480
 of 93 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.520
 and I normally used the 87 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.030
 so let's see how many gallons we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.030
 grab 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.659
 it's fine we want it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.650
 let's see that the tablet you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 can see we put here let's see 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.390
 we take 7 and we will fill to see 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.440
 how many balls 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.240
 with this you can see here 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.760
 the tablets is what we are 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.660
 using this is the third tablet 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.580
 that I put in my vehicle mercedes 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.580
 benz as you can see well 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 We are putting gasoline on it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.930
 last we had approximately with the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.580
 second tablet you are going to see 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.950
 right now we were going 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.319
 to go inside the car and go to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.489
 put it now but 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.170
 you can see here we are and can 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.280
 see appreciate 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.280
 we'll see 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.209
 325 miles was what we got with the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.640
 full tank the last time then 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.950
 now let's zero 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 our miles so that you can 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.670
 can appreciate not turning on the car 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.500
 to be able to do that but those were 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.840
 rings that he gave us earlier with the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.400
 tank previously right now as soon as 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.890
 let's learn from the car let's be able to put 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840
 this in zero to be able to check 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.280
 how many miles does it give us the only thing that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.670
 I can say is that I have checked the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.950
 beginning the first time from the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.700
 first time I install you of the put 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.760
 sorry that you 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.590
 the tablets 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.610
 first started noticing what was the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.610
 truck start 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:29.180
 even though he was using me 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.180
 gasolines of 93 and 987 that was giving 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.690
 extremes 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:41.730
 let's observe together 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.690
 15 gallons 37.87 the price of the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 petrol is 2.49 is what we're going to do 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.099
 now let's close here and we're going to 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.230
 put our miles meter in zeros 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.800
 so you can check 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.800
 with me 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.800
 my mother all check with me 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.120
 number of miles that will be us 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.729
 giving the vehicle that seeks to return by 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.090
 the receipt was forgotten to be able to do 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.930
 the account later tell me and already 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.470
 we are getting by a heel of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.830
 Achilles 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.970
 even the dot is lit here 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.740
 let's have let's see to put this 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.280
 is zero and even there the children who 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.980
 we had 325 miles, we're going to put it in 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.680
 zero 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.930
 and let me see 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.930
 the level how we have to do this 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.699
 and I forgot then let's see 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.650
 to see and see 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.449
 what what 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.830
 t 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:09.120
 let's see then we put the miles 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.520
 there is present 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.620
 because there it is perfect we already have 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.629
 our half of miles at zero after 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.729
 we talk to give you the results that 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.050
 Have a good day everyone and see that 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.659
 the tablets can use us in 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.659
 any kind of car thank you very much
