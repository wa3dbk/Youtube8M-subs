show you how to incorporate it into an

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.320 
show you how to incorporate it into an
eye<00:00:16.720> design<00:00:17.109> so<00:00:17.949> if<00:00:18.100> I'm<00:00:18.250> gonna<00:00:18.400> be<00:00:18.609> doing<00:00:18.640> more

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
eye design so if I'm gonna be doing more

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.230 
eye design so if I'm gonna be doing more
of<00:00:19.420> like<00:00:19.630> I<00:00:19.900> would<00:00:20.470> say<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.980> texturized<00:00:21.880> look

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
of like I would say a texturized look

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.570 
of like I would say a texturized look
for<00:00:22.539> an<00:00:22.630> animal<00:00:22.869> marking<00:00:23.590> maybe<00:00:24.130> something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
for an animal marking maybe something

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.160 
for an animal marking maybe something
that<00:00:24.610> would<00:00:24.820> be<00:00:24.940> on<00:00:24.970> a<00:00:25.090> reptile<00:00:25.630> or<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.900> giraffe

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
that would be on a reptile or a giraffe

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.500 
that would be on a reptile or a giraffe
or<00:00:26.710> even<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.490> could<00:00:27.699> combine<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.330> make

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
or even you could combine it to make

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.210 
or even you could combine it to make
something<00:00:28.990> sort<00:00:29.289> of<00:00:29.380> like<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.560> cheetah<00:00:29.980> or<00:00:30.100> a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
something sort of like a cheetah or a

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.189 
something sort of like a cheetah or a
leopard<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:31.240> I<00:00:31.300> would<00:00:31.480> start<00:00:31.840> off<00:00:31.960> with<00:00:32.169> a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
leopard so I would start off with a

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.910 
leopard so I would start off with a
goldish<00:00:32.859> background<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:35.350> with<00:00:35.620> a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
goldish background and then with a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.369 
goldish background and then with a
darker<00:00:36.699> or<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:36.909> brighter<00:00:37.329> color<00:00:37.719> like<00:00:38.199> an

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
darker or a brighter color like an

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.629 
darker or a brighter color like an
orange<00:00:38.859> I<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:40.329> just<00:00:40.569> add<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.920> markings

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:42.639 
orange I would just add the markings

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:44.489 
orange I would just add the markings
now<00:00:42.819> with<00:00:42.999> the<00:00:43.120> markings<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.870> want<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.350> make

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:44.499 
now with the markings you want to make

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.099 
now with the markings you want to make
sure<00:00:44.530> that<00:00:44.979> you're<00:00:45.249> going<00:00:45.850> from<00:00:46.120> thin<00:00:46.719> to

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
sure that you're going from thin to

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.860 
sure that you're going from thin to
thick<00:00:47.139> to<00:00:47.710> big<00:00:48.069> to<00:00:48.339> small<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.479> make<00:00:49.690> sure

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
thick to big to small just to make sure

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.139 
thick to big to small just to make sure
that<00:00:50.019> you're<00:00:50.199> getting<00:00:50.319> a<00:00:50.530> nice<00:00:50.739> variation<00:00:51.219> so

involves a little bit of wiggling too
now<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.460> switch<00:01:54.970> brushes<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.690> went<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> round

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
now I switch brushes I went to a round

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.860 
now I switch brushes I went to a round
brush<00:01:57.010> with<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.610> point<00:01:57.970> on<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.300> end<00:01:58.450> where

brush with a point on the end where

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560 
brush with a point on the end where
before<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.470> was<00:01:59.770> using<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.220> flat<00:02:00.550> brush<00:02:00.790> or<00:02:01.180> you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.200 
before I was using a flat brush or you
can<00:02:01.780> use<00:02:01.990> your<00:02:02.020> chisel<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.760> doesn't<00:02:04.090> make

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
can use your chisel and it doesn't make

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.360 
can use your chisel and it doesn't make
that<00:02:04.390> much<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.930> difference<00:02:05.080> but<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:05.860> use<00:02:06.190> my

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
that much of a difference but I use my

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.580 
that much of a difference but I use my
round<00:02:06.640> brush<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:07.150> everything<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:08.319> I'm<00:02:08.409> gonna

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
round brush for everything so I'm gonna

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
and then come up on the point and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.090 
and then come up on the point and
do<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.520> again<00:02:16.120> lay<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> a

your brush down flat lift up come up on
the<00:02:52.240> point<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.320> can<00:02:53.650> close<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the point so that you can close to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.080 
the point so that you can close to
really<00:02:54.970> make<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> lot<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.870> fun<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.880> can

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
add some color inside either some white

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.980 
add some color inside either some white
or<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.740> hint<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.190> orange<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.630> really

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
or just a hint of orange and that really

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:15.060 
or just a hint of orange and that really
live-ins<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:13.080> animal<00:03:14.080> faces<00:03:14.380> are<00:03:14.709> some<00:03:14.920> of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
live-ins it up animal faces are some of

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:24.650 
live-ins it up animal faces are some of
my<00:03:15.100> favorite

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600 

see<00:03:25.200> how<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> white<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:26.010> makes<00:03:26.220> everything

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
see how the white just makes everything

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.370 
see how the white just makes everything
pop<00:03:28.790> now<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.060> another<00:03:30.360> type<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> animal<00:03:31.020> and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
pop now for another type of animal and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.100 
pop now for another type of animal and
probably<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.980> most<00:03:32.130> popular<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.600> tiger

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
probably the most popular is the tiger

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.490 
probably the most popular is the tiger
and<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.130> many<00:03:35.370> people<00:03:35.750> lose<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.050> design

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
and so many people lose the design

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
and so many people lose the design
because<00:03:38.010> they<00:03:38.160> can't<00:03:38.460> get<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.820> type<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.090> Tiger

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
because they can't get the type of Tiger

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.590 
because they can't get the type of Tiger
striping<00:03:39.960> right<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> good<00:03:42.120> thing

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
striping right so this is a good thing

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.380 
striping right so this is a good thing
or<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.930> good<00:03:43.200> technique<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.710> practice<00:03:44.430> it's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
or a good technique to practice it's

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.940 
or a good technique to practice it's
going<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.660> involve<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.110> lot<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.290> laying<00:03:46.650> down

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
going to involve a lot of laying down

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.890 
going to involve a lot of laying down
and<00:03:47.160> wiggling<00:03:47.610> but<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.150> you'll<00:03:48.330> want<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> do

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and wiggling but what you'll want to do

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.010 
and wiggling but what you'll want to do
is<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.710> groups<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.190> threes<00:03:50.720> going<00:03:51.720> big

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
is do it in groups of threes going big

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.240 
is do it in groups of threes going big
to<00:03:52.380> small<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.280> lay<00:03:53.550> your<00:03:53.760> brush<00:03:54.090> down<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:55.250> lift

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
to small so lay your brush down and lift

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.350 
to small so lay your brush down and lift
up<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.840> want<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.230> lay<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.560> down<00:03:58.590> again<00:03:59.100> and

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
up and you want to lay it down again and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.430 
up and you want to lay it down again and
follow<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.630> line<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.110> lift<00:04:01.470> up<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:04.020> training

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
follow that line and lift up so training

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.330 
follow that line and lift up so training
groups<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:05.070> three<00:04:05.630> lay<00:04:06.630> your<00:04:06.870> brush<00:04:07.140> down<00:04:07.500> give

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
groups of three lay your brush down give

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.960 
groups of three lay your brush down give
it<00:04:08.490> a<00:04:08.580> wiggle<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.210> lift<00:04:10.140> up<00:04:10.460> lay<00:04:11.460> your<00:04:11.670> brush

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970

it a wiggle and lift up lay your brush
down<00:04:12.300> give<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.320> wiggle<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.860> lift<00:04:14.580> up<00:04:14.850> lay

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
down give it a wiggle and lift up lay

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.870 
down give it a wiggle and lift up lay
your<00:04:15.810> brush<00:04:16.080> down<00:04:16.130> give<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.340> wiggle<00:04:17.549> and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
your brush down give it a wiggle and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.240 
your brush down give it a wiggle and
lift<00:04:18.239> up<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:19.049> way<00:04:19.320> they're<00:04:19.560> all<00:04:19.709> heading<00:04:20.160> in

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
lift up that way they're all heading in

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.340 
lift up that way they're all heading in
the<00:04:20.370> same<00:04:20.400> direction<00:04:20.900> because<00:04:21.900> Tiger

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
the same direction because Tiger

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.130 
the same direction because Tiger
markings<00:04:22.830> are<00:04:23.010> grouped<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:24.540> this<00:04:24.780> would<00:04:24.990> be

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
tiger and they would all head in towards

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.340 
tiger and they would all head in towards
the<00:04:29.340> eye<00:04:29.510> now<00:04:30.510> in<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> middle<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.230> the
