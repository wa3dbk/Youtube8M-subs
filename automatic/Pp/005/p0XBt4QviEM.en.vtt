00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.100 
the next thing you have to do is you
need<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.730> set<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> exposure<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> camera

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
need to set the exposure on the camera

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.900 
need to set the exposure on the camera
so<00:03:10.290> you're<00:03:10.470> in<00:03:10.590> manual<00:03:11.070> mode<00:03:11.100> here<00:03:11.610> you're

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
so you're in manual mode here you're

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.790 
so you're in manual mode here you're
gonna<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.210> ahead<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
gonna go ahead and get out of the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.120 
gonna go ahead and get out of the
function<00:03:14.190> menu<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:14.610> hanging<00:03:14.790> function<00:03:15.240> here

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
function menu but hanging function here

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.800 
function menu but hanging function here
okay<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.370> then<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.910> need<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.120> adjust<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
okay and then you need to adjust the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.260 
okay and then you need to adjust the
shutter<00:03:19.080> speed<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:20.370> usually<00:03:20.790> put<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> shutter

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
shutter speed I usually put the shutter

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.420 
shutter speed I usually put the shutter
speed<00:03:21.450> between<00:03:21.930> 100<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.440> 200<00:03:22.620> we'll<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.280> put

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
speed between 100 and 200 we'll just put

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.400 
speed between 100 and 200 we'll just put
out<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.550> hundred<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.140> aperture

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
out a hundred right now and the aperture

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.050 
out a hundred right now and the aperture
on<00:03:25.650> these<00:03:25.800> cameras<00:03:26.280> doesn't<00:03:26.580> have<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.790> be<00:03:26.940> as

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
on these cameras doesn't have to be as

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.780 
on these cameras doesn't have to be as
high<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.440> DSLR<00:03:29.010> because<00:03:29.340> they<00:03:29.459> have<00:03:29.580> more

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
high as a DSLR because they have more

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130 
high as a DSLR because they have more
depth<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.150> field<00:03:30.330> or<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:30.810> other<00:03:30.959> words

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
depth of field or in other words

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.960 
depth of field or in other words
everything's<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.770> sharp<00:03:32.010> focus<00:03:32.070> especially

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
everything's in sharp focus especially

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780 
everything's in sharp focus especially
is<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> fuse<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.020> wide-angle<00:03:34.260> lens<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.950> f/4<00:03:35.670> is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
is a fuse a wide-angle lens so f/4 is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.070 
is a fuse a wide-angle lens so f/4 is
fine<00:03:36.000> right<00:03:36.180> there<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.720> then<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.020> to

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
fine right there and then you need to

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.740 
fine right there and then you need to
change<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> ISO<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> press<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> ISO

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
change the ISO so you press the ISO

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.590 
change the ISO so you press the ISO
button<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:41.030> if<00:03:42.030> you're<00:03:42.360> using<00:03:42.480> an

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
button here and if you're using an

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840 
button here and if you're using an
external<00:03:42.660> flash<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:44.100> can<00:03:44.160> probably<00:03:44.430> set<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
external flash you can probably set it

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.570 
external flash you can probably set it
to<00:03:45.060> something<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.080> 100<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.680> 200<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.280> using

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
to something like 100 or 200 if using

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.100 
to something like 100 or 200 if using
the<00:03:47.640> on-camera<00:03:48.120> flash<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.540> might<00:03:48.690> set<00:03:48.900> around

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
the on-camera flash you might set around

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.370 
the on-camera flash you might set around
ISO<00:03:50.010> 400<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.790> those<00:03:51.540> are<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> basics<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.170> it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
ISO 400 and those are the basics of it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.009 
ISO 400 and those are the basics of it
remember<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.860> exposures<00:03:53.340> about<00:03:54.019> 1/100

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
remember the exposures about 1/100

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.720 
remember the exposures about 1/100
around<00:03:55.739> f4<00:03:56.160> iso<00:03:56.730> 100<00:03:57.540> 200<00:03:57.930> 400<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:59.280> change<00:03:59.550> it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
around f4 iso 100 200 400 just change it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.479 
around f4 iso 100 200 400 just change it
so<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.420> picture<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.780> nice<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.260> bright

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
so that the picture is nice and bright

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.479 
so that the picture is nice and bright
and<00:04:02.489> that's<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.390> basics<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.310> one<00:04:05.310> last

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
and that's the basics of it one last

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.520 
and that's the basics of it one last
thing<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.390> hole<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.200> body<00:04:07.320> used

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
thing is the hole in the body used

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.800 
thing is the hole in the body used
cameras<00:04:07.860> it's<00:04:08.010> not<00:04:08.160> centered<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.730> lens<00:04:08.970> so

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
cameras it's not centered on the lens so

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.229 
cameras it's not centered on the lens so
if<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.470> buy<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:11.100> an<00:04:11.220> L<00:04:11.340> bracket<00:04:11.820> adapter

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
if you buy like an L bracket adapter

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.000 
if you buy like an L bracket adapter
plate<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.200> hole<00:04:13.350> centered<00:04:13.800> and

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
plate you can have the hole centered and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.580 
plate you can have the hole centered and
you<00:04:14.100> can<00:04:14.220> also<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.090> hole<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.080> side<00:04:16.169> if

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
you can also have a hole on the side if

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.259 
you can also have a hole on the side if
you<00:04:16.620> want<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> mount<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.160> camera<00:04:17.340> vertically

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
you want to mount the camera vertically

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.390 
you want to mount the camera vertically
instead<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.720> horizontally<00:04:19.190> hope<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.310> found

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
instead of horizontally hope you found

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.460 
instead of horizontally hope you found
