 Casa Nord Mother Susumu 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.260
 Architect raised in snowy Hokkaido land

 Yuki Igarashi 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.610
 A house designed by him who knew by convention 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:39.060
 It's this mother Nord 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:45.110
 This house that gathered wisdom to spend comfortably even in the cold district on the theme of the north house 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.110
 We set up a wind room which is indispensable in northern country at the entrance 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 The wall uses high-performance insulation panel made by fp Corporation 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.160
 While ensuring high thermal insulation and sound insulation 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.879
 Vertical windows are randomly placed 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:11.660
 For the layout of the window, I use a high insulation panel called fp panel. 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:17.180
 The mom-dono sequences, such as no loss based on the allocation or rather its panel of the module 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.180
 It is said that the windows are arranged at random while standing up so as not to be monotonous 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.600
 I think it is a feature 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.600
 I am 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 The indoor structure is a studio structure centered on the central pillar 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 Reduce the damage by setting the height low 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:44.450
 A man who is trying to reduce the heating and cooling load 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.450
 It appears four of room to and climb the stairs to the center of the hole as a starting point 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:57.140
 By placing the call vertically and horizontally, it is possible to create a floor plan that makes the best use of floor space. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 At the same time, this little boy has another role 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:08.319
 Although you can see and get a look at on this 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.280
 It is that louver-like floor and the air is very easy to move on the floor 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:20.300
 That top light is on, and when you split the wilderness of the light and come in this way , the central part is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.800
 And in order to avoid Well it in easy to darken Te comparison is with now top light 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.610
 After Well this the movement of the wind 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 Easy to make 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.720
 Ms. Udo 's performance is not only northern countries 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:37.940
 That is also something to be able to live comfortably Oite to any location 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:44.090
 And in its comfortable box 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.600
 The idea of a creator who wants a small family society to be connected calmly is everywhere 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.600
