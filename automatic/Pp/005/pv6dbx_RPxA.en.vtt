00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.960 

compared<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.580> one

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.360 

then<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.349> just<00:03:30.500> want<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.770> watch<00:03:30.920> out<00:03:31.160> for

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
then you just want to watch out for

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.479 
then you just want to watch out for
plastic<00:03:31.879> because<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:32.900> will<00:03:33.230> scratch<00:03:33.560> plastic

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
plastic because it will scratch plastic

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.979 
plastic because it will scratch plastic
if<00:03:34.760> you're<00:03:34.879> going<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.090> go<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.360> plastic<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
if you're going to go on plastic and

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:46.949 
if you're going to go on plastic and
stuff<00:03:44.709> look<00:03:45.709> how<00:03:45.860> nice<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.280> comes<00:03:46.519> out

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
stuff look how nice that comes out

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.330 
stuff look how nice that comes out
beautiful<00:03:50.410> alright<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:51.620> make<00:03:51.830> sure<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:52.130> use

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
beautiful alright so make sure you use

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.070 
beautiful alright so make sure you use
this<00:03:52.519> technique<00:03:52.730> it's<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.239> very<00:03:53.450> very<00:03:53.750> good<00:03:53.959> way

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
this technique it's a very very good way

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.500 
this technique it's a very very good way
to<00:03:54.140> take<00:03:54.380> out<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.830> clean<00:03:55.580> up<00:03:55.760> Chrome<00:03:56.120> without

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
to take out and clean up Chrome without

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.240 
to take out and clean up Chrome without
using<00:03:56.870> compound<00:03:57.290> because<00:03:57.530> compound<00:03:58.099> does

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
using compound because compound does

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.860 
using compound because compound does
take<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.489> little<00:03:58.700> while<00:03:58.819> for<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.390> work<00:03:59.540> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
take a little while for it to work and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.500 
take a little while for it to work and
the<00:04:00.769> only<00:04:00.950> drawback<00:04:01.640> with<00:04:01.819> this<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.330> have

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
the only drawback with this is you have

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.170 
the only drawback with this is you have
to<00:04:02.660> make<00:04:02.810> sure<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.170> rinse<00:04:03.760> anything<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.970> you

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
to make sure you rinse anything that you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.930 
to make sure you rinse anything that you
do<00:04:05.450> off<00:04:05.750> with<00:04:06.349> water<00:04:06.769> because<00:04:07.130> if<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.610> don't

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
do off with water because if you don't

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.569 
do off with water because if you don't
it'll<00:04:08.630> rain<00:04:08.900> outside<00:04:09.319> you're<00:04:10.220> going<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.400> get

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
it'll rain outside you're going to get

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.940 
it'll rain outside you're going to get
this<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.630> going<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.840> create<00:04:12.079> particle

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
this this is going to create particle

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.309 
this this is going to create particle
dust<00:04:13.160> all<00:04:13.400> over<00:04:13.700> your<00:04:13.880> your<00:04:14.209> rim<00:04:14.420> right<00:04:14.630> you're

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
going to get a surface rust on all these

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.440 
going to get a surface rust on all these
particles<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.250> are<00:04:19.370> left<00:04:19.639> over<00:04:19.820> on<00:04:20.209> your

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
particles that are left over on your
