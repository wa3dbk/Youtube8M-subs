what to do you have to share let us cut
the<00:00:36.609> chocolate<00:00:37.210> part<00:00:37.480> into<00:00:38.050> two<00:00:38.379> parts<00:00:39.219> here

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the chocolate part into two parts here

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.639 
the chocolate part into two parts here
one<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.170> small<00:00:41.800> part<00:00:42.219> and<00:00:42.550> other<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.079> bigger

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
one a small part and other is the bigger

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.439 
one a small part and other is the bigger
part<00:00:45.129> as<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:47.289> is<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.440> chocolate<00:00:47.969> no<00:00:48.969> one<00:00:49.269> would

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
part as it is a chocolate no one would

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.369 
part as it is a chocolate no one would
like<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.719> take<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.379> smaller<00:00:50.769> part<00:00:51.250> right<00:00:52.379> both

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
like to take the smaller part right both

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.799 
like to take the smaller part right both
you<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.100> your<00:00:54.489> sister<00:00:54.940> would<00:00:55.089> like<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.600> have

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
you and your sister would like to have

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.849 
you and your sister would like to have
the<00:00:56.079> bigger<00:00:56.559> piece<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.300> if<00:00:58.719> we<00:00:59.260> cut<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.710> into

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
the bigger piece but if we cut it into

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.299 
the bigger piece but if we cut it into
two<00:01:00.219> equal<00:01:00.820> parts<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:02.109> there<00:01:02.620> won't<00:01:03.010> be<00:01:03.159> any

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
two equal parts then there won't be any

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.100 
two equal parts then there won't be any
fight<00:01:03.850> over<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.540> chocolate<00:01:05.190> right<00:01:06.190> children

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
fight over the chocolate right children

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.520 
fight over the chocolate right children
so<00:01:08.110> when<00:01:08.980> we<00:01:09.160> cut<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.460> whole<00:01:09.850> thing<00:01:10.240> say<00:01:11.020> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
so when we cut a whole thing say the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.670 
so when we cut a whole thing say the
chocolate<00:01:12.130> bar<00:01:12.430> into<00:01:13.300> two<00:01:13.540> equal<00:01:14.050> parts

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
chocolate bar into two equal parts

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.320 
chocolate bar into two equal parts
then<00:01:15.430> each<00:01:16.240> part<00:01:16.690> is<00:01:16.870> called<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.350> half<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.730> the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
then each part is called a half so the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.160 
then each part is called a half so the
whole<00:01:19.600> chocolate<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.380> cut<00:01:20.650> into<00:01:20.920> two<00:01:21.370> halves

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
whole chocolate is cut into two halves

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.710 
whole chocolate is cut into two halves
we<00:01:23.170> write<00:01:23.440> half<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:25.420> by<00:01:25.870> two<00:01:26.560> because<00:01:27.720> one

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
we write half as one by two because one

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.220 
we write half as one by two because one
is<00:01:28.930> cut<00:01:29.260> into<00:01:29.530> two<00:01:30.210> equal<00:01:31.210> parts<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:33.070> half<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.390> 1

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
is cut into two equal parts so half is 1

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.820 
is cut into two equal parts so half is 1
by<00:01:35.530> 2<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:36.430> this<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.510> only<00:01:37.720> way<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.200> cut<00:01:38.620> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
by 2 is this the only way to cut the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.050 
by 2 is this the only way to cut the
chocolate<00:01:39.070> bar<00:01:39.550> into<00:01:39.940> halves<00:01:40.440> no<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.790> are

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
chocolate bar into halves no there are

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.720 
chocolate bar into halves no there are
other<00:01:43.330> ways<00:01:43.570> too

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
other ways too

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.360 
other ways too
first<00:01:45.730> we<00:01:46.360> cut<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.810> vertically<00:01:47.500> into<00:01:48.160> two

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
first we cut it vertically into two

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.320 
first we cut it vertically into two
equal<00:01:48.910> pieces<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:51.040> we<00:01:51.580> cut<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.880> chocolate

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
equal pieces here we cut the chocolate

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.760 
equal pieces here we cut the chocolate
into<00:01:52.920> halves<00:01:53.920> by<00:01:54.700> cutting<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.770> horizontally

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
into halves by cutting it horizontally

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.730 
into halves by cutting it horizontally
still<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:58.360> get<00:01:58.630> halves

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
still we get halves

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.930 
still we get halves
so<00:02:00.990> 1/2<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.470> another<00:02:03.370> half<00:02:03.730> make<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> hole<00:02:05.140> as

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
so 1/2 and another half make a hole as

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.450 
so 1/2 and another half make a hole as
we<00:02:06.940> saw<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.480> story<00:02:07.840> did<00:02:08.560> more<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.860> cut<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
we saw in the story did more to cut the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.490 
we saw in the story did more to cut the
cake<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:09.970> 2<00:02:10.360> equal<00:02:10.390> parts

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
cake into 2 equal parts

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.070 
cake into 2 equal parts
no<00:02:12.490> he<00:02:13.240> didn't

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
no he didn't

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.750 
no he didn't
these<00:02:14.830> are<00:02:15.130> not<00:02:15.490> halves<00:02:16.380> even<00:02:17.380> these<00:02:18.130> are<00:02:18.520> not

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
these are not halves even these are not

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.140 
these are not halves even these are not
halves<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.920> two<00:02:21.160> parts<00:02:21.580> are<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.910> equal

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
halves when the two parts are of equal

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500 
halves when the two parts are of equal
size<00:02:22.900> then<00:02:23.560> only<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.370> call<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.030> equal

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
size then only we can call the equal

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.760 
size then only we can call the equal
parts<00:02:25.960> halves<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.690> twins<00:02:28.990> had<00:02:29.440> themselves

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
parts halves if the twins had themselves

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.630 
parts halves if the twins had themselves
cut<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.730> cake<00:02:31.000> into<00:02:31.330> two<00:02:31.570> equal<00:02:32.350> parts<00:02:32.640> like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
cut the cake into two equal parts like

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.200 
cut the cake into two equal parts like
this<00:02:34.030> then<00:02:35.020> both<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.010> them<00:02:36.460> would<00:02:36.670> have<00:02:36.880> got<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
this then both of them would have got a

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.190 
this then both of them would have got a
half<00:02:37.750> part<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.500> equal<00:02:39.490> size<00:02:39.790> no<00:02:40.420> question<00:02:41.020> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
half part of equal size no question of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.640 
half part of equal size no question of
fighting<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.160> cake<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.760> right<00:02:43.650> but

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
fighting over the cake then right but

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.850 
fighting over the cake then right but
can<00:02:45.370> only<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> rectangle<00:02:46.690> or<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> circle<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.620> cut

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
can only a rectangle or a circle be cut

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.949 
can only a rectangle or a circle be cut
into<00:02:48.040> half<00:02:48.960> no<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.220> cut<00:02:51.460> many<00:02:51.880> shapes<00:02:52.390> into

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
into half no we can cut many shapes into

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.970 
into half no we can cut many shapes into
halves<00:02:54.120> there<00:02:55.120> are<00:02:55.390> different<00:02:55.870> shapes<00:02:56.170> but

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
halves there are different shapes but

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.550 
halves there are different shapes but
the<00:02:57.040> main<00:02:57.430> thing<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.660> part<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.260> whole

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
the main thing is that the part of whole

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.180 
the main thing is that the part of whole
object<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.370> called<00:03:00.670> half<00:03:01.060> only<00:03:01.840> when<00:03:02.530> both<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
object is called half only when both the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.210 
object is called half only when both the
parts<00:03:03.640> are<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.750> same<00:03:05.260> size

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
parts are of the same size

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.960 
parts are of the same size
now<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:08.260> if<00:03:08.470> they<00:03:08.709> were<00:03:08.770> three<00:03:09.370> children<00:03:09.820> to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
now what if they were three children to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.830 
now what if they were three children to
share<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.450> chocolate<00:03:10.959> bar<00:03:11.790> no<00:03:12.790> problem<00:03:13.540> we

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
share the chocolate bar no problem we

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.530 
share the chocolate bar no problem we
can<00:03:13.870> cut<00:03:14.440> into<00:03:15.040> three<00:03:15.550> equal<00:03:15.850> parts<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:17.530> this

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
can cut into three equal parts like this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.070 
can cut into three equal parts like this
here<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.380> three<00:03:20.620> parts<00:03:21.010> are<00:03:21.190> equal<00:03:22.180> when

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
here all the three parts are equal when

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.490 
here all the three parts are equal when
the<00:03:23.290> three<00:03:23.590> parts<00:03:24.040> are<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.400> same<00:03:24.730> size<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:26.200> call

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the three parts are of same size we call

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.620 
the three parts are of same size we call
the<00:03:26.709> equal<00:03:27.250> parts<00:03:27.820> thirds<00:03:29.130> we<00:03:30.130> write<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.519> as<00:03:30.730> 1

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the equal parts thirds we write it as 1

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.479 
the equal parts thirds we write it as 1
by<00:03:32.019> 3<00:03:32.470> as<00:03:33.300> one<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.540> cut<00:03:34.870> into<00:03:35.500> three<00:03:36.220> equal

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
by 3 as one is cut into three equal

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.430 
by 3 as one is cut into three equal
parts<00:03:37.350> see<00:03:38.610> 1<00:03:39.610> part<00:03:39.970> 2<00:03:40.300> part<00:03:40.660> 3<00:03:41.230> part<00:03:42.150> so

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
parts see 1 part 2 part 3 part so

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.780 
parts see 1 part 2 part 3 part so
one-third<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.390> three<00:03:47.050> parts<00:03:47.790> same

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
one-third is one of the three parts same

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.440 
one-third is one of the three parts same
way<00:03:49.120> if<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.989> cake<00:03:50.320> was<00:03:50.620> also<00:03:51.400> cut<00:03:51.670> into<00:03:52.180> three

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
way if the cake was also cut into three

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.009 
way if the cake was also cut into three
equal<00:03:52.690> parts<00:03:53.230> then<00:03:53.680> more<00:03:54.519> -<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.180> well<00:03:55.780> as<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
equal parts then more - as well as the

way in the case of cake - the twins

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.010 
way in the case of cake - the twins
could<00:05:27.640> have<00:05:27.850> cut<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.390> into<00:05:28.660> four<00:05:29.470> equal<00:05:29.500> parts

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
could have cut it into four equal parts

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.120 
could have cut it into four equal parts

so 1/4 for the mother now let us revise
what<00:05:54.580> we<00:05:54.610> understood<00:05:55.420> about<00:05:55.680> parts<00:05:56.940> what<00:05:57.940> part

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
what we understood about parts what part

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.350 
what we understood about parts what part
of<00:05:58.420> the<00:05:58.660> circle<00:05:59.140> is<00:05:59.290> coloured<00:05:59.770> there<00:06:00.700> are<00:06:01.000> 4

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
of the circle is coloured there are 4

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.570 
of the circle is coloured there are 4
parts<00:06:01.930> so<00:06:02.530> it<00:06:03.220> is<00:06:04.470> 1/4<00:06:05.470> part<00:06:05.830> of<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.250> whole

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
parts so it is 1/4 part of the whole

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.720 
parts so it is 1/4 part of the whole
which<00:06:07.030> is<00:06:07.270> colored<00:06:07.870> we<00:06:08.590> can<00:06:08.800> also<00:06:09.040> call<00:06:09.460> it<00:06:09.490> a

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
which is colored we can also call it a

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.920 
which is colored we can also call it a
quarter<00:06:10.950> here<00:06:12.000> 2<00:06:13.000> folds<00:06:13.900> are<00:06:14.490> colored<00:06:15.930> Hey

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
quarter here 2 folds are colored Hey

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.410 
quarter here 2 folds are colored Hey
look<00:06:18.150> 2/4<00:06:19.150> is<00:06:19.380> equal<00:06:20.380> to<00:06:20.710> 1/2<00:06:21.220> so<00:06:21.760> we<00:06:22.210> could

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
look 2/4 is equal to 1/2 so we could

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.690 
look 2/4 is equal to 1/2 so we could
also<00:06:22.630> call<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.170> 1/2<00:06:24.100> 1/2<00:06:25.030> is<00:06:25.300> equal<00:06:25.480> to<00:06:26.700> 2/4

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
also call it 1/2 1/2 is equal to 2/4

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.100 
also call it 1/2 1/2 is equal to 2/4
here<00:06:28.660> 3<00:06:29.320> parts<00:06:29.860> out<00:06:30.040> of<00:06:30.100> 4<00:06:30.730> parts<00:06:31.030> are<00:06:31.390> colored

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
here 3 parts out of 4 parts are colored

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:39.450 
here 3 parts out of 4 parts are colored
we<00:06:32.830> call<00:06:33.160> it<00:06:33.780> 3/4<00:06:34.780> or<00:06:36.030> 3/4<00:06:37.140> right<00:06:38.140> kids<00:06:38.500> here

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
we call it 3/4 or 3/4 right kids here

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.210 
we call it 3/4 or 3/4 right kids here
the

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
the

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.940 
the
Circle<00:06:40.610> has<00:06:40.850> three<00:06:41.270> equal<00:06:41.840> parts<00:06:42.110> that<00:06:42.710> is

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
Circle has three equal parts that is

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.810 
Circle has three equal parts that is
thirds<00:06:43.370> so<00:06:44.300> if<00:06:44.450> two<00:06:44.780> parts<00:06:45.260> are<00:06:45.470> colored<00:06:45.950> then

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
thirds so if two parts are colored then

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.030 
thirds so if two parts are colored then
we<00:06:47.540> call<00:06:47.900> two<00:06:48.500> thirds<00:06:49.070> are<00:06:49.430> colored<00:06:50.210> so<00:06:51.080> we

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
we call two thirds are colored so we

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.790 
we call two thirds are colored so we
have<00:06:52.340> learned<00:06:52.670> that<00:06:53.480> we<00:06:53.810> can<00:06:54.050> cut<00:06:54.290> a<00:06:54.320> whole

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
have learned that we can cut a whole

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.740 
have learned that we can cut a whole
object<00:06:55.640> into<00:06:56.480> many<00:06:56.810> parts<00:06:57.340> then<00:06:58.340> each<00:06:59.120> part<00:06:59.570> is

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
object into many parts then each part is

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.300 
object into many parts then each part is
called<00:07:00.170> a<00:07:00.580> fraction<00:07:01.580> that<00:07:02.420> was<00:07:02.690> all<00:07:02.960> for<00:07:03.230> today

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
called a fraction that was all for today

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.000 
called a fraction that was all for today
bye<00:07:04.310> bye<00:07:04.640> children
