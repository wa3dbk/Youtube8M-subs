00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
coverages that take that away and

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.560 
coverages that take that away and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
you know so you know part of that is

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.290 
you know so you know part of that is
getting<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.890> quarterback<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.340> be<00:03:06.610> disciplined
