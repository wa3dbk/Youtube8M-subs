head<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.210> opinion<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.020> not<00:02:16.200> enough<00:02:16.770> if

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
head in my opinion that's not enough if

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280 
head in my opinion that's not enough if
you<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.850> good<00:02:18.060> electrician<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.990> set

can see our roast is getting darker and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.150 
can see our roast is getting darker and
closer<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.540> what<00:04:19.720> we<00:04:19.930> would<00:04:20.140> like<00:04:20.350> which<00:04:20.950> is<00:04:21.130> a

full city roast whole city is where you

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.000 
full city roast whole city is where you
her<00:04:24.370> first<00:04:24.790> popcorn<00:04:25.390> crack<00:04:25.710> then<00:04:26.710> there'll<00:04:26.980> be

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
her first popcorn crack then there'll be

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.550 
her first popcorn crack then there'll be
a<00:04:27.130> minute<00:04:27.880> or<00:04:27.970> two<00:04:28.150> delay<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:29.440> you'll
