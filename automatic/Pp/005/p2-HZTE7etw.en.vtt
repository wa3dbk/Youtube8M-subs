 venice and Monaco and then if you have not noticed 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.650
 the name of the game is erbol but that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.420
 the mechanics of the game are focused on 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.070
 jumps that are made by ramps 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.780
 arranged on the track in which 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 You can make helicopters or turns of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.050
 barrel

 said jumps and the other pirouettes that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.660
 you do in the game are important then 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.280
 they will give you energy for your nitro what you 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.110
 will allow you to take more speed to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.400
 beat your opponents but something 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.869
 interesting is that you will not only have to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 Run your car to get there first 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 place 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 You must participate in other events such as 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.740
 for example rap is elimination in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.110
 where you must destroy a quantity of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 infection determined vehicles between 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.190
 others in each race or event you will receive 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.530
 a rating of one to five 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.540
 stars the first 3 stars are 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.580
 they unlock coming in first second 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 or third position while the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.030
 others are unlocked by completing 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 special objectives in each track as 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.940
 for example doing a certain 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.070
 number of barrel turns 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.530
 helicopters or destroying vehicles 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.390
 enemies but the stars are nothing 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.070
 these will allow you to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.350
 unlock more tracks and more seasons 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.180
 of the game equally at the tip of the pirouettes 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.740
 and achievements you can earn money in the game 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.890
 with which you can access more 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.300
 cars and buy improvements and if they 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 I say the truth, do not wait for absolutely 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.340
 nothing this game but it turned out to be 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.990
 amazing I was very surprised and now 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.550
 do not tell me to let me buy for the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 game blog people who 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.990
 contracted to make this review 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.940
 we need you to do a review of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.069
 our game you can talk all the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.890
 trash you want 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.329
 ok the graphics are very good in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.249
 special considering that it is a 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.139
 game for mobile devices and also 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:29.120
 the feeling of speed is very good 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.099
 achieved on the other hand something that left me 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.069
 surprised was the multiplayer mode via 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.840
 wifi or internet works quite well and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.700
 it is very entertaining to play against others 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.379
 human players the truth I thought that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.609
 was more likely to work 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.739
 my nintendo online that this thing but 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.150
 go to find out if it worked 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.249
 equally the races and events are 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.500
 very entertaining, increasing your challenge to a 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.939
 very good rhythm besides the fact of having 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.980
 to get stars to revisit 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.629
 more than once each level in order to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.730
 unlock all and keep moving forward 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.829
 in the game this in principle sounds 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.049
 quite boring but to me 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.370
 he kept quite entertaining something else 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.959
 what pleased me is that you can change the 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.219
 configuration of the controls for 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.989
 can place the commands in the 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.460
 screen and not have to depend on the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.350
 accelerometers of your device and avoid 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.350
 see you as a perfect imbecile 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900
 in addition to the ar style that the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.269
 game is very entertaining because 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 Let 's face it most games 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.939
 race simulators are like 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.610
 the game focuses on being fun 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.380
 above all 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.760
 for the bad side of course 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.590
 find the controls that being in 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.540
 screen 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.220
 they are not accurate enough and 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.360
 you will spend some time and exchanging 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.980
 paint against the barriers of 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.769
 containment of the track 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.349
 now he mentions that this game is 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.330
 Yes it is free you can download 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.650
 right now when the representative of 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.580
 gameloft told me it was a game 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.840
 freemium gave me a little distrust 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.150
 thinking that I would find a mode of payment 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 in a short time but the truth is that 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.110
 You can get more than 5 or 6 hours of 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.670
 game without having any problem 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.230
 yes, about half of the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.209
 third season you will start to stay 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.880
 short can not get cars what 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.410
 fast enough to compete 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.900
 Clear game will remind you that it is a lot 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.579
 easier to spend a little bit of money 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.280
 real life to harvest the money 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.959
 necessary to buy those cars in 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.150
 summary this game surprised me very 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.979
 positively it is very remarkable for 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.020
 be focused on mobile devices and 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.080
 being free is more entertaining and brings 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.080
 more hours of play than some others 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.080
 games 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.330
 so without a doubt I recommend 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:39.740
 much your game gives you a proven and if 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.719
 they like it because they can spend some 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.759
 real-life money supporting the 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.559
 developer to unlock cars and 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.569
 tracks and so on with the fun 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:50.529
 thank you very much for joining us and we 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.529
 we see in the next episode
