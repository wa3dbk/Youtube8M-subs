way to fill up so much credit he

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.259 
way to fill up so much credit he
basically<00:02:21.780> has<00:02:22.140> come<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:22.950> our<00:02:23.849> players

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
basically has come in and our players

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.360 
basically has come in and our players
are<00:02:24.780> getting<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:26.030> basically<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> role

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
are getting to basically I have a role

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.619 
are getting to basically I have a role
everybody<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> pressure<00:02:30.030> player<00:02:30.390> if

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
everybody can be a pressure player if

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.960 
everybody can be a pressure player if
they've<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:31.019> any<00:02:31.230> speed<00:02:31.890> or<00:02:32.189> any<00:02:32.370> will<00:02:32.640> at<00:02:32.849> all

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
they've got any speed or any will at all

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.750 
they've got any speed or any will at all
and<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:35.099> course<00:02:35.159> it's<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and so I think that of course it's a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.490 
and so I think that of course it's a
trite<00:02:36.060> thing<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> say<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:36.750> our<00:02:37.140> team<00:02:37.470> is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
trite thing to say but our team is

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
trite thing to say but our team is
playing<00:02:38.099> as<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> team<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.269> nice<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.659> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
playing as a team it's nice to have that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.449 
playing as a team it's nice to have that
quarterback<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.920> look<00:02:41.069> real<00:02:41.250> good

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
quarterback to that they look real good

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.229 
quarterback to that they look real good
