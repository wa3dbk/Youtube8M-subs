00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
off with number 40 captain Adam and the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
off with number 40 captain Adam and the
visible<00:00:46.980> beam<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> pack<00:00:51.050> as<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.140> point<00:00:52.379> out

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
visible beam in the pack as I point out

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720 
visible beam in the pack as I point out
the<00:00:52.739> only<00:00:52.890> 54<00:00:53.250> beans

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the only 54 beans

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
the only 54 beans
you<00:00:53.969> wouldn't<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.360> Commons<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.110> as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you wouldn't think Commons will go as as

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
you wouldn't think Commons will go as as
number<00:00:55.500> 40<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.489> possible<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:56.969> only

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
number 40 so it's possible there's only

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.479 
number 40 so it's possible there's only
one<00:00:57.420> rarity<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> set<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.340> won't
