 trapezoidal shape 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.339
 outboard type ailerons and flaps 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:03.839
 create aerodynamically imperfect 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.839
 double wing profile 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.979
 when lowering the flaps, the ailerons hang 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.689
 wing area 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:26.009
 that is 10.5 square meters lining just 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.560
 the wing is made of corrugated duralumin 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.760
 as well as tail sheathing 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:40.300

 pyramidal type highway 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.900
 the flight is not removed stand under the skin 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 closed fairings like them also not 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.500
 cleans up 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.490
 on the left side of the aircraft there is an entrance 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:16.260
 the door to the right of the aircraft is arranged 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 mooring cargo on the plane installed 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.500
 three star air engines 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.459

 digging engines and ravana 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.370
 under the hood of each motor are located 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:25.320
 moscow radiators screws 2 blade 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.320
 metal fixed pitch 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.050
 motor power fuel comes from 14 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.170
 nor the protected gas tanks 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:44.430
 located at 7 in each wing 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 with a total capacity of 2400 50 liters 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.830
 the front of the fuselage is equipped 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.830
 cockpit dual control 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.099
 front cockpit partition 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.340
 one side mounted installation 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:11.269
 radio compass 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:13.599
 and on the other hand transmitting 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.599
 radio station 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:28.419
 aircraft armament consists of three 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:29.570
 movable machine guns mg 15 caliber 7.92 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.440
 millimeter 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.100
 of which 2 are placed on bets in 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.600
 sides and in vain a third is installed 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.889
 above and for good reason 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:49.539
 there is no outdoor turret on the plane 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.539
 no armor 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.790
 empty aircraft weight 6500 kilograms 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:11.120
 normal flight weight is 10 thousand five hundred 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.850
 kilograms aerodynamically 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.930
 the imperfection is somehow corrugated 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.870
 plating is not a wing velocity profile and not 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.150
 retractable landing gear 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:31.340
 affects aircraft flight data 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.340
 aircraft run 340 meters 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.370
 near the altitude of the motors at height 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.220
 1400 meters 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:55.780
 the highest speed of the aircraft is 305 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:59.700
 kilometers per hour range at 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.920
 speed of 240 kilometers per hour at a height 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.680
 3000 meters 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.680
 reaches a thousand 400 kilometers 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.199
 currently the aircraft and the u-52 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:36.669
 used by the Germans mainly 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:38.550
 transport version of the quality of this 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:43.599
 obsolete aircraft 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:46.650
 his bottom and flight data are weak fire 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:52.199
 protection and the absence of any 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.470
 booking makes it easily vulnerable 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.479
 Remember 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:03.449
 the outline of the aircraft in the air 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:03.449
 vulnerabilities and boldly attack
