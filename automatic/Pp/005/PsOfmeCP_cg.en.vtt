00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good day dear friends 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.899
 perpetuum or alexander 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.980
 and my friend zizhechka cyber today and why 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.690
 I still record this video I want you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.530
 talk about two problems that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.139
 fed up 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.640
 Well, everyone can not everyone well, I like that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 exactly they are already fed up 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 the first problem is that i forget 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.220
 close the door behind you at night 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.390
 I go to my home j constantly zhuzhik 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.519
 I want to run away somewhere 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 get lost he wants no one to play with 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.329
 their elder brothers creepers but 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.399
 they are not all friendly to him 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 I don't have to save him all the time 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.540
 Of course I save him, but I also want 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.719
 sleep at night and not just go and look 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.300
 my friend is not the second problem is this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.800
 Imagine that you decide to stay in 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 his workshop to work on 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.129
 something 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.280
 and then you turn around and already see 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.890
 big creeper who already smelled 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020
 implodes this agree not quite 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.690
 nice of course you can leave 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 slabs to go through them and the door 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.580
 automatically after you shut down but 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.310
 the plates are of course somehow not cool 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.170
 better to use a solar battery 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.250
 high tech solar panel 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 let me demonstrate how she is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.890
 working right now we have the door day 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.409
 open as you can see 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 night comes on and the door automatically 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.880
 shut down and all because of the sun 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.340
 the battery also starts this one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
 incomprehensible mechanism why I built it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.049
 I will show you more precisely I will tell you a little later. 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.100
 let's first go back to our 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.500
 solar battery 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.740
 the fact is that when the light hits 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.890
 sunlight falls on this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.570
 plate it feeds the lines of redstone 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 a rockstone turn in turn 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.250
 powers the other elements here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
 all that she actually does 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 Of course, my fantasies were just enough 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 only on the door and on this piston 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 you will probably come up with something more 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.670
 interesting i'm sure now i'm 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 show how to craft this miracle 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 the solar battery is small 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 plate to craft us 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.700
 very few ingredients are needed 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.840
 specifically 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.800
 these are 5 pieces of red dust and 4 pieces 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.200
 iron ingot 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.860
 more precisely 4 iron bars you get 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.040
 here is such 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.690
 light sensor or light sensor 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 we put and at night when night falls he 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 stops feeding my 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.610
 redstone let's check it is not always 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.030
 the first time it works we turn on the night 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.819
 turn on the day now should power no 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 no yes sometimes she podglyuchivaet 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.630
 probably because the mod is a bit 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.670
 flawed not the first time she always 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.200
 earns well after a few 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.630
 manipulations all the same she starts 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.829
 work constantly look off 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 I turned on, I decided a little 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.459
 experiment and create this 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.190
 here is certainly controversial design but 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.110
 no less does it work when that's the opposite 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.110
 the light goes out 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 see it you might think too 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.239
 above it the light comes on it stops 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.819
 work it all depends on your imagination and 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.680
 your knowledge of redstone so guys 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.959
 experiment try yourself 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.610
 use a solar battery which 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 will work when hit on it 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.810
 light and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.709
 dare luck simon perpetuum buzz and 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.709
 to new meetings bye
