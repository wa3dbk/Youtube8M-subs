of different lenses you know you have a

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
of different lenses you know you have a
specific<00:00:17.130> lens<00:00:17.340> hood<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.090> lens<00:00:18.779> right

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
specific lens hood for this lens right

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.550 
specific lens hood for this lens right
over<00:00:19.260> here<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.970> specific<00:00:21.480> lens<00:00:22.289> hood

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
over here you have a specific lens hood

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.140 
over here you have a specific lens hood
with<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.400> over<00:00:23.670> here

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
with this over here

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
with this over here
and<00:00:24.689> let's<00:00:24.840> face<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.050> sometimes<00:00:25.650> these

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and let's face it sometimes these

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.089 
and let's face it sometimes these
wide-angle<00:00:26.460> lenses<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.570> pedal<00:00:27.900> hoods

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
wide-angle lenses have these pedal hoods

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.140 
wide-angle lenses have these pedal hoods
they<00:00:29.099> work<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.670> they're<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> greatest

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
they work but they're not the greatest

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
they work but they're not the greatest
hoods<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> very<00:00:32.369> wide<00:00:32.550> angle

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hoods because you have a very wide angle

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
hoods because you have a very wide angle
here<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.469> lenses<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
here and then you have some lenses that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
here and then you have some lenses that
don't<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.180> hoods<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.140> then

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
don't come with hoods at all and then

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
don't come with hoods at all and then
even<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.640> using<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.450> lens<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.320> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
even if you're using a lens like this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.200 
even if you're using a lens like this
one<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> comes<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> hood

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
one that comes with a hood

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540 
one that comes with a hood
sometimes<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.079> using<00:00:43.260> ND<00:00:43.829> filters<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
sometimes you're using ND filters and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.029 
sometimes you're using ND filters and
once<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> put<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> ND<00:00:45.360> filter<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.840> lens

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
once you put a ND filter on your lens

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
once you put a ND filter on your lens
then<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.520> can't<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.750> your

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
then you can't really use any of your

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.990 
then you can't really use any of your
hoods<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:51.090> compact<00:00:51.510> flag<00:00:51.809> system<00:00:52.230> here

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
hoods so this compact flag system here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.799 
hoods so this compact flag system here
offers<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> some<00:00:54.420> lens<00:00:55.110> shade<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:57.719> know

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
offers you some lens shade and you know

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.029 
offers you some lens shade and you know
it's<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.140> universal<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's pretty universal so only does is it

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
it's pretty universal so only does is it
sits<00:01:02.340> right<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.120> hot<00:01:03.449> shoe<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
sits right into your hot shoe see if I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
sits right into your hot shoe see if I
can<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.600> think<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
can get this in here I think it's this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
can get this in here I think it's this
way<00:01:09.530> there<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> don't

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
way there you go so that way you don't

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
way there you go so that way you don't
have<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> worry<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.259> your<00:01:16.500> lens<00:01:16.710> hoods<00:01:17.040> if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
have to worry about your lens hoods if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
have to worry about your lens hoods if
you<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.600> ND<00:01:19.320> filter<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you have this ND filter over here you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
you have this ND filter over here you
could<00:01:20.610> block<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.570> glare<00:01:21.750> from<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> Sun

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
could block the glare from the Sun

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.980 
could block the glare from the Sun
whichever<00:01:22.770> direction<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
whichever direction it's going and you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
whichever direction it's going and you
know<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> simple<00:01:25.590> solution<00:01:25.680> for

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
know it's a simple solution for

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.440 
know it's a simple solution for
traveling<00:01:26.520> light<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.180> swapping

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
traveling light and when you're swapping

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.780 
traveling light and when you're swapping
lenses<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> worry<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lenses you don't have to worry about the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.240 
lenses you don't have to worry about the
hoods<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
hoods that you're using or you know the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
hoods that you're using or you know the
ND<00:01:32.549> filter<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:33.060> gonna<00:01:33.180> cause<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> not

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
ND filter that's gonna cause you to not

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
ND filter that's gonna cause you to not
be<00:01:34.560> able<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> use<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> hood<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.670> yeah<00:01:36.540> check<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
be able to use the hood so yeah check it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960 
be able to use the hood so yeah check it
out<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> dinkum<00:01:37.799> compact<00:01:38.340> flag<00:01:38.549> system

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
out this is a dinkum compact flag system

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.100 
out this is a dinkum compact flag system
they<00:01:39.119> make<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.570> different<00:01:39.720> sizes

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
they make them in different sizes

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.920 
they make them in different sizes
depending<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.360> camera<00:01:42.780> you
