00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
like you'll forth through the corner you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.559 
like you'll forth through the corner you
start<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.830> roll<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.000> brilliant<00:01:51.420> just

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
start to roll into it so brilliant just

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.510 
start to roll into it so brilliant just
tough<00:01:51.750> picks<00:01:52.319> up<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> works<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> power

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
tough picks up it works into the power

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.499 
tough picks up it works into the power
nicely<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:55.020> EFI<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.159> much<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.090> starting

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
nicely the EFI not so much so starting

sitting inside this trellis frame here

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.770 
sitting inside this trellis frame here
you've<00:02:26.400> got<00:02:26.579> an<00:02:26.700> inline<00:02:27.030> four-cylinder

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
you've got an inline four-cylinder

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
engine pumping out 172 horses it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
engine pumping out 172 horses it's
really<00:02:30.180> strong<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.840> said<00:02:31.019> before<00:02:31.049> but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really strong like we said before but

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.910 
really strong like we said before but
the<00:02:32.190> power<00:02:32.870> engagement<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.959> kind<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.440> off<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
the power engagement is kind of off I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
the power engagement is kind of off I
mean<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.609> mapping<00:02:36.000> seems<00:02:36.299> like<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> needs

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
mean the mapping seems like it needs

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.590 
mean the mapping seems like it needs
some<00:02:37.109> fine-tuning<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.390> off

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
some fine-tuning because the on off

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.380 
some fine-tuning because the on off
throttle<00:02:39.959> especially<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:40.680> low<00:02:40.859> speeds<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
throttle especially at low speeds is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.900

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
front and in the rear so we've just

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
finished putting both these bikes

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.540 
finished putting both these bikes
through<00:03:56.140> their<00:03:56.260> paces<00:03:56.470> around<00:03:56.740> thunder<00:03:57.160> hill

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
front to rear and I think it was clear

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.800 
front to rear and I think it was clear
to<00:04:05.500> us<00:04:06.040> which<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:06.640> was<00:04:06.820> easier<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.300> ride<00:04:07.510> right

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
to us which one was easier to ride right

to us which one was easier to ride right
Tom<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.650> Aprilia<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.160> far<00:04:09.550> more<00:04:09.730> inviting

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
Tom the Aprilia is far more inviting

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.080 
Tom the Aprilia is far more inviting
both<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.530> us<00:04:11.650> took<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.040> few<00:04:12.280> laps<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.730> get<00:04:12.850> up<00:04:13.000> to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
both of us took a few laps to get up to

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.240 
both of us took a few laps to get up to
speed<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.630> MV<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.620> hard<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.950> fault<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
speed on the MV it's hard to fault the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.310 
speed on the MV it's hard to fault the
mechanical<00:04:15.760> components<00:04:16.270> of<00:04:16.450> either<00:04:16.989> one<00:04:17.230> of

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
mechanical components of either one of

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.100 
mechanical components of either one of
these<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.580> ride<00:04:18.760> one<00:04:19.120> quickly<00:04:19.510> the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
these but to ride one quickly the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.740 
these but to ride one quickly the
Aprilia<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.680> clearly<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.970> easier<00:04:22.300> one<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:22.630> do

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
Aprilia is clearly the easier one to do

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.190 
Aprilia is clearly the easier one to do
so

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
so

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.950 
so
a<00:04:23.400> big<00:04:24.400> technology<00:04:24.790> difference<00:04:25.450> at<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.840> know

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
a big technology difference at you know

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.230 
a big technology difference at you know
we<00:04:26.140> both<00:04:26.350> noticed<00:04:26.790> obviously<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.970> Aprilia

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
we both noticed obviously the Aprilia

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.690 
we both noticed obviously the Aprilia
has<00:04:28.450> a<00:04:28.480> quick<00:04:28.750> shifter<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:30.010> know<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.250> MP<00:04:30.490> does

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
has a quick shifter you know the MP does

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.300 
has a quick shifter you know the MP does
not<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.780> big<00:04:32.050> component<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.980> both<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.220> these

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
not so a big component to both of these

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.940 
not so a big component to both of these
bikes<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.090> traction<00:04:34.720> control<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.470> I

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
bikes is the traction control and I

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.440 
bikes is the traction control and I
think<00:04:36.070> Tom<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.700> had<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> couple<00:04:37.150> of<00:04:37.270> moments

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
think Tom you had a couple of moments

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.030 
think Tom you had a couple of moments
where<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.870> really<00:04:38.140> saw<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.680> difference

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
where you really saw a difference

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.520 
where you really saw a difference
between<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.310> two<00:04:39.490> yeah<00:04:40.330> absolutely<00:04:40.480> joy<00:04:40.960> you

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
between the two yeah absolutely joy you

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.770 
between the two yeah absolutely joy you
know<00:04:41.620> we<00:04:41.740> started<00:04:42.070> off<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.430> day<00:04:42.460> at<00:04:43.000> level<00:04:43.480> six

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
know we started off the day at level six

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.660 
know we started off the day at level six
and<00:04:44.080> we<00:04:44.530> brought<00:04:44.770> traction<00:04:45.250> Crowell<00:04:45.460> to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
and we brought traction Crowell to

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.340 
and we brought traction Crowell to
control<00:04:45.970> down<00:04:46.180> throughout<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.810> day<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
control down throughout the day just to

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.080 
control down throughout the day just to
kind<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.650> test<00:04:47.890> equally<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.550> see<00:04:48.730> you<00:04:48.970> know

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
kind of test equally to see you know

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.970 
kind of test equally to see you know
however<00:04:49.270> upped<00:04:49.630> it<00:04:49.720> was<00:04:49.900> how<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.290> engaged<00:04:50.650> and

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
however upped it was how it engaged and

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.610 
however upped it was how it engaged and
I<00:04:51.880> definitely<00:04:52.150> noticed<00:04:52.660> we<00:04:52.750> did<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:52.990> few<00:04:53.290> laps

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
I definitely noticed we did a few laps

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.320 
I definitely noticed we did a few laps
got<00:04:53.860> up<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.280> speed<00:04:54.520> a<00:04:54.550> little<00:04:54.670> bit<00:04:54.820> switched

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
got up to speed a little bit switched

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.500 
got up to speed a little bit switched
bikes<00:04:55.660> got<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.560> little<00:04:57.130> faster<00:04:57.580> on<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.910> MV<00:04:58.300> and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
bikes got a little faster on the MV and

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.380 
bikes got a little faster on the MV and
then<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.660> came<00:04:58.720> back<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.530> guy<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.390> it's

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
then I came back to this guy and it's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.900 
then I came back to this guy and it's
really<00:05:01.750> strange<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.350> mean<00:05:02.470> at<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.740> certain<00:05:02.910> lean

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
really strange I mean at a certain lean

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.060 
really strange I mean at a certain lean
angle<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.510> just<00:05:04.540> would<00:05:04.960> no<00:05:05.290> matter<00:05:05.410> how<00:05:05.950> much

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
angle it just would no matter how much

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.000 
angle it just would no matter how much
throttle<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.640> put<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.420> it<00:05:07.840> would<00:05:08.080> not<00:05:08.140> give<00:05:08.980> it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
throttle I put in it would not give it

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.070 
throttle I put in it would not give it
any<00:05:09.220> power<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.790> the<00:05:09.910> rear<00:05:10.060> wheel<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.600> then<00:05:10.960> as

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
any power to the rear wheel and then as

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.990 
any power to the rear wheel and then as
you<00:05:11.230> brought<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.770> up<00:05:11.860> past<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.520> certainly<00:05:12.880> an

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
you brought it up past a certainly an

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.850 
you brought it up past a certainly an
angle<00:05:13.270> all<00:05:13.390> sudden<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.140> engaged<00:05:14.620> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
angle all sudden it just engaged the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.830 
angle all sudden it just engaged the
power<00:05:15.040> and<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.520> was<00:05:15.640> very<00:05:15.880> disconcerting<00:05:16.330> for

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
power and it was very disconcerting for

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.640 
power and it was very disconcerting for
a<00:05:16.870> few<00:05:17.080> laps<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.490> MV<00:05:19.360> againt<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.110> same<00:05:20.350> higher

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
a few laps the MV againt the same higher

a few laps the MV againt the same higher
level

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280
