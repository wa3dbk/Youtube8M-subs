is<00:00:18.529> probably<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:19.890> new<00:00:20.039> favorite

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
is probably one of my new favorite

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.150 
is probably one of my new favorite
characters<00:00:20.880> because<00:00:21.510> she<00:00:22.080> has<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.590> primary

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
characters because she has a primary

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
characters because she has a primary
attack<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.119> unlike<00:00:24.600> anything<00:00:24.900> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
attack that is unlike anything that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
attack that is unlike anything that
we've<00:00:25.260> ever<00:00:25.470> seen<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.130> any<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> our<00:00:26.640> Skylanders

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we've ever seen in any of our Skylanders

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.929 
we've ever seen in any of our Skylanders
because<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.869> about<00:00:28.670> locomotion<00:00:29.670> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
because it's all about locomotion so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
because it's all about locomotion so
you'll<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.510> her<00:00:31.080> primary<00:00:31.320> attack<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
you'll see just her primary attack is

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.209 
you'll see just her primary attack is
actually<00:00:32.160> charging<00:00:33.000> horns<00:00:33.750> down<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.920> attack

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
actually charging horns down to attack

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.100 
actually charging horns down to attack
enemies<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.630> feels<00:00:36.899> completely

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
enemies and so it feels completely

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.590 
enemies and so it feels completely
different<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.920> you're<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.489> a

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
different because you're kind of like a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
different because you're kind of like a
train<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.290> know<00:00:40.410> running<00:00:40.710> toward<00:00:41.520> enemies

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
train you know running toward enemies

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940 
train you know running toward enemies
going<00:00:42.329> through<00:00:42.660> them<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.379> attack<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> then

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
going through them to attack and then

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
going through them to attack and then
you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.430> sweep<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.059> horns<00:00:45.390> up

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you can actually sweep your horns up

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
you can actually sweep your horns up
knocking<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.559> into<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> air<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.850> very

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
knocking them into the air so very

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
knocking them into the air so very
unique<00:00:48.420> really<00:00:48.870> fun<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> play<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.860> then

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
unique really fun to play as but then

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
unique really fun to play as but then
she's<00:00:50.250> also<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.760> these<00:00:51.239> hefty<00:00:51.600> stomps

she's also about these hefty stomps

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.080 
she's also about these hefty stomps

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
which you can do you can even do a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
which you can do you can even do a
jumping<00:00:54.539> stomp<00:00:54.870> attack<00:00:55.230> making<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> big<00:00:55.920> you
