what your finished first table will look

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.039 
what your finished first table will look
like<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> take

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
going to be using this as the base for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
going to be using this as the base for
our<00:01:39.780> new<00:01:40.259> table<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.829> you're<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.280> to

take your glue you're going to add it to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.149 
take your glue you're going to add it to
all<00:01:44.250> four<00:01:44.280> corners<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.259> top<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.040> the

all four corners of this top of the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
all four corners of this top of the
table<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> make<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.540> enough

because you're going to be sticking
together<00:01:50.130> press<00:01:50.490> wood<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> really<00:01:51.390> does

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
together press wood so it really does

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
together press wood so it really does
need<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.439> stick<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> top<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.790> take<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
need to stick to the top so take the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.429 
need to stick to the top so take the
table<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.899> together<00:01:55.020> and

and<00:01:59.160> you're<00:01:59.850> just<00:01:59.940> going<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.180> kind<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.390> push

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and you're just going to kind of push

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
and you're just going to kind of push
down<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.440> make<00:02:01.560> sure<00:02:01.740> it's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
down a little bit to make sure it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
down a little bit to make sure it's
secure<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.940> let<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> dry<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
few hours once the tables all dry I

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.410 
few hours once the tables all dry I
recommend<00:02:08.100> waiting<00:02:08.430> until<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:09.119> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

recommend waiting until you're just
about<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.750> add<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> nail<00:02:10.200> steps<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.710> remove

this protective sticker from the tables

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.860 
this protective sticker from the tables
it<00:02:13.680> will<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.950> prevent<00:02:14.340> any<00:02:14.550> scratches<00:02:15.270> from

it will just prevent any scratches from
occurring<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> table<00:02:16.860> while<00:02:17.070> you're

just going to kind of hold it up to
where<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.870> want<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.470> decorative<00:02:22.740> nail<00:02:23.040> trim

where you want the decorative nail trim

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920 
where you want the decorative nail trim
to<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.670> kind<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.120> measure<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.780> out

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
to be and just kind of measure it out

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
to be and just kind of measure it out
with<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.230> finger<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.490> part<00:02:26.700> is

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
with your finger and then this part is

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.880 
with your finger and then this part is
really<00:02:26.790> simple<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.480> bend<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.260> trim

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
really simple you just bend the trim

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.830 
really simple you just bend the trim
back<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> forth<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.760> eventually<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.810> just

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
back and forth and eventually it just

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840 
back and forth and eventually it just
breaks<00:02:31.350> apart<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.890> super<00:02:32.340> simple

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
breaks apart it's super simple

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.510 
breaks apart it's super simple
I<00:02:33.410> found<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.530> flipping<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.920> table<00:02:35.250> over<00:02:35.400> on

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
I found that flipping the table over on

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.430 
I found that flipping the table over on
its<00:02:35.790> side<00:02:35.850> makes<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> easier<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.750> work<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
its side makes it easier to work with so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.140 
its side makes it easier to work with so
I<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.800> took<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:37.950> nail<00:02:38.220> strip<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.700> already

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
I just took my nail strip that I already

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150 
I just took my nail strip that I already
measured<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.410> taped<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.770> down<00:02:40.830> that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
measured out and I taped it down that

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.040 
measured out and I taped it down that
way<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.430> easier<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.030> nail<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.870> nails

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
way it's easier to nail in the nails

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.449 
way it's easier to nail in the nails
with<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.320> hammer<00:02:43.530> you're<00:02:44.070> just<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
with the hammer you're just going to

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.490 
with the hammer you're just going to
take<00:02:44.640> your<00:02:44.820> hammer<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.209> add<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.900> nails<00:02:46.140> in

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
there's about one nail every four or

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770 
there's about one nail every four or
five<00:02:49.320> studs<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.100> add<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> table<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.660> you're

five studs to add to the table so you're

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.240 
five studs to add to the table so you're
just<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> repeat<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.590> process<00:02:52.650> until

just going to repeat this process until
you've<00:02:53.730> hammered<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.020> nails<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.500> your

you've hammered in all the nails on your
first<00:02:55.980> strip<00:02:56.340> for<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> table<00:02:57.180> just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
first strip for the table just

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.170

once you've repeated that same process

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.790 
once you've repeated that same process
for<00:03:01.210> all<00:03:01.360> four<00:03:01.750> sides<00:03:01.930> at<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.170> table<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
for all four sides at the table I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.980 
for all four sides at the table I
decided<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.700> wanted<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.150> go<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.840> add

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
decided that I wanted to go in and add

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.930 
decided that I wanted to go in and add
another<00:03:05.470> additional<00:03:06.040> outline<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.760> nail

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
another additional outline of the nail

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.090 
another additional outline of the nail
studs<00:03:07.270> on<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:08.050> front<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.410> tables<00:03:08.800> now

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
studs on the front of the tables now

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.620 
studs on the front of the tables now
this<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.400> completely<00:03:09.730> optional<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.360> can<00:03:10.480> do

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
this is completely optional you can do

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.630 
this is completely optional you can do
basically<00:03:11.110> any<00:03:11.380> type<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> design<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.490> you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
basically any type of design that you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.190 
basically any type of design that you
want<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.000> nail<00:03:13.240> strips<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:14.110> thought

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
want with the nail strips I just thought

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.830 
want with the nail strips I just thought
it<00:03:14.320> looked<00:03:14.350> better<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.880> double<00:03:16.300> rows<00:03:16.510> so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
it looked better with the double rows so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.880 
it looked better with the double rows so
that's<00:03:17.020> just<00:03:17.200> basically<00:03:17.560> what<00:03:17.770> I'm<00:03:17.860> doing

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
that's just basically what I'm doing

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.670 
that's just basically what I'm doing
here<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.510> process<00:03:19.900> basically<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.470> same

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
here the process basically it's the same

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.590 
here the process basically it's the same
for<00:03:20.920> all<00:03:21.070> four<00:03:21.370> sides<00:03:21.550> as<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.790> table<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.330> again

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
for all four sides as a table so again

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.090 
for all four sides as a table so again
you're<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:22.840> going<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.230> measure<00:03:23.410> out<00:03:23.740> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
you're just going to measure out the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.400 
you're just going to measure out the
piece<00:03:24.460> break<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.900> then<00:03:26.140> you're<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.350> to

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
piece break it and then you're going to

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.750 
piece break it and then you're going to
tape<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.770> down<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.250> then<00:03:27.340> you're<00:03:27.430> gonna<00:03:27.520> take

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
tape it down and then you're gonna take

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
tape it down and then you're gonna take
your<00:03:27.910> hammer<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.270> add<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.990> nail<00:03:29.140> studs<00:03:29.470> it's

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
your hammer and add the nail studs it's

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.230 
your hammer and add the nail studs it's
really<00:03:30.430> pretty<00:03:30.610> simple<00:03:31.060> you're<00:03:31.210> just

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
really pretty simple you're just

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.330 
really pretty simple you're just
repeating<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.720> same<00:03:31.810> process<00:03:32.380> over<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.160> over

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
repeating the same process over and over

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.000 
repeating the same process over and over
on<00:03:33.670> each<00:03:33.910> side<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.600> table<00:03:34.960> once<00:03:35.830> you're

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
on each side of the table once you're

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.190 
on each side of the table once you're
done<00:03:36.160> adding<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.910> aesthetic<00:03:37.600> trim<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
done adding the aesthetic trim to the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.960 
done adding the aesthetic trim to the
front<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.680> table<00:03:38.890> it's<00:03:39.280> basically<00:03:39.670> up<00:03:39.940> to

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
front of the table it's basically up to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.310 
front of the table it's basically up to
your<00:03:40.270> personal<00:03:40.630> preference<00:03:40.960> if<00:03:41.110> you'd<00:03:41.200> like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
your personal preference if you'd like

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.050 
your personal preference if you'd like
to<00:03:41.470> make<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.710> design<00:03:42.100> on<00:03:42.280> all<00:03:42.310> four<00:03:42.700> sides<00:03:42.730> at

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
to make this design on all four sides at

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.850 
to make this design on all four sides at
the<00:03:43.150> table<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.720> found<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> bit

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
the table I found it to be a bit

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.860 
the table I found it to be a bit
excessive<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.460> just<00:03:45.700> turn<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> side

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
excessive so I just turn it to the side

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.860 
excessive so I just turn it to the side
of<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.080> table<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.590> added<00:03:47.950> one<00:03:48.610> small<00:03:49.420> strip

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
of the table and I added one small strip

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.750 
of the table and I added one small strip
to<00:03:50.080> each<00:03:50.260> side<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> table<00:03:51.040> in<00:03:51.460> case

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
to each side of the table in case

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.640 
to each side of the table in case
someone<00:03:52.210> looks<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.660> from<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.900> side<00:03:53.110> angle<00:03:53.350> it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
someone looks at it from a side angle it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.110 
someone looks at it from a side angle it
still<00:03:53.980> looks<00:03:54.580> like<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.910> design<00:03:55.180> continues

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
still looks like the design continues

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.760 
still looks like the design continues
now<00:03:58.120> using<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.570> same<00:03:58.720> process<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.410> go<00:03:59.530> ahead

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
now using the same process just go ahead

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.370 
now using the same process just go ahead
and<00:04:00.130> add<00:04:00.340> those<00:04:00.550> two<00:04:01.060> final<00:04:01.570> strips<00:04:01.960> of<00:04:02.170> nail

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
and add those two final strips of nail

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.040 
and add those two final strips of nail
studs<00:04:02.710> and<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.370> all<00:04:03.580> done<00:04:03.900> here's<00:04:04.900> what

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
studs and you are all done here's what

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.570 
studs and you are all done here's what
your<00:04:05.200> finished<00:04:05.320> table<00:04:05.800> will<00:04:05.980> look<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.370> I

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
your finished table will look like I

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.610 
your finished table will look like I
