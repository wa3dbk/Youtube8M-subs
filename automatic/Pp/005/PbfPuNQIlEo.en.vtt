00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
all three of them up strength rotate one

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.729 
all three of them up strength rotate one
and<00:03:31.829> rotate<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.799> do<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> same<00:03:35.370> here<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and rotate to and do the same here the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.849 
and rotate to and do the same here the
strength<00:03:38.100> not<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.880> enable<00:03:41.060> rotate<00:03:42.060> strength

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
strength not to enable rotate strength

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.879 
strength not to enable rotate strength
and<00:03:44.090> all<00:03:45.090> three<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.359> them<00:03:45.599> okay<00:03:45.959> let's<00:03:46.590> move<00:03:46.739> it

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
eyebrow up and move the rotate one to

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.190 
eyebrow up and move the rotate one to
rotate<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:59.329> rotate<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.660> rotate<00:04:00.989> to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
rotate one and rotate to to rotate to

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.379 
rotate one and rotate to to rotate to
but<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.160> second<00:04:02.639> one<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.940> one<00:04:03.180> over<00:04:03.359> here

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389

you<00:04:04.319> move<00:04:04.799> rotate<00:04:05.639> one<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:06.060> rotate<00:04:06.419> to<00:04:06.690> and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
you move rotate one to rotate to and

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.879 
you move rotate one to rotate to and
rotate<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.519> rotate<00:04:08.880> one<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.959> let's<00:04:10.470> like

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
rotate to to rotate one so let's like

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.640 
rotate to to rotate one so let's like
opposite<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.700> now<00:04:12.690> we<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.959> everything<00:04:13.440> set
