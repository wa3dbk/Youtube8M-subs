combo this is very very simple all you
have<00:01:19.719> to<00:01:19.960> do<00:01:20.079> is<00:01:20.229> it's<00:01:20.799> like<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.280> flick

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
have to do is it's like you just flick

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.399 
have to do is it's like you just flick
the<00:01:21.850> joystick<00:01:22.329> in<00:01:22.509> any<00:01:22.719> direction<00:01:22.929> you<00:01:23.289> want

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
the joystick in any direction you want

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.029 
the joystick in any direction you want
don't<00:01:24.340> hold<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:25.240> flick<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.829> and<00:01:26.829> then

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
don't hold it just flick it and then

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.190 
don't hold it just flick it and then
right<00:01:27.219> after<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.640> press<00:01:27.909> attack<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.659> think<00:01:29.020> is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
right after that press attack I think is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.459 
right after that press attack I think is
circle<00:01:29.859> for<00:01:30.100> PlayStation<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:30.909> B<00:01:31.060> for<00:01:31.270> Xbox<00:01:31.659> so

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
circle for PlayStation and B for Xbox so

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.039 
circle for PlayStation and B for Xbox so
that's<00:01:32.799> all<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.039> have<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.310> do<00:01:33.429> to<00:01:34.149> perform<00:01:34.810> it

that's all you have to do to perform it
till<00:01:35.229> combo<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:35.859> all<00:01:36.159> we're<00:01:36.340> gonna<00:01:36.520> do<00:01:36.670> it

gonna learn by the end of this tutorial
how<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.719> do<00:02:04.899> it<00:02:05.020> much<00:02:05.200> faster<00:02:05.229> than<00:02:05.799> that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
how to do it much faster than that

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.550 
how to do it much faster than that
so<00:02:06.369> okay<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.569> now<00:02:07.719> let's<00:02:07.959> move<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.259> how<00:02:08.500> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
so okay so now let's move on and how to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.390 
so okay so now let's move on and how to
do<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.310> bit<00:02:09.490> faster<00:02:09.880> than<00:02:10.000> just<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:11.400> so

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
do this a bit faster than just that so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.490 
do this a bit faster than just that so
what<00:02:12.640> will<00:02:12.760> be<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.030> next<00:02:13.360> step<00:02:13.540> well<00:02:13.750> same

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
what will be the next step well same

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
what will be the next step well same
thing<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.830> I've<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.130> told<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.610> far<00:02:15.880> the

just try to get it so that you can just

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.330 
just try to get it so that you can just
kind<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:39.350> used<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.860> rhythm<00:02:40.070> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
kind of like get used to the rhythm of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.970 
kind of like get used to the rhythm of
two<00:02:40.850> until<00:02:41.120> combo<00:02:41.540> cancels<00:02:42.050> even<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:42.800> it's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
two until combo cancels even if it's

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.070 
two until combo cancels even if it's
slow<00:02:43.160> right<00:02:43.370> now<00:02:43.510> eventually<00:02:44.510> you'll<00:02:44.840> pick<00:02:45.050> it

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
slow right now eventually you'll pick it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.300 
slow right now eventually you'll pick it
up<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.470> you'll<00:02:45.590> be<00:02:45.620> able<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.190> much

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
up and you'll be able to do it much
