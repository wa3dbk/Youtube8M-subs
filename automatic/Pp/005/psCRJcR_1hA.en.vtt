00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
knife right here to help it along a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.000 
knife right here to help it along a
little<00:02:20.460> bit<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:22.110> really<00:02:22.350> does<00:02:22.590> slip<00:02:22.830> out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
little bit but it really does slip out

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.500 
little bit but it really does slip out
quite<00:02:23.370> nicely<00:02:23.690> own<00:02:25.040> there<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.160> go<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:27.090> at<00:02:27.330> this

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
quite nicely own there we go now at this

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.600
