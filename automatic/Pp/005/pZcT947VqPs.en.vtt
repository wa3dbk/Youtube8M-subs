once you marinate the chicken the next

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.400 
once you marinate the chicken the next
step<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.210> steam<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.780> we're<00:04:30.050> going<00:04:30.230> to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
step is to steam it and we're going to

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.350 
step is to steam it and we're going to
use<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.560> couscous<00:04:31.130> pot<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.730> steam<00:04:31.970> it<00:04:32.150> because

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
use a couscous pot to steam it because

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.090 
use a couscous pot to steam it because
it's<00:04:33.140> easy<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.530> if<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.830> don't<00:04:33.980> have<00:04:34.070> a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
it's easy and if you don't have a

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.950 
it's easy and if you don't have a
couscous<00:04:34.460> pot<00:04:34.640> just<00:04:34.970> use<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.420> steamer<00:04:35.690> you

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
couscous pot just use the steamer you

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.170 
couscous pot just use the steamer you
have<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.950> bottom<00:04:37.280> part<00:04:37.520> of<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.820> couscous

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
have in the bottom part of the couscous

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.020 
have in the bottom part of the couscous
pot<00:04:38.390> we're<00:04:38.630> going<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.930> add<00:04:39.020> hot<00:04:39.440> water<00:04:40.030> the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
pot we're going to add hot water the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.150 
pot we're going to add hot water the
reason<00:04:41.240> we<00:04:41.510> add<00:04:41.660> hot<00:04:41.930> water<00:04:41.960> is<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.740> minimize

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
reason we add hot water is to minimize

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.070 
reason we add hot water is to minimize
the<00:04:43.400> boiling<00:04:43.790> time<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.270> takes<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.690> boil<00:04:44.900> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the boiling time it takes to boil the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.470 
the boiling time it takes to boil the
water<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.740> goes<00:04:45.919> faster<00:04:46.460> I'm<00:04:46.700> also<00:04:47.210> going

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
water so it goes faster I'm also going

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.890 
water so it goes faster I'm also going
to<00:04:47.630> add<00:04:47.960> two<00:04:48.830> lemon<00:04:49.370> halves<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:50.000> there's<00:04:50.720> two

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
to add two lemon halves and there's two

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.020 
to add two lemon halves and there's two
reasons<00:04:51.110> why<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.470> do<00:04:51.650> that<00:04:51.919> first<00:04:52.280> when<00:04:52.940> you're

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
reasons why I do that first when you're

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.880 
reasons why I do that first when you're
just<00:04:53.300> boiling<00:04:53.570> water<00:04:53.930> without<00:04:54.260> ingredients

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
just boiling water without ingredients

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.790 
just boiling water without ingredients
in<00:04:55.040> your<00:04:55.160> couscous<00:04:55.550> pot<00:04:55.730> it<00:04:56.570> may<00:04:56.810> get<00:04:57.020> dark<00:04:57.410> so

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
in your couscous pot it may get dark so

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.310 
in your couscous pot it may get dark so
put<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.190> lemons<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.660> plot<00:04:59.870> doesn't<00:05:00.110> get

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
put the lemons so the plot doesn't get

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.110 
put the lemons so the plot doesn't get
dark<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.770> second<00:05:01.460> it<00:05:01.610> will<00:05:01.760> give<00:05:01.940> nice

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
dark and second it will give nice

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.380 
dark and second it will give nice
flavors<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.919> chicken<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.550> that's<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.180> so

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
flavors to the chicken and that's it so

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.030 
flavors to the chicken and that's it so
put<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:05.900> on<00:05:06.140> high<00:05:06.440> heat<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:08.710> cover<00:05:09.710> the
