this<00:00:11.420> project<00:00:11.809> is<00:00:11.930> huge<00:00:12.500> it's<00:00:13.190> one<00:00:13.309> of<00:00:13.400> the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
this project is huge it's one of the

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.949 
this project is huge it's one of the
most<00:00:13.639> comprehensive<00:00:13.969> dry<00:00:14.539> docks<00:00:14.750> we<00:00:14.870> have

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
most comprehensive dry docks we have

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.920 
most comprehensive dry docks we have
ever<00:00:15.080> done<00:00:15.230> so<00:00:15.950> we're<00:00:16.160> actually<00:00:16.910> touching<00:00:17.599> all

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
ever done so we're actually touching all

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.570 
ever done so we're actually touching all
of<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.140> space<00:00:18.380> on<00:00:18.560> board<00:00:18.740> there's<00:00:19.009> really<00:00:19.400> a

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
of the space on board there's really a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.850 
of the space on board there's really a
corner<00:00:19.939> we<00:00:20.060> leave<00:00:20.210> untouched<00:00:23.560> when<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:24.680> have<00:00:24.829> a

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
corner we leave untouched when we have a

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.400 
corner we leave untouched when we have a
ship<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.279> drydock<00:00:25.700> for<00:00:25.910> 30<00:00:26.119> days<00:00:26.359> it's<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.199> huge

ship in drydock for 30 days it's a huge

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.380 
ship in drydock for 30 days it's a huge
opportunity<00:00:27.710> for<00:00:28.070> us<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.369> really<00:00:28.849> take<00:00:28.970> care

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390

back in moving back aft but we take the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.289 
back in moving back aft but we take the
stern<00:01:15.320> thruster<00:01:15.740> completely<00:01:16.219> out<00:01:16.399> we<00:01:17.090> have<00:01:17.270> a

vessel<00:01:19.310> we're<00:01:20.030> putting<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.359> one<00:01:20.539> in<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.109> we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
vessel we're putting that one in so we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.130 
vessel we're putting that one in so we
do<00:01:21.469> that<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> rotational<00:01:22.399> basis<00:01:23.140> moving

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
do that on a rotational basis moving

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.169 
do that on a rotational basis moving
further<00:01:24.350> aft<00:01:24.649> we<00:01:25.280> have<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.579> propellers<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
further aft we have the propellers and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.179 
further aft we have the propellers and
the<00:01:26.270> rudders<00:01:26.600> we're<00:01:27.409> actually<00:01:27.560> doing<00:01:27.890> work<00:01:28.070> on

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
the rudders we're actually doing work on

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.039 
the rudders we're actually doing work on
the<00:01:28.249> rudder<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.880> replacing<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.600> propellers

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
the rudder and replacing the propellers

the rudder and replacing the propellers
completely<00:01:30.679> this<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.729> our<00:01:31.880> new<00:01:32.030> duck<00:01:32.539> tail

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
completely this is our new duck tail

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.539 
completely this is our new duck tail
this<00:01:33.380> has<00:01:33.560> been<00:01:33.770> put<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.310> several

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
this has been put on in several

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.639 
this has been put on in several
different<00:01:34.820> pieces<00:01:35.359> being<00:01:35.990> welded<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.619> the

stern of the vessel and the primary

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.179 
stern of the vessel and the primary
reason<00:01:38.960> for<00:01:38.990> putting<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.439> duck<00:01:39.619> tail<00:01:39.829> on<00:01:40.039> is

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
reason for putting the duck tail on is

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.120 
reason for putting the duck tail on is
to<00:01:40.399> improve<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.969> stability<00:01:41.179> of<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.749> vessel

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
to improve the stability of the vessel

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.380 
to improve the stability of the vessel
in<00:01:43.130> addition<00:01:43.549> there<00:01:43.759> since<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.210> have

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
in addition there since we have

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.529 
in addition there since we have
balconies<00:01:44.990> other<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.310> ship<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.240> bridge
