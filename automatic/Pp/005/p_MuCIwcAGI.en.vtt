about<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> packaging<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.500> would

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
about the packaging I think it would

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.320 
about the packaging I think it would
really<00:01:22.799> stand<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.700> these<00:01:24.060> bright

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
really stand out with these bright

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.700 
really stand out with these bright
colors<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.840> compared<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
colors on it compared to some of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
colors on it compared to some of the
other<00:01:25.799> foundations<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.759> collection<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.390> do

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
like the little squeezy bottles I think

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.649

that they're great because you can get

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
that they're great because you can get

afternoon and my skin has changed

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
afternoon and my skin has changed
dramatically<00:04:27.600> from<00:04:27.900> when<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.440> last<00:04:28.770> saw<00:04:29.100> it

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
dramatically from when you last saw it

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.250 
dramatically from when you last saw it
maybe<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:29.700> dramatically<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.020> can

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
maybe not dramatically but I can

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.770 
maybe not dramatically but I can
definitely<00:04:31.440> see<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:32.160> lot<00:04:32.400> of<00:04:32.430> oil<00:04:33.000> coming

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780

through<00:04:34.080> maybe<00:04:34.680> not<00:04:34.800> oil<00:04:35.040> but<00:04:35.310> definitely

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
through maybe not oil but definitely

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.610 
through maybe not oil but definitely
looks<00:04:36.270> shiny<00:04:36.600> maybe<00:04:36.960> there's<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.380> senton

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
finish of the foundation but definitely

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.909 
finish of the foundation but definitely

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
around my t-zone area that has just come

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.130 
around my t-zone area that has just come
through<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.820> did<00:04:45.150> kind<00:04:45.390> of<00:04:45.450> have<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.660> little<00:04:45.930> bit

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
through I did kind of have a little bit

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.990 
through I did kind of have a little bit
of<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.290> lay<00:04:46.530> down<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.160> I<00:04:47.280> was<00:04:47.370> mainly<00:04:47.580> laying<00:04:47.850> on

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
of a lay down and I was mainly laying on

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.300 
of a lay down and I was mainly laying on
this<00:04:48.210> side<00:04:48.480> but<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.440> doesn't<00:04:49.860> really<00:04:50.070> look

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
this side but it doesn't really look

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.400 
this side but it doesn't really look
like<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:51.120> transferred<00:04:51.750> which<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.200> good

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
like it's transferred which is a good

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.530 
like it's transferred which is a good
thing<00:04:52.470> there<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.550> bit<00:04:53.850> here<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.360> looks

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
thing there is this bit here that looks

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.370 
thing there is this bit here that looks
really<00:04:55.080> really<00:04:55.290> funny<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.860> don't<00:04:56.490> know<00:04:56.669> why<00:04:56.880> but

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
really really funny I don't know why but

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.159 
really really funny I don't know why but
it<00:04:58.380> did<00:04:58.560> look<00:04:58.590> funny<00:04:58.950> before<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.490> went<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169

Trent<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.770> is<00:05:02.100> definitely<00:05:03.020> transferring<00:05:04.220> on

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
Trent it is definitely transferring on

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.450 
Trent it is definitely transferring on
my<00:05:05.490> finger<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.300> see<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:07.200> there<00:05:07.560> I'm<00:05:08.250> not

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460

really that big of a fan of it fit some
of<00:05:10.710> my<00:05:10.800> other<00:05:11.010> foundations<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:11.820> know<00:05:12.000> they<00:05:12.570> have

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.020 
of my other foundations I know they have
great<00:05:13.200> coverage<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:14.010> they<00:05:14.400> last<00:05:14.669> a<00:05:14.820> long<00:05:14.850> time

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
great coverage and they last a long time

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.990 
great coverage and they last a long time
this<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:15.900> did<00:05:16.169> have<00:05:16.350> good<00:05:16.590> coverage<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.400> I

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
this one did have good coverage and I

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.240 
this one did have good coverage and I
set<00:05:18.210> up<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.419> my<00:05:18.540> normal<00:05:18.870> powder<00:05:19.140> I<00:05:19.680> said

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
set up with my normal powder I said

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.969 
set up with my normal powder I said
everything<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:20.790> normal<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:22.200> just<00:05:22.500> hasn't

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
everything is normal and it just hasn't

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.490 
everything is normal and it just hasn't
really<00:05:23.430> given<00:05:24.000> me<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.419> long<00:05:24.690> lasting<00:05:25.169> effect

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
really given me that long lasting effect

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.830 
really given me that long lasting effect
nothing<00:05:25.950> it<00:05:26.040> claims<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.460> be<00:05:26.550> long<00:05:26.790> lasting<00:05:27.000> but

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
nothing it claims to be long lasting but

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840 
nothing it claims to be long lasting but
I<00:05:28.020> did<00:05:28.350> expect<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.860> little<00:05:29.190> bit<00:05:29.310> longer<00:05:29.580> than

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
I did expect a little bit longer than

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.820 
I did expect a little bit longer than
this<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.360> guess<00:05:30.570> right<00:05:31.050> now<00:05:31.110> would<00:05:31.470> be<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:31.800> a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
this I guess right now would be like a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.000 
this I guess right now would be like a
days<00:05:32.250> where<00:05:32.970> of<00:05:33.330> makeup<00:05:33.930> overall<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.680> probably

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
days where of makeup overall I probably

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.250 
days where of makeup overall I probably
won't<00:05:35.640> be<00:05:35.880> wearing<00:05:36.030> this<00:05:36.240> one<00:05:36.450> as<00:05:36.630> much<00:05:36.810> as<00:05:37.080> my

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
won't be wearing this one as much as my

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.080 
won't be wearing this one as much as my
other<00:05:37.470> ones<00:05:37.770> especially<00:05:38.250> because<00:05:38.790> I<00:05:38.820> have

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
other ones especially because I have

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.360 
other ones especially because I have
ones<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.510> do<00:05:39.840> stay<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.290> lot<00:05:40.650> better<00:05:40.890> if<00:05:41.250> I

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
ones that do stay on a lot better if I

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.650 
ones that do stay on a lot better if I
was<00:05:41.490> going<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.760> wear<00:05:41.910> this<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.120> would<00:05:42.450> take<00:05:42.630> a

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
was going to wear this I would take a

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.750 
was going to wear this I would take a
powder<00:05:42.930> with<00:05:43.260> me<00:05:43.410> so<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.590> can<00:05:43.830> touch<00:05:44.040> up<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:44.550> I

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
powder with me so I can touch up and I

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.850 
powder with me so I can touch up and I
actually<00:05:45.090> will<00:05:45.570> touch<00:05:46.050> up<00:05:46.260> one<00:05:46.470> side<00:05:46.680> of<00:05:46.710> my

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
actually will touch up one side of my

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.790 
actually will touch up one side of my
face<00:05:47.180> I'll<00:05:48.180> touch<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.690> side<00:05:48.960> up<00:05:49.140> I<00:05:49.350> also

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
face I'll touch this side up I also

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.830 
face I'll touch this side up I also
noticed<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.370> my<00:05:50.700> mascara<00:05:51.060> has<00:05:51.300> transferred

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
noticed that my mascara has transferred

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.010 
noticed that my mascara has transferred
their<00:05:52.169> which<00:05:52.950> doesn't<00:05:52.979> usually<00:05:53.880> happen<00:05:54.330> I

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
their which doesn't usually happen I

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.650 
their which doesn't usually happen I
think<00:05:55.350> I<00:05:55.470> was<00:05:55.650> using<00:05:55.979> a<00:05:56.190> waterproof<00:05:56.729> one<00:05:56.970> but

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
think I was using a waterproof one but

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.930 
think I was using a waterproof one but
one<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.110> I<00:05:58.410> might<00:05:59.070> have<00:05:59.250> dipped<00:05:59.520> in<00:05:59.669> a<00:05:59.760> non

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
one that I might have dipped in a non

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.670 
one that I might have dipped in a non
waterproof<00:06:00.210> mascara<00:06:00.690> that<00:06:01.080> makes<00:06:01.470> sense

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
waterproof mascara that makes sense

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.900 
waterproof mascara that makes sense
there's<00:06:02.130> definitely<00:06:02.610> made<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:02.820> difference

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
there's definitely made a difference

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.460 
there's definitely made a difference
touching<00:06:03.600> up<00:06:03.660> this<00:06:03.870> side<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.200> my<00:06:04.289> face

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
touching up this side of my face

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.350 
touching up this side of my face
compared<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.250> side<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.520> can<00:06:05.789> still<00:06:06.060> set

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
compared to this side you can still set

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.440 
compared to this side you can still set
definitely<00:06:06.990> see<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.200> oil<00:06:07.470> there<00:06:08.370> I'm<00:06:08.910> peeping
