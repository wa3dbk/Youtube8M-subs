power puncher but if Algeria gets that

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.760 
power puncher but if Algeria gets that
set<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.480> tone<00:06:27.630> off<00:06:27.840> it<00:06:28.020> was<00:06:28.110> off<00:06:28.410> his<00:06:28.500> length

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
set the tone off it was off his length

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.700 
set the tone off it was off his length
with<00:06:28.980> big<00:06:29.160> shots<00:06:29.430> were<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.570> mere<00:06:31.080> can't<00:06:31.350> get<00:06:31.530> off

with big shots were a mere can't get off
with<00:06:32.040> that<00:06:32.220> speed<00:06:32.550> which<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.320> don't<00:06:34.320> see

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
with that speed which I don't see

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.220 
with that speed which I don't see
happening<00:06:35.100> I<00:06:35.510> think<00:06:36.510> it<00:06:36.660> could<00:06:36.840> be<00:06:36.990> an<00:06:37.080> issue

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
happening I think it could be an issue

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.400 
happening I think it could be an issue
but<00:06:37.470> at<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.830> same<00:06:38.070> time<00:06:38.370> he<00:06:38.970> fires<00:06:39.420> so<00:06:39.750> much<00:06:40.020> so

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
but at the same time he fires so much so

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.790 
but at the same time he fires so much so
quick<00:06:40.740> so<00:06:41.070> fast<00:06:41.840> so<00:06:42.840> relentless<00:06:43.470> when<00:06:43.680> he's

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
quick so fast so relentless when he's

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.170 
quick so fast so relentless when he's
getting<00:06:43.950> offered<00:06:44.430> shots<00:06:44.670> that<00:06:44.820> I<00:06:44.850> think<00:06:45.090> it's

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
getting offered shots that I think it's

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.880 
getting offered shots that I think it's
gonna<00:06:45.270> be<00:06:45.450> a<00:06:45.480> problem<00:06:45.810> for<00:06:45.990> LG<00:06:46.380> Justice<00:06:46.710> said

of<00:07:18.470> exchanging<00:07:19.470> with<00:07:19.560> guys<00:07:19.800> I<00:07:20.600> think<00:07:21.600> with

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
of exchanging with guys I think with

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.950 
of exchanging with guys I think with
this<00:07:22.050> fight<00:07:22.880> and<00:07:23.880> you<00:07:24.030> have<00:07:24.210> to<00:07:24.420> respect<00:07:24.540> every

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
this fight and you have to respect every

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.650 
this fight and you have to respect every
fighter<00:07:25.200> in<00:07:25.410> the<00:07:25.500> game<00:07:25.740> but<00:07:26.340> I<00:07:26.400> think<00:07:26.790> a<00:07:27.090> mere

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 
fighter in the game but I think a mere

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.900 
fighter in the game but I think a mere
knows<00:07:27.990> that<00:07:28.290> he's<00:07:28.410> not<00:07:28.620> in<00:07:28.830> with<00:07:29.040> a<00:07:29.070> big<00:07:29.400> banger

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
knows that he's not in with a big banger

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.360 
knows that he's not in with a big banger
he's<00:07:30.360> not<00:07:30.570> in<00:07:30.750> with<00:07:30.870> a<00:07:30.900> big<00:07:31.170> puncher<00:07:31.620> why<00:07:32.100> he

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
he's not in with a big puncher why he

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.680 
he's not in with a big puncher why he
and<00:07:32.550> he's<00:07:32.700> fighting<00:07:33.030> at<00:07:33.120> a<00:07:33.150> heavier<00:07:33.510> weight

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
and he's fighting at a heavier weight

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.780 
and he's fighting at a heavier weight
class<00:07:34.020> why<00:07:34.650> he<00:07:34.830> might<00:07:34.980> take<00:07:35.250> that<00:07:35.460> risk<00:07:35.640> to

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:35.790 
class why he might take that risk to

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.550 
class why he might take that risk to
just<00:07:36.000> keep<00:07:36.150> working<00:07:36.630> through<00:07:36.840> it<00:07:36.960> and<00:07:37.110> not

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
just keep working through it and not

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.440 
just keep working through it and not
really<00:07:37.830> feel<00:07:38.100> so<00:07:38.340> intimidated<00:07:38.610> by<00:07:39.120> getting
