00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
this color bar here and we see we we

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710 
this color bar here and we see we we
have<00:03:04.430> white<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.790> top<00:03:05.030> we<00:03:05.239> want<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.480> put<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
with the blacks on top it does the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.350 
with the blacks on top it does the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
opposite so now our eraser is actually

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.009 
opposite so now our eraser is actually
erasing<00:03:12.310> our<00:03:13.310> color<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.570> we<00:03:14.780> made<00:03:14.989> a

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019
