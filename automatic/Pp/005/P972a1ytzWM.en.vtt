00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.130
 About the position of the ball 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.890
 Because the position of the ball still puts the club in the middle of the body 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.130
 The ball is near the left foot 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.280
 Which club sand wedge is around here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:23.700
 farewell and forehead 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.930
 Not struck by the front of the body Te body golf and say I hope what big to be in the vicinity of the heel 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.110
 Don't 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.430
 But the body 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:40.450
 Turning from right to left has a slight center of gravity but right 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:42.630
 In qi it is moving by turning the body a little to the left 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.480
 So the real 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:54.600
 The front of the body at the time of impact is a little bit more left than it was at the address . 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.810
 Since it will be in the line in the vicinity of the heel also left left little body as a neutral position 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 By putting the ball 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.350
 The club is in front of the steel shell 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 Toka put you in the situation say the strike so the original right 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.380
 Is an application 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 Short of a say Toka right 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:22.619
 Because it is used in the situation of hitting the public cheap and easy or low ball here, basically 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 Is said to hit and spin on this left without being placed too much to the right and down in a racetrack etc. 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.370
 It will be important to put a practice window on the practice ground and put it on the right , even with crossed movements 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.870
 To some extent everything on mat 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.310
 Because there will so often slip in the mat of Omojo 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.670
 not really 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.570
 It's going to be a simple and difficult story, but if you're slipping on the left you're on the grass 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.110
 To some extent 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 I will slide 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.020
 People are threads thanks to the mat by knocked at the right is stuck with smoked is go on the lawn 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.539
 I will not proceed 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.439
 As for the person who is turning to say the left and the course club is slipping, it is the same as going to the course 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.240
 A little 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.300
 Even if you get into the dreadiness 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.960
 With the opening of the ball 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.680
 Basic in some of us carry the club 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.110
 The left side of the N Kakyu that neutral place position is a little body 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.700
 In terms of location left heel also the vicinity of 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.210
 It was a story that it was natural to put the ball around 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.600
