00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.710
 Dear Internet users in your born seat 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.710
 sports with 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.279
 because here is going to talk about something else 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.439
 complicated than having a diarrhea 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.259
 caused by drinking sewage in the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.480
 Mexico City I will explain how 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.180
 the rise and fall in 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.770
 the first division of Mexican soccer 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.019
 that I think is like in Spain or 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.140
 england where the two descend 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:38.050
 worst teams of the season not that 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.000
 only compared to a puppy with all 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.570
 the shit that is a soccer tournament 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.190
 Mexican although for sporting merits 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.190
 descended the querétaro and ascended the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.010
 pity the league mx I show that it is a 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.559
 league of shit it turns out that the jaguars 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.769
 de chiapas sold its franchise in chalk 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.430
 San Luis to veneers and piety 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.790
 recently promoted veracruz where indicated 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.070
 Desmadre and Maria is already decided with order 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.320
 it does not cease to exist they say that godliness 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.140
 had no space required for 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 first division 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.430
 because it's not going to compete for you 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.860
 rise with these changes is as if the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.210
 querétaro no 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.070
 and those who bought their place in the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.530
 first division were the sharks 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.840
 veracruz reds how sad that the 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.910
 shadows comprise the table what is not 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 can achieve on the soccer fields 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.500
 it's a mockery for fans 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.660
 queretans that ended at the end of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.320
 tournament to see their cocks without know how 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.750
 as how as a cousin stands out when you 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.610
 pay to the toilet last week 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.650
 They said they were going to change the logo to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.920
 wants to be by putting an orange color 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.290
 to the bows and 15 that gays taxi 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.990
 to justify you is the jaguars and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.330

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.310

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.430

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.440
 pumas some eagles of eagles to kaka 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.330
 It makes you amazing that if you buy in 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.450
 Mexican soccer franchises like 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.789
 as if they were one to the oxxo where it is 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.130
 the sporting spirit already said it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.700
 junkie junkie maradona the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.710
 What cheering ball does not stain me? 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 I tell the owners of the equipment in me 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.130

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.230
