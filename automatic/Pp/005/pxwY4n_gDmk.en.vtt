00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.170
 Oh 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.860
 hello to all today I resume 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.320
 the series of motorcycle luc presentations 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.930
 apollo motors has released a new motorcycle 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 who is there and then red dead on the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 photo is a 125 poppen peace is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.629
 very important because there are two classes there 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.220
 are the open class and the class and the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.489
 explain that a little later in the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.260
 city 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.180
 so let's start from the beginning 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
 obviously apollo came off the heavy with 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 their new and renzan compete with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.450
 their direct competitors there is so 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.610
 I started with the designed frame 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.960
 especially for rays that guarantees 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.160
 stability and better 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.720
 performance in a trajectory 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.970
 it is associated with a swingarm in 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.890
 reinforced steel we find at the front the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.780
 volts suspensions on open models 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.260
 and the volte 2 on the elite models 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.580
 they are the same size in usd 770 mm 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.370
 the difference is on the diameter 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.520
 which is 33 in diameter for bolt 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.190
 one and 38 for the volts two at the back 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.690
 no difference is 35 mm 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 diameter 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.470
 Unlike open models and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.480
 elite models is found on the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.310
 suspensions suspensions your moon 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.290
 that equip open models are only 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.000
 not adjustable unlike volts 2 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.710
 where we find on elite models 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.660
 which they are adjustable in relaxation 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.860
 talk about but talking about engine that's 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590
 for no improvement we are 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.150
 always on engines y ips 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.120
 four-stroke single cylinder it exists 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.740
 in displacement from 125 to 150 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.170
 always with four speeds they are 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.830
