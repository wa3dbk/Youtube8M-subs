open now that I have my image on stage

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
open now that I have my image on stage
i'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> rename<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.180> layer<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.899> i<00:00:39.930> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
i'm going to rename the layer so i can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.819 
i'm going to rename the layer so i can
keep<00:00:40.260> organized<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> content<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> double

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
keep organized all the content so double

keep organized all the content so double
click<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.190> layer<00:00:44.250> 1<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.230> rename

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
click on layer 1 and then i can rename

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.720 
click on layer 1 and then i can rename
this<00:00:46.829> layer<00:00:46.910> let's<00:00:47.910> name<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.239> image<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.829> then

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
this layer let's name it image and then

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.770 
this layer let's name it image and then
press<00:00:51.090> enter<00:00:52.610> now<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.969> create<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.300> new<00:00:54.360> layer

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
press enter now I can create a new layer

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.240 
press enter now I can create a new layer
for<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> mask<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> go<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.469> new<00:00:59.190> layer<00:00:59.430> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
for the mask so I go to new layer and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
for the mask so I go to new layer and
once<00:01:02.250> again<00:01:02.430> let's<00:01:02.940> name<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.480> layer<00:01:03.719> number

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
once again let's name this layer number

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.600 
once again let's name this layer number
to<00:01:06.020> double<00:01:07.020> click<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> let's<00:01:08.100> name<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to double click and let's name in the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
to double click and let's name in the
mask<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> press<00:01:11.100> Enter<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> use<00:01:15.330> shapes

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
mask and press Enter you can use shapes

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
mask and press Enter you can use shapes
text<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> symbols<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.369> create<00:01:20.640> mask

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
text and all the symbols to create mask

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880 
text and all the symbols to create mask
but<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.630> tutorial<00:01:21.689> i<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.470> using<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
but for this tutorial i will be using a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
but for this tutorial i will be using a
shape<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> i'm<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> draw<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.290> novel

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
shape and i'm going to draw up a novel

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.149 
shape and i'm going to draw up a novel
so<00:01:26.520> from<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> panels<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.829> i'm<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so from the panels to i'm going to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.719 
so from the panels to i'm going to
select<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.549> Oval<00:01:29.880> tool<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:31.520> making<00:01:32.520> sure

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
select the Oval tool and making sure

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.600 
select the Oval tool and making sure
that<00:01:32.939> I'm<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> mask<00:01:34.110> layer<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.340> start

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that I'm in the mask layer I can start

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.020 
that I'm in the mask layer I can start
to<00:01:35.790> draw

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.470 

ok

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.710 

now<00:01:45.110> that<00:01:45.320> I'm<00:01:45.440> happy<00:01:45.680> with<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.220> shape<00:01:46.580> then<00:01:47.480> i

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
now that I'm happy with the shape then i

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.620 
now that I'm happy with the shape then i
can<00:01:47.930> create<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:49.430> mask<00:01:51.910> so<00:01:52.910> right<00:01:53.210> click<00:01:53.390> on

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
can create the mask so right click on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.320 
can create the mask so right click on
the<00:01:53.750> mask<00:01:54.020> layer<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.120> then<00:01:56.120> click<00:01:57.050> on<00:01:57.200> mask

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.900 

okay<00:02:02.330> as<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.200> see<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.950> layer<00:02:04.190> icon<00:02:04.460> has

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
okay as you can see the layer icon has

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.690 
okay as you can see the layer icon has
changed<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.570> a<00:02:05.600> mask<00:02:05.870> layer<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.490> layer

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
changed to a mask layer and the layer

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.480 
changed to a mask layer and the layer
that<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.119> being<00:02:08.360> masked<00:02:08.920> which<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> image

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
that it's being masked which is a image

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.200 
that it's being masked which is a image
is<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.880> indented<00:02:12.580> now<00:02:13.580> if<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:13.970> some<00:02:14.000> reason

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
is now indented now if for some reason

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.680 
is now indented now if for some reason
you<00:02:14.570> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.960> change<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> size<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.100> mask

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
you want to change the size of the mask

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.760 
you want to change the size of the mask
just<00:02:17.690> make<00:02:17.840> sure<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.050> unlock<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.160> mask<00:02:19.430> layer

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
just make sure to unlock the mask layer

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.130 
just make sure to unlock the mask layer
so<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.830> will<00:02:22.070> be<00:02:22.100> able<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.550> modify<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.780> shape

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.720 

or<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.800> can<00:02:27.980> even<00:02:28.100> add<00:02:28.430> more<00:02:29.330> shapes

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.190 

so<00:02:38.300> once<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.870> done<00:02:39.310> any<00:02:40.310> change<00:02:44.200> just

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
so once you have done any change just

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.699 
so once you have done any change just
make<00:02:45.349> sure<00:02:45.379> to<00:02:45.530> log<00:02:46.340> again<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.120> mask<00:02:47.420> layer<00:02:47.750> so

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
make sure to log again the mask layer so

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.710 
make sure to log again the mask layer so
you<00:02:48.769> will<00:02:49.069> be<00:02:49.220> able<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.580> see<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.480> changes

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
you will be able to see the changes
