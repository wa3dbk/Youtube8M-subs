00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 it was a moment of waiting but at ten in the morning 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.859
 at half past ten the players came to 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.160
 outside except dzsudzsak and ballast 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.210

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.580
 of bass roorda approved there are one 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.580
 meeting held 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 and phillip cocu and also jan wouters de 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.800
 have training programs outfit 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 can really be started first with 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 the usual 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.059
 bleeding and while the players' 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 walk the eggs here 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.930
 probably for a big one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.930
 birthday cake for edison mendez 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.730
 the well-known rondo follows after the warm-up 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 here with yesterday's basic players 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.989
 and on the other hand the spare players 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.989
 and this is a little more fanatic 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
 hold the first games after less than an hour 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 as seen before 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 Carlos Salcido enters the net 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 such as andreas isaacson 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.790
 That does not apply to the players who 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.000
 no yesterday and they made 90 minutes 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.920
 could enjoy this finish 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.869
 laying out is from your parents and it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.430
 shot the goal in this case from 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.700
 danny koevermans 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 also sees colleague striker ola toivonen 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.030
 timmy simons is still busy 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:39.009
 with the discussion of feyenoord and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.009
 lacks this second finish 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.920
 this time from danny 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.869
 koevermans and the goal of nordin 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.110
 Amrabat did not join the parties yesterday 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.360
 but because of a suspension, the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.090
 yesterday's base eleven definitively to 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.130
 inside and the remaining eight still working 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.390
 a game on a small field 4 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.610
 against 4 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.959
 it remained the same for a long time but it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.970
 winning goal was eventually 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:11.030
 made by none other than 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.620
 phillip cocu for the supporters is the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.620
 solution is therefore simple 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.970
 ok video so very different there anyway 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.850
 culture 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.660
 best why is he not fake halls 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.660
 is about participating
