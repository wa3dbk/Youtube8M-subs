00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is not you know this has a little bit

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
is not you know this has a little bit
much<00:02:05.520> wider<00:02:05.909> feel<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> fit<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.960> doesn't

can<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.560> they<00:02:10.709> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> went<00:02:11.130> for<00:02:11.310> that

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
can see they kind of went for that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.990 
can see they kind of went for that
similar<00:02:12.120> look<00:02:12.450> altogether<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:14.430> it

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
similar look altogether so that's it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300 
similar look altogether so that's it
I<00:02:15.060> will<00:02:15.720> say<00:02:15.900> though<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.830> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I will say though I do like this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.520 
I will say though I do like this

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
controller it works very well it's a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.050 
controller it works very well it's a
little<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> narrow<00:02:20.160> fit<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.700> has<00:02:20.819> more

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
little bit of a narrow fit it has more

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.500 
little bit of a narrow fit it has more
of<00:02:21.330> Xbox<00:02:22.140> fit<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.910> most

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
people will be used to that but I think

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.440 
people will be used to that but I think
