these<00:00:16.949> are<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.369> important<00:00:17.760> because<00:00:17.880> they

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
these are really important because they

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380 
these are really important because they
carry<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.230> spark<00:00:19.650> into<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.910> chamber<00:00:21.240> where

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
carry the spark into the chamber where

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
carry the spark into the chamber where
it's<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> ignite<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> gas<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.010> give

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it's going to ignite the gas and give

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.839 
it's going to ignite the gas and give
you<00:00:23.699> power<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.210> vehicle

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849

Oh your spark plug kit I looked up on
the<00:01:32.479> internet<00:01:32.869> trying<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.200> find<00:01:33.259> these<00:01:33.590> things

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
pull them out from the spark plug that's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.010 
pull them out from the spark plug that's
one<00:02:43.440> end<00:02:43.590> there<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.880> nice<00:02:45.060> pretty<00:02:45.720> hole

and then you just pull the other side
out<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.830> distributor<00:02:52.520> one<00:02:53.520> at<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.700> time

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
this is going in the second spot down

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.560 
this is going in the second spot down
there<00:03:00.950> when<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.070> have<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.400> without<00:03:05.480> put<00:03:06.480> in

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
there when you have that without put in

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.810 
there when you have that without put in
your<00:03:06.690> replacement<00:03:07.260> these<00:03:08.040> wires<00:03:08.250> seem<00:03:08.670> to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
your replacement these wires seem to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.810 
your replacement these wires seem to
have<00:03:08.940> two<00:03:09.210> ends<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:10.140> looks<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
have two ends one looks like that the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.040 
have two ends one looks like that the
other<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:13.440> slightly<00:03:14.310> more<00:03:14.580> knobby<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.180> don't

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
other is slightly more knobby I don't

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.390 
other is slightly more knobby I don't
really<00:03:16.260> know<00:03:16.470> what<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.680> if<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.130> makes<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
really know what that if it makes a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.740 
really know what that if it makes a
difference<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.240> something<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.540> noticed

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
difference but it's something I noticed

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.020 
difference but it's something I noticed
and<00:03:19.140> made<00:03:19.260> sure<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.950> put<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.640> new<00:03:20.760> parts

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and made sure that I put the new parts

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.170 
and made sure that I put the new parts
on<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.480> same<00:03:21.690> way<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.400> plug<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.670> back<00:03:23.850> in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
on the same way so you plug that back in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
on the same way so you plug that back in
there<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.850> with<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> other<00:03:30.240> hand<00:03:30.570> make

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
there and then with the other hand make

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
there and then with the other hand make
sure<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.250> kind<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.580> have<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> wire

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
sure you know you kind of have the wire

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.250 
sure you know you kind of have the wire
where<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.690> want<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.550> other<00:03:38.760> end

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
where you want it and then the other end

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.430 
where you want it and then the other end
you<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.290> plug<00:03:40.710> back<00:03:40.980> into<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.930> spark<00:03:43.230> plug

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
you just plug back into the spark plug

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.520 
you just plug back into the spark plug
or<00:03:44.220> did<00:03:44.430> wipe<00:03:44.790> off<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> spark<00:03:45.420> plugs<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
or did wipe off the spark plugs on the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.400 
or did wipe off the spark plugs on the
inside<00:03:47.150> mine<00:03:48.150> seemed<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> little<00:03:48.570> oily<00:03:48.870> that's

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
inside mine seemed a little oily that's

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.510 
inside mine seemed a little oily that's
probably<00:03:49.770> not<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> good<00:03:50.130> sign

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
probably not a good sign

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.140 
probably not a good sign
make<00:03:50.730> sure<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> push<00:03:51.330> them<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.920> way

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
make sure you push them in all the way

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.730 
make sure you push them in all the way
because<00:03:54.150> that's<00:03:54.390> what's<00:03:54.630> giving<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.290> your

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
because that's what's giving you your

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.510 
because that's what's giving you your
spark<00:03:56.100> connection<00:03:56.490> in<00:03:56.610> your<00:03:56.760> car<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:59.040> then<00:03:59.190> I

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
spark connection in your car and then I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.340 
spark connection in your car and then I
have<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.210> little<00:04:00.450> things<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.840> tip<00:04:00.990> them<00:04:01.170> off

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
have these little things to tip them off

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.220 
have these little things to tip them off
my<00:04:01.920> headers<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.490> my<00:04:02.640> car<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.210> you<00:04:03.750> just<00:04:03.990> adjust

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
my headers in my car so you just adjust

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.590 
my headers in my car so you just adjust
those<00:04:04.740> put<00:04:05.580> them<00:04:05.730> back<00:04:05.820> into<00:04:06.030> place<00:04:06.120> they<00:04:06.510> have

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
those put them back into place they have

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.120 
those put them back into place they have
little<00:04:06.780> screws<00:04:07.080> I've<00:04:07.560> already<00:04:07.830> done<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.040> on

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
little screws I've already done it on

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.020 
little screws I've already done it on
the<00:04:08.220> other<00:04:08.310> side

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.850 

so<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.180> see<00:04:13.480> everything's<00:04:14.410> back<00:04:14.620> in<00:04:14.740> its

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
so you see everything's back in its

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.600 
so you see everything's back in its
place<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.060> nice<00:04:16.209> orderly<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:18.220> make<00:04:18.400> sure

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:18.610 
place and a nice orderly just make sure

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.650 
place and a nice orderly just make sure
you're<00:04:18.790> keeping<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:20.380> plugs<00:04:21.000> away<00:04:22.000> from<00:04:22.420> the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
you're keeping the plugs away from the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.320 
you're keeping the plugs away from the
headers<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:24.220> they're<00:04:24.880> not<00:04:24.970> going<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.180> get<00:04:25.300> a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
headers so they're not going to get a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.210 
headers so they're not going to get a
hole<00:04:25.480> and<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:27.280> think<00:04:28.060> that's<00:04:28.210> about<00:04:28.450> it

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
hole and I think that's about it

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.430 
hole and I think that's about it
happy<00:04:30.220> trails
