they<00:00:31.200> start<00:00:31.530> by<00:00:31.619> cooking<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.400> big<00:00:32.610> batch<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
they start by cooking up a big batch of

they start by cooking up a big batch of
sugar<00:00:33.540> water<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> corn<00:00:34.800> syrup

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.760 

next<00:00:39.850> they<00:00:40.210> prepare<00:00:40.600> a<00:00:40.630> mix<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.140> starch<00:00:41.500> and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
next they prepare a mix of starch and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.140 
next they prepare a mix of starch and
flavoring<00:00:42.430> like<00:00:42.910> peppermint<00:00:43.300> or<00:00:43.930> strawberry

as they blend them together the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.110 

they<00:00:53.440> empty<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:53.920> flavoring<00:00:54.370> mix<00:00:54.670> into<00:00:54.940> the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
they empty the flavoring mix into the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.869 
they empty the flavoring mix into the
middle<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.840> syrupy<00:00:56.320> slap<00:00:56.620> then<00:00:57.489> they<00:00:57.670> feed

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
middle of the syrupy slap then they feed

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.639 
middle of the syrupy slap then they feed
the<00:00:58.000> whole<00:00:58.210> thing<00:00:58.480> into<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.750> machine<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.410> uses

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
the whole thing into a machine that uses

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.130 
the whole thing into a machine that uses
shovels<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.489> plunger<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:01.420> fold<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.930> batch

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
shovels and a plunger to fold the batch

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.460 
shovels and a plunger to fold the batch
repeatedly<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:04.570> distributes<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
repeatedly this distributes the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:18.090 
repeatedly this distributes the
flavouring<00:01:05.950> evenly

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.890 

cold<00:01:19.100> water<00:01:19.400> piped<00:01:19.910> into<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.270> shovels<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
cold water piped into the shovels and

cold water piped into the shovels and
the<00:01:21.050> kneading<00:01:21.410> table<00:01:21.860> cools<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.610> candy<00:01:22.970> cane

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the kneading table cools the candy cane

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.810 
the kneading table cools the candy cane
mix<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.110> takes<00:01:24.350> on<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.560> stiffer<00:01:25.010> consistency

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
mix so it takes on a stiffer consistency

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.870 
mix so it takes on a stiffer consistency

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
they roll the candy into a flat lock

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.919 
they roll the candy into a flat lock
while<00:01:58.250> heaters<00:01:58.700> warm<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.210> making<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.689> pliable

next they roll strips of red color candy
a<00:02:13.060> worker<00:02:14.060> then<00:02:14.390> stretches<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.170> folds<00:02:15.560> the
