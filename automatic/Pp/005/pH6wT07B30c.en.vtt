00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
on the vehicle was in gold and the
vehicle<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.360> black<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:46.020> believe<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
vehicle is in black I do believe and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.139 
vehicle is in black I do believe and
this<00:01:47.280> one's<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.759> different<00:01:48.119> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
this one's a little bit different you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
this one's a little bit different you
have<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> multicolored<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.259> scheme<00:01:49.439> going

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
have a multicolored kind of scheme going

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.560 
have a multicolored kind of scheme going
on<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.399> personal<00:01:50.790> opinion<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.540> think

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
on and in my personal opinion I think

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
on and in my personal opinion I think
this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.990> actually<00:01:52.079> looks<00:01:52.290> quite<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.799> bare

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
this one actually looks quite a bit bare

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
this one actually looks quite a bit bare
but<00:01:53.189> once<00:01:53.340> again<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.240> opinion<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
but once again but as an opinion there I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.910 
but once again but as an opinion there I
just<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> definitely<00:01:55.590> looks<00:01:55.890> better

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
just think it definitely looks better

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.740 
just think it definitely looks better
than<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> earth<00:01:56.399> screenshots<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.600> have

potential release time is for this

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.420 
potential release time is for this

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
don't know what time and I'd say there's

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.480 
don't know what time and I'd say there's
two<00:03:01.210> possible<00:03:01.630> times<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.620> intrusion<00:03:03.190> by

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
two possible times for this intrusion by

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.180 
two possible times for this intrusion by
the<00:03:03.550> old<00:03:03.760> dioc<00:03:04.180> releases<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.900> believe<00:03:05.650> pretty

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the old dioc releases I believe pretty

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.160 
the old dioc releases I believe pretty
much<00:03:06.340> every<00:03:06.820> single<00:03:07.030> deity<00:03:07.270> update<00:03:07.840> apart

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
much every single deity update apart

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.050 
much every single deity update apart
from<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.380> host<00:03:08.530> update<00:03:08.950> actually<00:03:09.700> came<00:03:09.880> out

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
from the host update actually came out

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.960 
from the host update actually came out
like<00:03:10.150> 10<00:03:10.540> a.m.<00:03:10.990> gmt<00:03:11.560> UK<00:03:11.920> time<00:03:12.190> which<00:03:12.760> i<00:03:12.850> believe

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
like 10 a.m. gmt UK time which i believe

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.840 
like 10 a.m. gmt UK time which i believe
is<00:03:13.090> around<00:03:13.450> six<00:03:13.930> a.m.<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.650> eastern<00:03:15.340> time<00:03:15.550> now

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
is around six a.m. in eastern time now

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.060 
is around six a.m. in eastern time now
this<00:03:16.660> actually<00:03:16.900> changed<00:03:17.620> with<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.890> highest

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
this actually changed with the highest

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.140 
this actually changed with the highest
update<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.610> high<00:03:18.700> stock<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.090> was

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
update the high stock that was

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.400 
update the high stock that was
completely<00:03:19.510> different<00:03:19.630> I<00:03:19.870> believe<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.170> came

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
completely different I believe this came

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.030 
completely different I believe this came
out<00:03:20.440> 12<00:03:21.040> a.m.<00:03:21.490> at<00:03:22.030> eastern<00:03:22.450> time<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.930> at<00:03:23.350> 4am

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
out 12 a.m. at eastern time and at 4am

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.820 
out 12 a.m. at eastern time and at 4am
UK<00:03:24.970> gmt<00:03:25.540> time<00:03:25.750> now<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.200> course<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.770> you

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
UK gmt time now of course if you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.930 
UK gmt time now of course if you
different<00:03:27.070> different<00:03:27.250> time<00:03:27.490> zones<00:03:27.730> always

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
different different time zones always

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.280 
different different time zones always
try<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.360> images<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:28.900> your<00:03:28.930> screen<00:03:29.260> or

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
try to have images on your screen or

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.600 
try to have images on your screen or
easily<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.740> could<00:03:29.830> just<00:03:29.950> buccal<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.430> time

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
easily you could just buccal the time

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.760 
easily you could just buccal the time
zones<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.110> different<00:03:32.110> time<00:03:32.260> zones<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.590> stuff

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
zones of different time zones and stuff

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.100 
zones of different time zones and stuff
like<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.490> those<00:03:34.330> are<00:03:34.660> really<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.990> two

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
like that but those are really the two

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.260 
like that but those are really the two
plausible<00:03:35.530> times<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> feeling<00:03:37.060> this

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
plausible times I have a feeling this

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.730 
plausible times I have a feeling this
DLC<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.960> get<00:03:38.050> released<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.500> so
