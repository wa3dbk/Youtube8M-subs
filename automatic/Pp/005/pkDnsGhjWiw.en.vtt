00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
was that site of course we were at the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.680 
was that site of course we were at the
tithe<00:01:47.860> is<00:01:47.890> just<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.250> little<00:01:48.460> high<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.970> there

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
tithe is just a little high and there

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.649 
tithe is just a little high and there
isn't<00:01:49.990> beach<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.409> this<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.330> it's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> little

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659

right<00:01:58.600> over<00:01:58.780> there
