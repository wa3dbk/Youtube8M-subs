00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:22.160
 If it's not originally- like today 's birds, let 5 dozen lo 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.160
 Neen basics 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.270
 It is a difficult old man 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.810
 I know that I can grip as much as I can, but I still stay 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.810
 Seg 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.200
 It is the beginning of the year Te if Yokun 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.730
 Just now almost joined Well there is no human being 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.060
 I don't have enough grip to get it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.060
 Yup 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.469
 That guide car is great because you can climb such a place 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.370
 I wonder if Yukko's sister is getting tight 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.750
 It is it straight to shoot out 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.020
 I'm taking it with iphone right now 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.230
 There is no particular waterproof function 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 But I'm with Kada 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.940
 If it's about to become audition already 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940
 I stopped shooting 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 If you say that really 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.479
 Andrew of Yumesakai straight so that straighten fear force rather not cant Which one 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.470
 Become 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 Seeing well from the beginning 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.960
 If after you start to accelerate once 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 I will not stop the car 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.390
 The number of rotations that the grip is likely to be maximized 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.650
 I will keep it 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.760
 With a diesel car 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.840
 Is a minute 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.840
 Even if I work on the accelerator 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 I do not go 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.270
 With or there is love or response the number of revolutions of the tire as a corridor that brake Ultra 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.800
 I actually called Na what what are you doing to grip 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.840
 Check the tires from the driver's seat 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.069
 You can see how many times you look better, but while sitting in the driver's seat 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.750
 Only that sense 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.450
 Bridge rules 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.920
 And is not to grip while watching it you know well that the way 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.920
 I work in reverse 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.560
 I think it is easy to understand 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.019
 It's a grip new work Nino Bow shop and say so 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.019
 I did it quite well 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 Mata Shazam like When was I want to increase the number of revolutions is more of the same work more engine comfortable 9 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.100
 Arms too 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.230
 Since Dekiru heard the rotational speed of the tire to say high 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.950
 It will be easier to run on rainy days 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.950
 It is Yu 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 If it peels off here, it will be soil of Hawaii from below . 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.800
 It's a bit too low now 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:14.890
 A little from this place where little was complete works 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.890
 Right tire falls behind the right back body 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.530
 Use 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.150
 I mean, that's right I turned the handle a bit to the right 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.730
 Nde has become perhaps resistance in there that can be accelerated 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.760
 There is not resistance as much as possible 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.990
 Spelling 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.830
 Keep it straight to the Self Defense Force 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.830
 A little right jerk 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.180
 I can not think 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.940
 The right sheet Gunma 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:50.200
 Straight or slightly around the left Te long time ago 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:55.270
 I 'm climbing behind with a traction US emphasis on prizes 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:59.820
 k I think the enemy may flow to the right but the car is still moving 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.820
 There is a high possibility of new tax still 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.660
 Collective production 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.660
 It's like this sea , but I 'm cutting it right now 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.860
 If you feel at the reception desk, that one is better 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.670
 Rakuten has to be I have been obtained after the second 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.670
 Well okay 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.250
 It's not right 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:30.100
 It is really the difference of that Sakurai but I wonder if the car will move forward 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.700
 Well it might have been the difference of instinct net several tens of centimeters 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.700
 The rest is this 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.520
 It's not a low waist success 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.520
 Low success 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.279
 It is the candle 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.710
 After that, I should not be honest enough, but I'm increasing the rotation speed to some extent 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.400
 Connect 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.400
 So that 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.009
 Faction rookie Otani 6 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.310
 I will exhibit japan device though 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.780
 The point is that the traction of the tire turns 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.820
 To compensate for the grip force 's not easy after too much rotation of the tire 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.750
 You earn traction 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.720
 To say 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.080
 Use it nicely in political affairs 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.580
 Work to get stronger forward power 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.580
 It's a shame, but there is a considerable burden on the clutch 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.440
 I think I will not do much 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.259
 There is something like this 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:50.180
 Finally But I was a little tilted to the right straight even without a steering operation at all the other true 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.390
 Only in a much keep to another accelerator operation 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.830
 If you concentrate 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.970
 To be able to move forward 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.780
 That day of rain is quite many , so I say so 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:07.729
 Say so to the left to the right in order to obtain a well say, is not it or grip 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:14.680
 It's because I was sewing on a rainy day 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:16.960
 That I Nde sometimes in the rolling resistance of the tire is not climb out 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.409
 maybe 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.689
 Depending on the person 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:23.110
 I say that I am sewing 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.110
 that 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.740
 Well some people without such awareness 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.070
 Have actually seen by I think that many 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.070
 It is I have become another hard 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.590
 Happy Oh went out thorough and in that way 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.660
 I understand 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.080
 We should try 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.860
 On the contrary, the difference is that it has been a hindrance to the rumor 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:53.710
 I understand 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:56.780
 Only really accelerator operation with little to steering operation and sweet to the US advance 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:02.320
 It is a beautiful scene earning the whole body gate 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.320
 I think whether or not there Well kind of people I'm the kana not it good I when you come across
