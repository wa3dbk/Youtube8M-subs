00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.859
 I have no doubt that we 'll see 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'll explain how to make the regulation 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.679
 of motor valves hemi 3 5 2 500 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.049
 mercedes 1113 first trucks 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 something that we are going to try to explain 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
 How are we going to regulate in just 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 two turns in the engine than 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.260
 necessary to dig the Lanciano system 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 I shook the first regulus this to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 to be second regular what ends up giving 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.470
 many engine turns will only make 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.239
 two drops 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.559
 first we had as 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.360
 combustion or 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 either did not swing first five and 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.360
 throw the basket in the back so that it 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.780
 spoke and drum he was the first 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 which are in pm s with a first that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:14.220
 are here ahead in the process of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 combustion here in the front making two 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:42.829
 laps we do the following contagion 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:42.829
 12 35 79 30 as state with 33 79 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.939
 counterclockwise will give more clearance 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:18.170
 of 30 and goes through 2011 an effort and a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:21.989
 blade 17 holds close to 30 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.530
 Now we talk talk like 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.370
 agent lanciano last and cylinder and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.690
 we started counting 12 35 79 from the front 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.690
 now we do the opposite as 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.610
 balance the first cylinder or 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.190
 unfinished so last start this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.250
 2357 same ball back to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.180
 compared to taking stock of this first 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 get rid of the pain 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.120
 here begins in April the valve of 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.400
 exhaust 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.370
 She will close now she starts and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.980
 starts to open the intake valve 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.500
 that the balance of that first cylinder 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.930
 balanced we can do the same 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.200
 counting numbering 12 35 79 beginning 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.200
 on here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.110
 23 57 9 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.910
 perfect in two laps we make 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.800
 engine adjustment just for us 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.210
 take the real test 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.410
 as the site of the simulation does 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.910
 adjustments such as balancing the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.380
 this is the fourth cylinder to regulate the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.220
 third province 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 it worked out 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.660
 The value of the campuses starts closed to 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.200
 start a new cycle with button open 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.200
 dimension 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.960
 Samba is undermining the two, this is the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.770
 this is a process that we had a 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.800
 farm in two and only goal with 2 357 9 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.590
 When you say something you start at 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.210
 front I went back and it starts behind 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.210
 forward 237 hall
