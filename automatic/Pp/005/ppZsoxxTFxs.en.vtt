00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.730
 to have 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.610
 really you can go in the pike tom 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.680
 for which to be with deer center 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.949
 well of everything and some mark one 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.960
 fiesta to well the more intense stuff 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.940
 little to do you combine between two 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 becomes supercars 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 Once the laundry was full of the Ford GT 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.620
 I don't take 40 original ones 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 those 40 are their own informed and 40 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.020
 inch rogers if it's a meter that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.450
 very low and with that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.310
 we also immediately hit problems that only get there 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.650
 really for no meter 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.570
 really a pity I can board and order 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.820
 fold myself into beijing and then sit 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 the pedals about bikini ever you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.360
 you while your space behind you can be a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 ier ni where we have a happy one 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.840
 volunteer found that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.150
 the car or do briefly addition 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.190
 throwing for us just once am just 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.190
 got into the ford gt 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.149
 I was actually in the 2005 Ford GT 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.979
 also not very tasty for one 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.110
 Slightly slumped then you will neck 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 that jesus that guy who pins 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.679
 the right but it is also very 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.420
 I now the lily a bit to 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.000
 and I'm sitting a bit 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.220
 wide leg compress own way 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.310
 that guest was 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.320
 a city especially in step and get out 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.760
 but had to get in then you have the door 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.620
 close it in and that part of it 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.520
 the roof that they have done before 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.530
 because 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.640
 Ford GT was originally intended for 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.100
 mans 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.480
 small compact car but of course it is 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 can drive fast in ice 24 hours full of him 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.200
 if that youtube already briefly to one 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.760
 just allow so much space because today 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 also opened the day 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.170
 compare between two a piece a whole 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.830
 very funny because yes we are just one 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.970
 a few years later and then you see that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.920
 technology do the piece further 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.320
 much similarity basic layout v8 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 just the middle engine 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.490
 rear wheel drive natural hair 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.540
 yes the agreements also hold there 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.350
 a little bit up 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.050
 as had by gloomy gt 9 but 900 kilos 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.370
 but three 135 hp 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.950
 this much heavier but logical 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.410
 safety things in space also one 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.330
 much bigger stronger engine is my name 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.650
 they must get strong on those too 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.550
 super charger in the mood for 185 meters ahead 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.730
 550 hp and a torque of almost 700 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.340
 youtube meter that it goes i caught 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.920
 myself every other time we switch on 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.190
 5 5 and or 1000 revolutions tori maximum 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.210
 mailbox power is half a life on 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.920
 a form 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.860
 yes am impressed by the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.160
 acceleration and also the sound 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.970
 sit where you 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.740
 [Music] 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.380
 just come because you have to 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.110
 really go so much harder in the end 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.390
 of course where people don't 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.880
 yolk in another category has run out 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.289
 other fast cars 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.289
 [Music] 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.120
 I did not go in the GT40 with me 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.250
 that fits mouth just one of the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.370
 seven higher than very copy 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.010
 they market the number seven for free gt40 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.560
 built on the road for that matter 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.990
 definitely a week then rent one 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.850
 therefore full had a difference on the modern 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.260
 throwing a car is a lot harder 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.130
 become pawns and I set piece 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.079
 flatter 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.359
 also much more stable at high 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.710
 speed that old car type really one 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.280
 bit 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.160
 lives more to the new GT 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.490
 but sleep 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490
 boxing 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.449
 okay just fly car to drive 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:39.159
 as long as you know what you are doing 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.739
 also what if you're in but hear some wheel spin 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.099
 gets what they can do fairly easily 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.099
 I report you 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
 Well then you feel the back of coming 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.530
 where there is no weird for if it's on one 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.310
 visible loss of rights 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.100
 zwolle yes well-balanced car 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.100
 [Music] 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.640
 subscribe the car boll purchase advice to 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.220
 if you have about one and a half million euros left 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.600
 it you are smaller than once 1 meter 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.480
 75 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.800
 we are just for the 69 euro variant 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.390
 go for 3d 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.310
 and if you still buy it in you there 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.169
 we get enough money for simply yet 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.810
 modern ford gt 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.220
 yes and for all others just buy this 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.890
 can not go wrong because of the 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.540
 neighbors say yes I will buy you and 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.870
 you tell the enthusiasts which ones 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.870
 exactly 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.600
 and then I hear your questions which are 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.260
 faster we love or the new and that 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.260
 we have tested
