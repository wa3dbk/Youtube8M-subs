00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
if I really could put him down because

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.180 
if I really could put him down because
some<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.840> these<00:02:36.959> god<00:02:37.260> mode<00:02:37.470> hacks<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:38.070> be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
some of these god mode hacks can be

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.340 
some of these god mode hacks can be
broken<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.180> one<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.690> wasn't<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> case

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
broken but this one it wasn't the case

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.740 
broken but this one it wasn't the case
his<00:02:40.950> hack<00:02:41.190> was<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.670> too<00:02:41.850> goddamn<00:02:42.030> powerful

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
his hack was just too goddamn powerful

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.449 
his hack was just too goddamn powerful
so<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> few<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:43.860> reruns

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
so I'm going to do a few little reruns
