00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
especially at night it's very disturbing

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.300 
especially at night it's very disturbing
and<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:37.579> know<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.910> drives<00:00:38.030> me<00:00:38.450> crazy<00:00:39.310> it's

and and I know it drives me crazy it's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.100 
and and I know it drives me crazy it's
such<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.579> serious<00:00:41.060> problem<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:41.930> many

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
such a serious problem and so many

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.389 
such a serious problem and so many
people<00:00:42.290> are<00:00:42.470> concerned<00:00:42.680> with<00:00:43.010> it<00:00:43.130> that<00:00:43.250> even

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
people are concerned with it that even

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.460 
people are concerned with it that even
Congress<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.180> trying<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.600> pass<00:00:45.230> legislation

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
Congress is trying to pass legislation

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.060 
Congress is trying to pass legislation
to<00:00:46.070> get<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:46.460> under<00:00:46.640> control<00:00:47.380> but<00:00:48.380> as<00:00:48.620> with

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
to get this under control but as with

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.010 
to get this under control but as with
many<00:00:49.900> pieces<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:51.050> legislation<00:00:52.240> it's<00:00:53.240> it's

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
many pieces of legislation it's it's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.900 
many pieces of legislation it's it's
only<00:00:54.410> part<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> solution<00:00:55.070> it's<00:00:55.640> not<00:00:55.880> a

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
only part of the solution it's not a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.000 
only part of the solution it's not a
full<00:00:56.240> solution

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
full solution

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.280 
full solution
so<00:00:58.010> at<00:00:58.370> SRS<00:00:59.000> we've<00:00:59.210> developed<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> technology

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
so at SRS we've developed a technology

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.910 
so at SRS we've developed a technology
called<00:01:00.530> true<00:01:01.250> volume<00:01:01.720> which<00:01:02.920> actually

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
called true volume which actually

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.310 
called true volume which actually
controls<00:01:04.400> these<00:01:04.850> levels<00:01:05.239> shifts<00:01:05.630> at<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
controls these levels shifts at the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.890 
controls these levels shifts at the
endpoint<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.340> your<00:01:07.520> home<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.270> TV<00:01:08.630> set<00:01:08.869> or

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
endpoint in your home in the TV set or

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.160 
endpoint in your home in the TV set or
in<00:01:09.140> your<00:01:09.290> set-top<00:01:09.710> box<00:01:10.009> and<00:01:10.689> gets<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:11.869> stuff

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
in your set-top box and gets this stuff

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.319 
in your set-top box and gets this stuff
under<00:01:12.439> control<00:01:12.590> at<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.790> point<00:01:14.030> where<00:01:14.210> it

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
under control at the point where it

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.620 
under control at the point where it
really<00:01:14.360> makes<00:01:14.780> sense<00:01:15.460> because<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.000> can

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
really makes sense because you can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870 
really makes sense because you can
regulate<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.230> volume<00:01:18.590> at<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.010> TV<00:01:19.310> station

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
regulate the volume at one TV station

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.149 
regulate the volume at one TV station
but<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.600> can't<00:01:20.810> match<00:01:21.020> all<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.409> TV<00:01:21.710> stations

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
but you can't match all the TV stations

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.470 
but you can't match all the TV stations
all<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.550> hundreds<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.090> hundreds<00:01:23.390> of

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
all the hundreds and hundreds of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.930 
all the hundreds and hundreds of
channels<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.080> come<00:01:24.560> in

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
channels that come in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.010 
channels that come in
you<00:01:26.360> also<00:01:26.600> can't<00:01:27.400> regulate<00:01:28.400> volume<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.330> that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
you also can't regulate volume at that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.320 
you also can't regulate volume at that
point<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.590> control<00:01:30.979> other<00:01:31.250> sources<00:01:31.760> if

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
point and control other sources if

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.670 
point and control other sources if
you're<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:32.630> me<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.960> have<00:01:32.990> lots<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.440> sources

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
you're like me you have lots of sources

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.649 
you're like me you have lots of sources
hooked<00:01:34.010> up<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.250> your<00:01:34.310> TV<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.060> DVD

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
hooked up to your TV you have a DVD

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.410 
hooked up to your TV you have a DVD
player<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:36.050> blu-ray<00:01:36.530> player<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:37.159> game<00:01:37.850> console

all<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.840> those<00:01:38.900> things<00:01:39.170> are<00:01:39.320> operating<00:01:39.710> at

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
all of those things are operating at

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.050 
all of those things are operating at
different<00:01:39.860> levels<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.580> every<00:01:40.760> time<00:01:40.940> you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
different levels and every time you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.210 
different levels and every time you
change<00:01:41.330> those<00:01:41.510> inputs<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.409> volumes<00:01:42.830> going<00:01:43.040> to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
change those inputs the volumes going to

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.270 
change those inputs the volumes going to
shift<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.420> even<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.470> get<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.770> volume<00:01:46.010> under

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
control between the program and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.640 
control between the program and
commercial<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:50.240> very<00:01:50.570> very<00:01:50.870> complicated<00:01:51.260> much

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
commercial is very very complicated much

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.840 
commercial is very very complicated much
more<00:01:51.830> complicated<00:01:52.190> than<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:52.640> would<00:01:52.760> imagine

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
more complicated than you would imagine

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.090 
more complicated than you would imagine
you<00:01:53.270> would<00:01:53.299> think<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.930> these<00:01:54.470> guys<00:01:54.530> are

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
you would think that these guys are

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.500 
you would think that these guys are
professionals<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.030> work<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.390> these

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
professionals that work in these

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.210 
professionals that work in these
stations<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.110> these<00:01:57.229> studios<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.950> they<00:01:58.040> can

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
stations in these studios and they can

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.920 
stations in these studios and they can
turn<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.729> knob<00:01:59.000> up<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.390> down<00:01:59.510> or<00:01:59.690> do<00:01:59.780> whatever

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
turn a knob up and down or do whatever

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.870 
turn a knob up and down or do whatever
they<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.260> with<00:02:00.530> their<00:02:00.680> meters<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.430> get

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
they do with their meters and and get

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.010 
they do with their meters and and get
everything<00:02:02.090> under<00:02:02.390> control<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:02.900> it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
everything under control but it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.750 
everything under control but it
unfortunately<00:02:03.650> it's<00:02:03.799> not<00:02:03.950> as<00:02:04.100> simple<00:02:04.460> as<00:02:04.549> that

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
unfortunately it's not as simple as that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.690 
unfortunately it's not as simple as that
and<00:02:05.440> I'll<00:02:06.440> explain<00:02:06.830> one<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.190> reasons<00:02:07.610> for

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
and I'll explain one of the reasons for

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.449 
and I'll explain one of the reasons for
that<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:09.259> kind<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.649> one<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.009> tricks<00:02:10.280> they

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
that it's kind of one of the tricks they

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.220 
that it's kind of one of the tricks they
play<00:02:10.489> when<00:02:10.849> they<00:02:10.939> produce<00:02:11.330> commercials<00:02:12.019> to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
play when they produce commercials to

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.520 
play when they produce commercials to
kind<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:13.069> them<00:02:13.250> blast<00:02:13.670> out<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:15.379> we

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
kind of make them blast out at you if we

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
kind of make them blast out at you if we
look<00:02:15.709> at<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> typical<00:02:18.430> signal<00:02:19.430> audio<00:02:20.060> signal

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
look at a typical signal audio signal

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.290 
look at a typical signal audio signal
from<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.950> TV<00:02:21.950> show<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> sports<00:02:22.670> broadcast

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
from a TV show like a sports broadcast

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.800 
from a TV show like a sports broadcast
or<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.599> movie<00:02:23.990> if

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
or a movie if

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.080 
or a movie if
that<00:02:25.050> they<00:02:25.170> put<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> announcers<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.880> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
that they put the announcers or the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.030 
that they put the announcers or the
dialogue<00:02:27.599> down<00:02:27.959> let's<00:02:28.319> say<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> at

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
dialogue down let's say they put it at

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
dialogue down let's say they put it at
this<00:02:29.250> level<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.660> let's<00:02:30.840> say<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this level and let's say this is the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830 
this level and let's say this is the
maximum<00:02:31.739> level<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:33.000> go<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.239> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
maximum level that we can go to and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.570 
maximum level that we can go to and
that's<00:02:34.020> what<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.349> meters<00:02:34.739> typically<00:02:35.340> show

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that's what the meters typically show

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.089 
that's what the meters typically show
where<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.959> where<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.500> go<00:02:37.680> without

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
where what where we can go without

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.250 
where what where we can go without
getting<00:02:39.090> into<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> problem<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.870> meter<00:02:40.050> says

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
getting into a problem the meter says

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.860 
getting into a problem the meter says
this<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.680> high<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.069> can<00:02:41.190> go

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
this is as high as you can go

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.330 
this is as high as you can go
so<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.019> announcers<00:02:43.470> talking<00:02:43.680> along<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.250> all

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so the announcers talking along and all

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.500 
so the announcers talking along and all
of<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.430> sudden<00:02:44.459> there's<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.819> home<00:02:45.060> run<00:02:45.269> or<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
of a sudden there's a home run or a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.509 
of a sudden there's a home run or a
touchdown<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:46.500> something<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> crowd

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
touchdown or something and the crowd

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.270 
touchdown or something and the crowd
cheers<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:50.010> signal<00:02:50.430> goes<00:02:50.459> way<00:02:51.269> way<00:02:51.300> up

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
cheers and the signal goes way way up

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.210 
cheers and the signal goes way way up
then<00:02:53.280> everything<00:02:53.580> calms<00:02:53.819> down<00:02:53.940> again<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
then everything calms down again and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.500 
then everything calms down again and
they<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.580> announcer<00:02:57.000> down<00:02:57.209> at<00:02:57.330> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
they have the announcer down at this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.400 
they have the announcer down at this
level<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.640> completely<00:03:00.569> normal<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.319> you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
level so that's completely normal if you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
level so that's completely normal if you
were<00:03:01.709> trying<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.130> squish<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.700> down<00:03:02.940> or

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
were trying to squish this down or

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.960 
were trying to squish this down or
change<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.140> ratio<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.799> any<00:03:04.920> way<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.730> take

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
change this ratio in any way you take

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.789 
change this ratio in any way you take
away<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.480> lot<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.140> excitement<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
away a lot of the excitement of the

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.080 
away a lot of the excitement of the
program<00:03:08.190> itself<00:03:08.549> but<00:03:09.530> then<00:03:10.530> those<00:03:11.489> nefarious

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
program itself but then those nefarious

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
program itself but then those nefarious
commercial<00:03:12.599> guys<00:03:12.780> come<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.560> they<00:03:14.280> say

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
commercial guys come on and they say

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.250 
commercial guys come on and they say
well<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.880> don't<00:03:15.090> need<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.569> this<00:03:15.720> room<00:03:16.019> we

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
well we don't need all this room we

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199 
well we don't need all this room we
don't<00:03:16.380> need<00:03:16.590> all<00:03:16.799> this<00:03:16.950> space<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.549> here<00:03:17.760> we

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
don't need all this space in here we

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.180 
don't need all this space in here we
know<00:03:18.390> what<00:03:18.569> our<00:03:18.690> commercial<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.380> it's<00:03:19.980> not

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
know what our commercial is it's not

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.339 
know what our commercial is it's not
going<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> suddenly<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:21.060> louder<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:22.170> we're

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
going to suddenly get louder so we're

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.089 
going to suddenly get louder so we're
gonna<00:03:22.470> push<00:03:22.769> everything<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.660> level

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
gonna push everything up to this level

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.740 
gonna push everything up to this level
so<00:03:26.099> all<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.459> sudden<00:03:26.790> every<00:03:27.209> sound<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so all of a sudden every sound in that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.380 
so all of a sudden every sound in that
commercial<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.040> high<00:03:29.310> level<00:03:29.340> now<00:03:30.299> if

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
commercial is at this high level now if

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.910 
commercial is at this high level now if
you<00:03:30.480> were<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.750> measure<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.350> actually<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you were to measure this actually the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.220 
you were to measure this actually the
maximum<00:03:32.400> level<00:03:32.640> if<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.390> were<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.570> set<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.989> by

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
maximum level if you were to set this by

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.640 
maximum level if you were to set this by
legislation<00:03:35.100> or<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:36.239> simply<00:03:36.600> telling<00:03:37.410> your

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
legislation or just simply telling your

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.710 
legislation or just simply telling your
engineers<00:03:38.100> don't<00:03:38.640> ever<00:03:38.820> exceed<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.329> level

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
engineers don't ever exceed this level

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.050 
engineers don't ever exceed this level
the<00:03:40.709> commercials<00:03:41.160> not<00:03:41.340> exceeding<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.940> level

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
the commercials not exceeding the level

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.449 
the commercials not exceeding the level
it's<00:03:42.510> exactly<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.319> same<00:03:43.530> peak<00:03:43.859> level<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
it's exactly the same peak level as the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.910 
it's exactly the same peak level as the
program<00:03:44.940> but<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> average<00:03:46.109> level<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.739> much

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
program but the average level is so much

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.270 
program but the average level is so much
higher<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.720> that's<00:03:48.720> what<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.140> hear<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
higher and that's what you hear and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.979 
higher and that's what you hear and
that's<00:03:50.489> why<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> commercial<00:03:51.269> sounds<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:51.780> much

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
that's why the commercial sounds so much

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.870 
that's why the commercial sounds so much
higher<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:54.950> with<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> solution<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:56.579> true

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
higher so with a solution like true

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.150 
higher so with a solution like true
volume<00:03:57.269> we<00:03:57.720> understand<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.590> understand

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
volume we understand this we understand

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.090 
volume we understand this we understand
how<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.489> works<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.569> we<00:04:00.930> can<00:04:00.959> bring<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.829> up

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
how this works and we can bring this up

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.120 
how this works and we can bring this up
just<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.519> little<00:04:02.549> bit<00:04:02.819> and<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.569> down<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
just a little bit and this down so the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.920 
just a little bit and this down so the
to<00:04:05.340> meet<00:04:05.609> in<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> middle<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.329> you<00:04:06.690> hear<00:04:06.900> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
to meet in the middle and you hear a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.470 
to meet in the middle and you hear a
very<00:04:07.230> even<00:04:07.889> volume<00:04:08.370> between<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.970> program<00:04:09.359> of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
very even volume between the program of

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.449 
very even volume between the program of
commercial<00:04:09.959> or<00:04:10.200> between<00:04:10.769> channels<00:04:11.130> or

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
commercial or between channels or

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.819 
commercial or between channels or
between<00:04:11.790> sources<00:04:12.239> on<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.630> TV<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:16.650> true

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
between sources on the TV the true

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.440 
between sources on the TV the true
volume<00:04:17.039> also<00:04:17.310> takes<00:04:17.639> into<00:04:17.880> account<00:04:17.910> how

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
volume also takes into account how

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.849 
volume also takes into account how
people<00:04:18.840> hear

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
people hear

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.560 
people hear
we're<00:04:20.280> actually<00:04:20.430> much<00:04:20.729> more<00:04:20.970> sensitive<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
we're actually much more sensitive to

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.480 
we're actually much more sensitive to
volume<00:04:21.870> shifts<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> mid<00:04:22.889> frequencies

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
volume shifts in the mid frequencies

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.029 
volume shifts in the mid frequencies
where<00:04:23.669> voices<00:04:24.300> than<00:04:25.229> we<00:04:25.320> are<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.680> higher<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
where voices than we are the higher and

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.100 
where voices than we are the higher and
lower<00:04:26.160> frequencies<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:27.300> true<00:04:27.510> volume<00:04:27.750> does<00:04:28.080> a

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
lower frequencies so true volume does a

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.969 
lower frequencies so true volume does a
very<00:04:28.410> detailed<00:04:28.919> analysis<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.700> twenty<00:04:30.030> vans<00:04:30.270> of

even<00:04:45.449> volume<00:04:45.839> levels<00:04:46.199> but<00:04:46.349> you<00:04:46.409> don't<00:04:46.710> want<00:04:46.889> to

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
even volume levels but you don't want to

the solution to be worse than the

the solution to be worse than the

soon be available on set-top boxes from
some<00:05:04.559> of<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.710> major<00:05:04.919> satellite<00:05:05.879> and<00:05:06.270> cable

some of the major satellite and cable

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.739 
some of the major satellite and cable
operators<00:05:07.139> and<00:05:07.319> we<00:05:07.580> think<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:09.360> we<00:05:09.719> have

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:09.749 
operators and we think that we have

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:12.739 
operators and we think that we have
really<00:05:10.559> come<00:05:11.009> to<00:05:11.069> the<00:05:11.249> point<00:05:11.599> where<00:05:12.599> we've

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
really come to the point where we've

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.679 
really come to the point where we've
brought<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.259> whole<00:05:13.620> problem<00:05:14.479> under<00:05:15.479> control

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
brought this whole problem under control

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:17.899 
brought this whole problem under control
and<00:05:16.110> hopefully<00:05:16.949> all<00:05:17.159> you'll<00:05:17.370> have<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.580> contend

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
and hopefully all you'll have to contend

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.759 
and hopefully all you'll have to contend
with<00:05:18.059> now<00:05:18.089> is<00:05:18.599> reality<00:05:19.139> shows<00:05:19.610> thank<00:05:20.610> you
