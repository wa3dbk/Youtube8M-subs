00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
about the ingredients right now once

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.540 
about the ingredients right now once
this<00:00:35.329> focus<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:35.990> in<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.710> guys<00:00:36.920> will<00:00:37.220> see<00:00:37.400> that

this focus is in you guys will see that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.190 
this focus is in you guys will see that
there's<00:00:37.790> four<00:00:38.090> main<00:00:38.329> ingredients

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
there's four main ingredients

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.830 
there's four main ingredients
there's<00:00:39.770> creatine<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.790> beta-alanine<00:00:41.540> and

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
there's creatine and beta-alanine and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.170 
there's creatine and beta-alanine and
then<00:00:42.140> tyrosine<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.010> Kathy<00:00:43.430> I'm<00:00:43.670> gonna<00:00:43.940> split

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
then tyrosine and Kathy I'm gonna split

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.030 
then tyrosine and Kathy I'm gonna split
the<00:00:44.390> top<00:00:44.600> two<00:00:44.870> from<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.230> bottom<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.770> where<00:00:45.800> I'm

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
the top two from the bottom to where I'm

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.410 
the top two from the bottom to where I'm
explaining<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.790> because<00:00:47.120> they<00:00:47.270> basically

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
explaining that because they basically

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.210 
explaining that because they basically
are<00:00:47.780> two<00:00:48.079> different<00:00:48.410> purposes

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
are two different purposes

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.880 
are two different purposes
so<00:00:49.880> first<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.720> caffeine<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.649> beta

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
so first the caffeine and the beta

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.920 
so first the caffeine and the beta
alanine<00:00:52.399> it's<00:00:52.970> very<00:00:53.210> important<00:00:53.630> to<00:00:53.720> notice

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
alanine it's very important to notice

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.330 
alanine it's very important to notice
that<00:00:54.110> they're<00:00:54.380> both<00:00:54.590> in<00:00:54.770> there<00:00:54.920> studied

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
that they're both in there studied

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.819 
that they're both in there studied
dosages<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.270> 5<00:00:56.570> grams<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.140> three<00:00:57.380> point<00:00:57.649> two

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
dosages of 5 grams and three point two

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.490 
dosages of 5 grams and three point two
grams<00:00:58.130> respectively<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.329> one<00:01:00.079> thing<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.469> I

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
grams respectively and one thing that I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.010 
grams respectively and one thing that I
found<00:01:00.800> pretty<00:01:01.100> significant<00:01:01.760> about<00:01:02.020> nutrition

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
found pretty significant about nutrition

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.960 
found pretty significant about nutrition
was<00:01:03.200> this<00:01:03.649> wasn't<00:01:03.860> actually<00:01:04.159> their<00:01:04.549> original

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
was this wasn't actually their original

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.840 
was this wasn't actually their original
formula<00:01:05.570> they<00:01:06.110> had<00:01:06.320> lower<00:01:06.560> dosages<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.460> both

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
formula they had lower dosages of both

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.420 
formula they had lower dosages of both
and<00:01:08.380> customers<00:01:09.380> kind<00:01:09.680> of<00:01:09.799> expressed<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
and customers kind of expressed the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.399 
and customers kind of expressed the
concern<00:01:10.460> about<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.570> they<00:01:11.690> changed<00:01:12.229> out

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
concern about that and they changed out

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.050 
concern about that and they changed out
which<00:01:12.560> i<00:01:12.680> think<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.040> really<00:01:13.310> significant

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
which i think is a really significant

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.270 
which i think is a really significant
and<00:01:14.240> says<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.930> lot<00:01:15.229> about<00:01:15.260> their<00:01:15.650> company<00:01:16.100> so

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
and says a lot about their company so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.039 
and says a lot about their company so
firstly<00:01:16.940> if<00:01:17.060> you're<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> performance<00:01:17.810> mind

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
firstly if you're a performance mind

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.109 
firstly if you're a performance mind
path<00:01:18.350> lee<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.130> really<00:01:19.400> should<00:01:19.610> already<00:01:19.820> know

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
path lee you really should already know

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.300 
path lee you really should already know
what<00:01:20.360> creatine<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.049> beta-alanine<00:01:21.710> do<00:01:22.010> for

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
what creatine and beta-alanine do for

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.570 
what creatine and beta-alanine do for
you

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.370 
you
they<00:01:22.940> basically<00:01:23.479> increase<00:01:23.900> your<00:01:24.110> muscular

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
they basically increase your muscular

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.160 
they basically increase your muscular
endurance<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.369> strength<00:01:26.090> over<00:01:26.659> time<00:01:26.690> it's

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
endurance and strength over time it's

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.660 
endurance and strength over time it's
something<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.770> need<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.040> build<00:01:28.190> up<00:01:28.369> into

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
something that you need to build up into

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.210 
something that you need to build up into
your<00:01:28.790> system<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:30.229> don't<00:01:30.409> have<00:01:30.590> any<00:01:30.770> cute

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
your system so they don't have any cute

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.039 
your system so they don't have any cute
acting<00:01:31.549> effects<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.390> think<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:32.780> really

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
acting effects but I think it's really

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.480 
acting effects but I think it's really
important<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.590> they<00:01:33.920> put<00:01:34.130> these<00:01:34.280> two

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
important that they put these two

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.440 
important that they put these two
products<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.240> pre-workout<00:01:35.810> because<00:01:36.229> any

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
products in the pre-workout because any

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
products in the pre-workout because any
performance<00:01:38.450> money<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.810> athlete<00:01:39.260> really

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
performance money the athlete really

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.560 
performance money the athlete really
should<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.860> taking<00:01:40.250> these<00:01:40.369> everyday<00:01:41.119> anyhow

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
should be taking these everyday anyhow

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.170 
should be taking these everyday anyhow
which<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:41.990> know<00:01:42.049> myself<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.830> am<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.729> what<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:43.909> did

which I know myself I am so what I did

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.660 
which I know myself I am so what I did
when<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.450> took<00:01:44.570> Tier<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.049> was<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:46.009> actually<00:01:46.220> just

when I took Tier one was I actually just

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.149 
when I took Tier one was I actually just
replaced<00:01:47.150> my<00:01:47.299> preteen<00:01:47.869> my<00:01:48.080> beta<00:01:48.320> alanine<00:01:48.860> on

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
replaced my preteen my beta alanine on

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.890 
replaced my preteen my beta alanine on
the<00:01:49.280> base<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:49.729> worked<00:01:50.060> out<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.570> tier

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
the base that I worked out with the tier

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.350 
the base that I worked out with the tier
