Harry came across as petulant and angry
all<00:03:10.959> time<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.380> think<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.100> wrongly<00:03:12.280> said<00:03:12.519> well<00:03:12.640> if

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
all time I think I wrongly said well if

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.180 
all time I think I wrongly said well if
people<00:03:13.480> can't<00:03:14.140> understand

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
people can't understand

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.190 
people can't understand
Harry's<00:03:15.970> anger<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.690> book<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.080> they

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
Harry's anger in this book then they

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.330 
Harry's anger in this book then they
don't<00:03:17.320> understand<00:03:17.830> them<00:03:17.920> they<00:03:18.040> haven't<00:03:18.190> read

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
don't understand them they haven't read

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.650 
don't understand them they haven't read
the<00:03:18.459> other<00:03:18.580> books<00:03:18.640> properly<00:03:18.940> they<00:03:19.390> haven't

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the other books properly they haven't

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.880 
the other books properly they haven't
grasped<00:03:20.049> what<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> other<00:03:20.500> most<00:03:20.709> have

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
grasped what the other most have

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.470 
grasped what the other most have
actually<00:03:21.160> meant<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.880> what's<00:03:22.090> happened<00:03:22.390> in

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
actually meant and what's happened in

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.840 
actually meant and what's happened in
them<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:23.410> think<00:03:24.100> that's<00:03:24.220> actually<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:24.820> I

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
them I think that's actually right so I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.970 
them I think that's actually right so I
love<00:03:25.420> Harry<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:25.959> film<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.590> think<00:03:26.860> my

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
love Harry in this film and I think my

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.370 
love Harry in this film and I think my
natural<00:03:27.370> inclination<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.170> sort<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.200> move

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
natural inclination is to sort of move

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.740 
natural inclination is to sort of move
towards<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> darkness<00:03:31.209> when<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.360> act<00:03:31.540> I

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
towards that darkness when I act I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.750 
towards that darkness when I act I
really<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.170> enjoy<00:03:32.410> playing<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.250> darker<00:03:33.580> sides

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
really I enjoy playing the darker sides

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.160 
really I enjoy playing the darker sides
of<00:03:33.910> characters<00:03:34.269> probably<00:03:34.690> more<00:03:34.870> than<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.110> do

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
of characters probably more than I do

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.550 
of characters probably more than I do
the<00:03:35.470> sort<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.860> lighter<00:03:36.070> side<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.380> see

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the sort of lighter side and when we see

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.820 
the sort of lighter side and when we see
you<00:03:38.709> look<00:03:38.860> nixed<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.370> Australia<00:03:40.019> why<00:03:41.019> ain't<00:03:41.380> we

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
you look nixed in Australia why ain't we

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.979 
you look nixed in Australia why ain't we
if<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.910> know<00:03:43.299> what<00:03:43.390> they<00:03:43.450> look<00:03:43.600> like<00:03:43.630> an<00:03:43.870> eel

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
if you know what they look like an eel

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.240 
if you know what they look like an eel
