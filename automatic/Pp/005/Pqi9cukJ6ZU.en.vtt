00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.430 
divine so I guess I just have to you
know<00:04:38.000> hopefully<00:04:38.419> my<00:04:38.660> look<00:04:38.840> is<00:04:38.990> good<00:04:39.199> and<00:04:39.380> I

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
know hopefully my look is good and I

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.499 
know hopefully my look is good and I
pull<00:04:39.650> again<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.280> start<00:04:40.580> adding<00:04:41.120> up<00:04:41.240> soul

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
pull again and start adding up soul

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.800 
pull again and start adding up soul
stones<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:42.020> way<00:04:42.199> so<00:04:42.259> he's<00:04:42.919> probably<00:04:43.810> unless

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
stones that way so he's probably unless

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.379 
stones that way so he's probably unless
I'm<00:04:44.990> lucky<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:45.409> don't<00:04:45.560> see<00:04:45.979> him<00:04:46.250> being<00:04:47.030> four

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
I'm lucky I don't see him being four

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.140 
I'm lucky I don't see him being four
stars<00:04:47.659> for<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:47.990> while<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.460> mean<00:04:49.820> he's<00:04:49.970> really

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
stars for a while so I mean he's really

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.680 
stars for a while so I mean he's really
good<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:51.470> because<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.159> he<00:04:52.639> might<00:04:53.419> get

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
good but because of that he might get

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.110 
good but because of that he might get
replaced<00:04:54.530> if<00:04:54.949> some<00:04:55.340> of<00:04:55.460> my<00:04:55.550> other<00:04:55.729> heroes
