00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
your plane okay look I think in a game

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
your plane okay look I think in a game
in<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> game<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.640> say<00:00:53.880> you<00:00:54.420> know

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
in a game like this and we say you know

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.310 
in a game like this and we say you know
with<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.720> being<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:56.420> scada<00:00:57.420> mukul<00:00:57.810> dhabi<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
with it being a scada mukul dhabi and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
with it being a scada mukul dhabi and
obviously<00:00:58.790> from<00:00:59.790> a<00:00:59.880> Canadian<00:01:00.360> perspective

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
obviously from a Canadian perspective

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.329 
obviously from a Canadian perspective
the<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.730> great<00:01:02.730> deal<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the a great deal of

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.179 
the a great deal of
emphasis<00:01:05.329> on<00:01:05.359> their<00:01:05.719> skin<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.560> becomes<00:01:06.950> a

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
emphasis on their skin so it becomes a

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.249 
emphasis on their skin so it becomes a
big<00:01:07.399> game<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.850> in<00:01:07.939> big<00:01:08.119> game<00:01:08.359> usually<00:01:08.869> big

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
big game and in big game usually big

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.319 
big game and in big game usually big
players<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.799> ones<00:01:09.859> who<00:01:10.189> have<00:01:10.939> produced

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
players are the ones who have produced

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.880 
players are the ones who have produced
and<00:01:11.539> Sinclair's<00:01:12.020> one<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.289> them<00:01:12.409> she's<00:01:12.619> one<00:01:12.770> of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
and Sinclair's one of them she's one of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
and Sinclair's one of them she's one of
the<00:01:12.950> best<00:01:12.979> players<00:01:13.429> in<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.549> world<00:01:13.609> so<00:01:14.479> from

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the best players in the world so from

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.679 
the best players in the world so from
our<00:01:14.899> perspective<00:01:15.140> she's<00:01:16.240> obviously<00:01:17.240> their

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
our perspective she's obviously their

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.450 
our perspective she's obviously their
key<00:01:17.990> player<00:01:18.289> than<00:01:18.590> something<00:01:18.829> that<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.250> know

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
key player than something that we know

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.449 
key player than something that we know
we<00:01:20.000> need<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.329> really<00:01:20.780> March<00:01:21.649> mostly<00:01:22.250> and

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
we need to really March mostly and

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.559 
we need to really March mostly and
really<00:01:23.149> need<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.509> make<00:01:23.689> sure<00:01:23.719> we<00:01:23.929> fighter<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
really need to make sure we fighter and

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.669 
really need to make sure we fighter and
eliminate<00:01:26.569> from<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.869> game<00:01:27.049> as<00:01:27.200> much<00:01:27.409> as<00:01:27.560> we

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
eliminate from the game as much as we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.949 
eliminate from the game as much as we
can<00:01:27.859> I<00:01:28.310> think<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:29.240> just<00:01:29.390> shows<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
can I think it just shows you the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.840 
can I think it just shows you the
progress<00:01:30.469> that<00:01:30.709> the<00:01:30.979> game<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.340> made<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.729> it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
progress that the game is made and it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.270 
progress that the game is made and it
just<00:01:32.060> shows<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.770> popularity<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:34.039> both

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
just shows that the popularity of both

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.429 
just shows that the popularity of both
the<00:01:34.490> game<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.729> both<00:01:35.569> of<00:01:35.600> these<00:01:35.899> national

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
the game and both of these national

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.559 
the game and both of these national
teams<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.429> think<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.849> also<00:01:37.880> highlights

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
teams and I think it also highlights

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.919 
teams and I think it also highlights
again<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:40.069> great<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.789> great<00:01:41.299> thing<00:01:41.659> when<00:01:41.840> you

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
again that great a great thing when you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:43.990 
again that great a great thing when you
have<00:01:42.079> a<00:01:42.110> rival<00:01:42.739> Lynn<00:01:42.950> where<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.579> have<00:01:43.729> two

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
have a rival Lynn where you have two

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.330 
have a rival Lynn where you have two
teams<00:01:44.299> who<00:01:44.630> are<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:46.659> course<00:01:47.659> together<00:01:48.140> in<00:01:48.679> the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
teams who are and course together in the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.669 
teams who are and course together in the
level<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.989> probability<00:01:50.989> so<00:01:51.229> that<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.530> know

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
level of probability so that you know

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.039 
level of probability so that you know
that<00:01:51.890> there's<00:01:52.069> a<00:01:52.129> real<00:01:52.340> contest<00:01:52.849> at<00:01:53.090> stake<00:01:53.329> so

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
that there's a real contest at stake so

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.410 
that there's a real contest at stake so
you<00:01:54.379> know<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:54.530> just<00:01:54.860> think<00:01:55.069> it<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.209> great

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
you know I just think it it's a great

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.969 
you know I just think it it's a great
thing<00:01:56.629> for<00:01:56.689> women's<00:01:57.110> football<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.619> this<00:01:57.739> game

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
thing for women's football at this game

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.069 
thing for women's football at this game
not<00:01:58.549> just<00:01:58.579> just<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.179> dope<00:01:59.450> it's<00:01:59.689> all<00:01:59.869> about

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
not just just so dope it's all about

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.709 
not just just so dope it's all about
within<00:02:00.379> a<00:02:00.560> no<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:00.890> apparently<00:02:01.629> it's<00:02:02.629> a

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
within a no and apparently it's a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.449 
within a no and apparently it's a
learning<00:02:02.959> experience<00:02:03.140> for<00:02:03.590> me<00:02:03.829> because<00:02:03.860> every

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
learning experience for me because every

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.459 
learning experience for me because every
game<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.700> were<00:02:04.969> playing<00:02:05.239> this<00:02:05.420> year<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.319> at

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
game that were playing this year and at

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.529 
game that were playing this year and at
this<00:02:06.590> particular<00:02:06.799> point<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.489> the<00:02:07.579> sake<00:02:07.819> I'm

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
this particular point in the sake I'm

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.270 
this particular point in the sake I'm
sort<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.989> still<00:02:09.259> track<00:02:09.560> I'm<00:02:09.739> still<00:02:09.979> finding

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
sort of still track I'm still finding

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.670 
sort of still track I'm still finding
out<00:02:10.549> things<00:02:10.789> about<00:02:11.000> individual<00:02:11.810> players<00:02:12.079> and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
out things about individual players and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.440 
out things about individual players and
I'm<00:02:12.829> still<00:02:13.069> think<00:02:13.370> finding<00:02:13.850> out<00:02:14.000> things<00:02:14.239> about

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
I'm still think finding out things about

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.930 
I'm still think finding out things about
team<00:02:15.079> some<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.650> restraint<00:02:16.489> some<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
team some of the restraint some of the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360 
team some of the restraint some of the
weaknesses<00:02:17.120> stuff<00:02:17.690> we<00:02:17.989> need<00:02:18.139> to<00:02:18.170> work<00:02:18.440> on<00:02:18.620> so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
weaknesses stuff we need to work on so

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.140 
weaknesses stuff we need to work on so
from<00:02:19.579> that<00:02:19.609> perspective

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.589 

it's<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.409> learning<00:02:23.650> experience<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.599> it's

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
it's it's a learning experience but it's

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.819 
it's it's a learning experience but it's
also<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.799> again<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:28.810> international<00:02:29.500> game<00:02:29.680> in

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
also just again an international game in

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.130 
also just again an international game in
it<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.129> in<00:02:31.000> every<00:02:31.299> international<00:02:31.629> game<00:02:31.989> is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
it and in every international game is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.440 
it and in every international game is
important<00:02:32.650> because<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.280> don't<00:02:33.489> clear<00:02:34.239> that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
important because you don't clear that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.789 
important because you don't clear that
many<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.870> don't<00:02:34.900> often<00:02:35.290> play<00:02:35.620> them

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
many you don't often play them

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.100 
many you don't often play them
consistently<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.180> when<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> do<00:02:37.659> for<00:02:37.900> them

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
consistently so when you do for them

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.599 
consistently so when you do for them
they<00:02:38.260> always<00:02:38.409> have<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> degree<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.069> important

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
they always have a degree of important

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.610 
they always have a degree of important
so<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:39.939> us<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.299> it's<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> balance<00:02:41.470> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
so for us it's it's the balance of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.149 
so for us it's it's the balance of
getting<00:02:42.459> another<00:02:42.640> game<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:44.560> me<00:02:44.709> again

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
getting another game and for me again

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.399 
getting another game and for me again
looking<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.579> Earth<00:02:45.730> team<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.209> see<00:02:46.420> where<00:02:47.109> that

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
looking at Earth team to see where that

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.990 
looking at Earth team to see where that
more<00:02:47.680> progress<00:02:48.420> making<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.950> also<00:02:51.340> again<00:02:51.640> for

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
more progress making and also again for

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.910 
more progress making and also again for
the<00:02:52.090> team<00:02:52.329> in<00:02:52.450> general<00:02:52.659> and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.989> players<00:02:53.260> to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the team in general and the players to

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.580 
the team in general and the players to
be<00:02:54.069> tested<00:02:54.489> in<00:02:54.609> a<00:02:54.700> big<00:02:54.849> arena<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.690> under<00:02:56.560> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
be tested in a big arena in a under a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.899 
be tested in a big arena in a under a
fairly<00:02:57.010> hostile<00:02:57.810> environment<00:02:59.639> and<00:03:00.639> I<00:03:00.700> think

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
fairly hostile environment and I think

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.030 
fairly hostile environment and I think
it's<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.120> great<00:03:01.269> when<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.690> have<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> rivalry<00:03:02.200> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
it's a great when you have a rivalry and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.080 
it's a great when you have a rivalry and
it<00:03:03.639> within<00:03:03.849> that<00:03:04.180> rival<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.349> have<00:03:05.590> some

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
it within that rival you you have some

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.179 
it within that rival you you have some
twists<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.569> it's<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:07.900> always<00:03:08.139> not<00:03:08.560> friendly

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
twists so it's not always not friendly

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.330 
twists so it's not always not friendly
things<00:03:09.879> happen<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.450> some<00:03:10.659> drama<00:03:11.220> there's<00:03:12.220> some

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
things happen to some drama there's some

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.460 
things happen to some drama there's some
injustice<00:03:12.700> as<00:03:13.180> all<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.540> not<00:03:13.989> all<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
injustice as all that not all that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.500 
injustice as all that not all that
intrigue<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:15.609> it's<00:03:15.790> valuable<00:03:15.939> for<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
intrigue I think it's valuable for the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.479 
intrigue I think it's valuable for the
women's<00:03:16.810> game<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.739> valuable<00:03:18.099> for<00:03:18.400> the

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
women's game and it's valuable for the

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.539 
women's game and it's valuable for the
CFL<00:03:18.909> of<00:03:19.000> sport<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:20.349> know<00:03:20.470> it's<00:03:21.250> much

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
CFL of sport so you know it's much

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.330 
CFL of sport so you know it's much
better<00:03:21.849> than<00:03:22.689> a<00:03:22.870> mundane<00:03:23.349> game<00:03:23.709> with<00:03:23.950> as<00:03:24.129> one

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
better than a mundane game with as one

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.789 
better than a mundane game with as one
team<00:03:24.579> may<00:03:24.790> be<00:03:24.819> dominating<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.599> other<00:03:25.780> or<00:03:26.109> with

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
team may be dominating the other or with

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.220 
team may be dominating the other or with
us<00:03:27.010> really<00:03:27.579> there's<00:03:27.819> no<00:03:28.000> age<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.720> think

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
us really there's no age to it I think

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.979 
us really there's no age to it I think
it's<00:03:29.410> always<00:03:29.680> much<00:03:30.459> much<00:03:30.760> better<00:03:31.060> when<00:03:31.870> you

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it's always much much better when you

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's always much much better when you
get<00:03:32.169> into<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.500> game<00:03:32.799> with<00:03:33.430> us<00:03:33.579> an<00:03:33.699> edge<00:03:33.879> to<00:03:33.910> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
get into a game with us an edge to the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.160 
get into a game with us an edge to the
game<00:03:34.419> and<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.379> game<00:03:35.530> tomorrow<00:03:36.010> Sarah<00:03:36.340> go<00:03:36.579> on

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930 

when<00:03:40.620> aliens<00:03:40.800> are<00:03:41.099> making<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.400> huge<00:03:41.430> deal<00:03:41.790> out

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
when aliens are making a huge deal out

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.690 
when aliens are making a huge deal out
of<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.150> game

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
of this game

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.520 
of this game
we<00:03:43.390> were<00:03:43.540> playing<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.840> window<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.200> buy<00:03:44.379> were
