thing and from my first sighting of it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.070 
thing and from my first sighting of it
which<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.200> initially<00:01:28.610> 50<00:01:29.610> maybe<00:01:30.600> around<00:01:30.720> 50

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080

which was initially 50 maybe around 50
miles<00:01:31.260> away<00:01:31.410> perhaps<00:01:31.740> 40<00:01:32.070> miles<00:01:32.220> away<00:01:32.340> from

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
miles away perhaps 40 miles away from

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.430 
miles away perhaps 40 miles away from
the<00:01:32.730> actual<00:01:33.000> object<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.990> appeared<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> be

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the actual object it appeared to be

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.660 
the actual object it appeared to be
fairly<00:01:34.710> small<00:01:35.010> but<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.280> must<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.580> been

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
fairly small but it must have been

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
fairly small but it must have been
pretty<00:01:35.940> huge<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:37.260> must<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.620> been<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:38.010> very

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pretty huge it must have been very very

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.650 
pretty huge it must have been very very
much<00:01:38.670> larger<00:01:38.910> than<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.300> thought<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> was

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
much larger than I thought it was

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.450 
much larger than I thought it was
originally<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.290> told<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.160> air-traffic

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
originally I told the air-traffic

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
originally I told the air-traffic
control<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:41.910> they<00:01:42.300> asked<00:01:42.540> me<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> size

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
control that they asked me for a size

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
control that they asked me for a size
approximately<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:43.980> said<00:01:44.550> about<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.880> size<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.150> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
approximately I said about the size of a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.740 
approximately I said about the size of a
737<00:01:46.020> perhaps<00:01:46.260> twice<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> size<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
737 perhaps twice the size but a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
737 perhaps twice the size but a
reflection<00:01:49.170> seeing<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.130> object<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:50.550> about

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
reflection seeing this object from about

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
reflection seeing this object from about
40<00:01:51.150> miles<00:01:51.330> away<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.720> must<00:01:51.900> have<00:01:52.020> been<00:01:52.280> very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
40 miles away it must have been very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480 
40 miles away it must have been very
very<00:01:53.610> much<00:01:53.730> bigger<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.200> perhaps<00:01:55.490> maybe

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
very much bigger than that perhaps maybe

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.350 
very much bigger than that perhaps maybe
a<00:01:56.580> mile<00:01:56.790> across<00:01:56.909> perhaps<00:01:57.420> were<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.470> scared<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
a mile across perhaps were you scared I

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
a mile across perhaps were you scared I

on the ground and have a cup of tea
so<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.850> appeared<00:02:06.330> as<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> solid<00:02:07.020> object<00:02:07.170> used

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so this appeared as a solid object used

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
so this appeared as a solid object used
using<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:08.039> pad<00:02:08.310> could<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> actually<00:02:08.849> draw

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
using this pad could you actually draw

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.240 
using this pad could you actually draw
for<00:02:09.929> me<00:02:10.019> what<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.229> saw<00:02:10.560> well<00:02:12.950> getting<00:02:13.950> closer

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
for me what you saw well getting closer

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.490 
for me what you saw well getting closer
to<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.610> binoculars<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.629> could<00:02:15.780> see<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.110> sort<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.409> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
to it binoculars I could see a sort of a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.509 
to it binoculars I could see a sort of a
shape<00:02:17.390> very<00:02:18.390> much<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.519> extremely

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
shape very much like this extremely

shape very much like this extremely
pointed<00:02:21.060> ring<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> long<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.720> thin<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.670> it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
pointed ring a long and thin and it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.949 
pointed ring a long and thin and it
should<00:02:23.879> be<00:02:23.940> slightly<00:02:24.090> thinner<00:02:24.390> than<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.599> but

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
should be slightly thinner than that but

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.559 
should be slightly thinner than that but
at<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.319> area<00:02:25.940> about<00:02:26.940> two-thirds<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.420> our

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
longer fuselage was pretty dark

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.240 
longer fuselage was pretty dark

what's particularly interesting about
this<00:02:38.190> case<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.600> only<00:02:39.840> did<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.110> see

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
this case is that not only did you see

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.160 
this case is that not only did you see
it<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:41.220> your<00:02:41.430> passengers<00:02:41.970> saw<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.600> indeed

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
it but your passengers saw it and indeed

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.750 
it but your passengers saw it and indeed
radar<00:02:43.680> picked<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.370> tell<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.670> about

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
radar picked it up can you tell me about

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.360
