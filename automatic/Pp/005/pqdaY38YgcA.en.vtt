one<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> things<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.420> think<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
one of the things that we think is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.629 
one of the things that we think is
unique<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.559> here<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
unique that we do here is that we use a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.910 
unique that we do here is that we use a
lot<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> hybrid<00:00:15.450> mulching<00:00:15.960> we'll<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
lot of hybrid mulching we'll have a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.720 
lot of hybrid mulching we'll have a
living<00:00:17.609> cover<00:00:18.170> and<00:00:19.170> then<00:00:19.500> within<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.980> living

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
living cover and then within that living

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.779 
living cover and then within that living
cover<00:00:21.029> crop<00:00:21.510> area<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.170> put<00:00:22.439> rows<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> plastic

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
cover crop area will put rows of plastic

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.060 
cover crop area will put rows of plastic
within<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.210> living<00:00:24.539> mulch<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.170> use<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
within a living mulch and use the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.589 
within a living mulch and use the
advantage<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> living<00:00:27.150> mulch<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.570> keep

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
advantage of the living mulch to keep

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810 
advantage of the living mulch to keep
the<00:00:27.900> plastic<00:00:28.310> covered<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> give<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the plastic covered and to give it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.930 
the plastic covered and to give it
longevity<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> also<00:00:31.050> again<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.710> make<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
longevity and also again to make it a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
longevity and also again to make it a
more<00:00:33.090> workable<00:00:33.360> environments<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.800> no

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
more workable environments there is no

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
more workable environments there is no

bare soil between those sheets of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.639 
bare soil between those sheets of
plastic<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> first<00:00:39.450> year<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.200> our

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
plastic this is the first year of our

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.670 
plastic this is the first year of our
one<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.520> our<00:00:41.700> hybrid<00:00:42.149> mulch<00:00:42.420> fields<00:00:43.020> was

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
one of our hybrid mulch fields was

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.200 
one of our hybrid mulch fields was
planted<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.280> Rye<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:46.440> October<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.910> way<00:00:48.059> we

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
planted in Rye in in October the way we

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.720 
planted in Rye in in October the way we
normally<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.100> plant

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
normally would do this is we would plant

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.260 
normally would do this is we would plant
the<00:00:50.879> whole<00:00:51.059> field<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.600> Rye<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.489> come<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the whole field in Rye and then come in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
the whole field in Rye and then come in
on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> same<00:00:54.780> day<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.170> lay<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> plastic<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
on the same day and lay the plastic this

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.950 
on the same day and lay the plastic this
year<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.000> tried<00:00:57.300> something<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
year we tried something a little

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
year we tried something a little
different<00:00:58.469> tried<00:00:58.829> planting<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> ride

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
different tried planting the ride

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
different tried planting the ride
between<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.390> rows<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.780> plastic<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
between the rows of plastic and don't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
between the rows of plastic and don't
really<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.660> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
really like that as well because you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
really like that as well because you
ended<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> band<00:01:05.760> along

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
ended up with a little bit of band along

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.410 
ended up with a little bit of band along
the<00:01:06.450> plastic<00:01:07.280> plastic<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.700> plantings

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the plastic plastic in these plantings

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.609 
the plastic plastic in these plantings
is<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:10.130> one<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> half<00:01:11.520> mil<00:01:11.909> embossed

other<00:01:15.240> colors<00:01:15.659> work<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.100> lay<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
other colors work also we lay out with a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.230 
other colors work also we lay out with a
mulch<00:01:18.330> layer<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.140> basic<00:01:19.890> most<00:01:20.220> basic<00:01:20.670> plastic

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
mulch layer that you can lay you can put

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.219 
mulch layer that you can lay you can put
down<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> raised<00:01:24.180> bed<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.810> flat<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
down it's not a raised bed it's flat on

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.240 
down it's not a raised bed it's flat on
the<00:01:25.470> ground<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.979> moisture<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:28.100> after<00:01:29.100> the

the ground for moisture and after the
fifth<00:01:29.490> year<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> plastic<00:01:30.450> amazingly<00:01:31.020> because

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
fifth year the plastic amazingly because

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.539 
fifth year the plastic amazingly because
it's<00:01:31.770> been<00:01:31.950> protected<00:01:32.520> by<00:01:32.549> covers<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> by<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
it's been protected by covers and by the

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.210 
it's been protected by covers and by the
growth<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> high<00:01:36.180> growth<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> Isles<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
growth of high growth in the Isles is

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
growth of high growth in the Isles is
very<00:01:38.610> flexible<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:40.079> through<00:01:40.320> here

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
very flexible so we come through here

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520 
very flexible so we come through here
with<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> mulch<00:01:41.070> lifter<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:42.270> comes<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.079> in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
with a mulch lifter it comes out in in

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.819 
with a mulch lifter it comes out in in
one<00:01:44.250> piece<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.360> case<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.409> planting

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
one piece in this case we're planting

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.399 
one piece in this case we're planting
tomatoes<00:01:47.009> into<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> hybrid<00:01:48.060> mulch<00:01:48.299> system<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
tomatoes into the hybrid mulch system so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.889 
tomatoes into the hybrid mulch system so
the<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.579> we'll<00:01:50.899> burn

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the way we will do this is we'll burn

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.840 
the way we will do this is we'll burn
holes<00:01:52.409> every<00:01:52.979> other<00:01:53.220> three<00:01:53.579> flip<00:01:53.880> spacing<00:01:55.850> we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
holes every other three flip spacing we

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
holes every other three flip spacing we
then<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:58.490> shovel<00:01:59.490> full<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> menorah<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
then take a shovel full of menorah and a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
then take a shovel full of menorah and a
shovel<00:02:01.500> full<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> mulch<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.579> each<00:02:02.759> side<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
shovel full of mulch on each side of the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.319 
shovel full of mulch on each side of the
hole<00:02:03.500> then<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.619> come<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> set<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> plants<00:02:06.030> with

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
hole then we come in set the plants with

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.740 
hole then we come in set the plants with
the<00:02:06.659> manure<00:02:07.409> mixed<00:02:07.680> into<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> soil<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.940> then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the manure mixed into the soil and then

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530 
the manure mixed into the soil and then
cover<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.560> plant<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.450> mow

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
cover the plant with mow
