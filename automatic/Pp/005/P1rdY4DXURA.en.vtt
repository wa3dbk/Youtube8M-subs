so this is the beginning of the Egypt
level<00:00:07.509> we<00:00:08.170> were<00:00:08.260> trying<00:00:08.500> to<00:00:08.590> sort<00:00:08.770> of<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:09.070> theme

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
level we were trying to sort of a theme

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.810 
level we were trying to sort of a theme
each<00:00:10.090> of<00:00:10.299> the<00:00:10.570> chapters<00:00:11.379> of<00:00:11.670> tomb<00:00:12.670> raider

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
each of the chapters of tomb raider

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.459 
each of the chapters of tomb raider
anniversary<00:00:13.000> around<00:00:13.599> a<00:00:13.690> sort<00:00:13.900> of<00:00:13.960> theme<00:00:14.200> and

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
anniversary around a sort of theme and

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.109 
anniversary around a sort of theme and
Egypt's<00:00:14.889> theme<00:00:15.040> sort<00:00:15.370> of<00:00:15.429> quickly<00:00:15.730> turned

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
Egypt's theme sort of quickly turned

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.780 
Egypt's theme sort of quickly turned
into<00:00:16.240> traps<00:00:16.810> became<00:00:17.680> sort<00:00:18.070> of<00:00:18.130> focus<00:00:18.550> for<00:00:18.700> the

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
into traps became sort of focus for the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.400 
into traps became sort of focus for the
level<00:00:18.939> so<00:00:19.869> this<00:00:20.470> first<00:00:20.680> area<00:00:21.100> is<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:22.300> trap<00:00:23.080> less

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
level so this first area is a trap less

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.759 
level so this first area is a trap less
as<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:24.330> sort<00:00:25.330> of<00:00:25.359> a<00:00:25.510> soft<00:00:25.930> lead<00:00:26.140> into<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.470> level

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
as a sort of a soft lead into the level

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.070 
as a sort of a soft lead into the level
but<00:00:26.949> quickly<00:00:27.340> we<00:00:27.609> ramped<00:00:27.910> up<00:00:28.090> and<00:00:28.330> have<00:00:28.869> all

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
but quickly we ramped up and have all

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.960 
but quickly we ramped up and have all
sorts<00:00:29.410> of<00:00:29.500> nasties<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.010> this<00:00:30.279> level<00:00:30.609> to<00:00:30.759> sort

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
sorts of nasties in this level to sort

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.590 
sorts of nasties in this level to sort
of<00:00:31.060> thought<00:00:31.869> Laura<00:00:32.199> every<00:00:32.619> sort<00:00:32.920> of<00:00:32.980> turn<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
the original this was this was pretty

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.229 
the original this was this was pretty
much<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.780> whole<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.649> whole<00:00:38.820> Egypt<00:00:39.820> area<00:00:40.120> was

much the whole the whole Egypt area was

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.340 
much the whole the whole Egypt area was
supposed<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:40.510> be<00:00:40.570> themed<00:00:40.809> around<00:00:40.899> there's<00:00:41.170> one

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
supposed to be themed around there's one

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.310 
supposed to be themed around there's one
one<00:00:41.710> room<00:00:42.040> and<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.690> goal<00:00:43.870> was<00:00:43.899> we're<00:00:44.230> gonna

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
one room and the goal was we're gonna

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.440 
one room and the goal was we're gonna
put<00:00:44.530> stinks<00:00:44.950> in<00:00:45.129> there's<00:00:45.760> going<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.000> be<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.149> huge

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
put stinks in there's going to be a huge

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.420 
put stinks in there's going to be a huge
door<00:00:46.870> at<00:00:47.050> one<00:00:47.200> side<00:00:47.469> that's<00:00:47.739> gonna<00:00:47.890> lead<00:00:48.219> into

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
door at one side that's gonna lead into

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.770 
door at one side that's gonna lead into
the<00:00:48.460> sanctuary<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:49.090> ski<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.510> where<00:00:49.690> you're

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
the sanctuary the ski on where you're

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.090 
the sanctuary the ski on where you're
going<00:00:49.899> to<00:00:49.960> pick<00:00:50.079> up<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.289> ski<00:00:50.500> on<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.829> that's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
going to pick up the ski on and that's

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.340 
going to pick up the ski on and that's
going<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.489> be<00:00:51.579> that<00:00:51.760> but<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.840> remember<00:00:53.140> being

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
going to be that but I remember being

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.350 
going to be that but I remember being
slightly<00:00:53.800> disappointed<00:00:54.550> by<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.730> size<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.239> the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
slightly disappointed by the size of the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.900 
slightly disappointed by the size of the
Sphinx<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.020> original<00:00:56.260> one<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.949> there

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
Sphinx in the original one and there

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.869 
Sphinx in the original one and there
that<00:00:58.329> shaped<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.739> later<00:01:00.010> level<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.640> come

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
that shaped the later level to come

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.660 
that shaped the later level to come
that's<00:01:01.719> right<00:01:01.899> we<00:01:02.769> were<00:01:02.859> remaking<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.399> we<00:01:03.460> sort

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
that's right we were remaking it we sort

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's right we were remaking it we sort
of<00:01:03.730> went<00:01:04.000> looked<00:01:04.269> at<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.509> original<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:05.019> it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
of went looked at the original and it

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.320 
of went looked at the original and it
was<00:01:05.229> sort<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.500> as<00:01:06.190> Toby<00:01:06.550> were<00:01:06.640> saying<00:01:06.850> they

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
was sort of as Toby were saying they

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.029 
was sort of as Toby were saying they
tried<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.869> cram<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> bunch<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.590> stuff<00:01:08.800> in<00:01:08.920> there

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
tried to cram a bunch of stuff in there

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.850 
tried to cram a bunch of stuff in there
like<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:09.940> know<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.330> obelisk<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.380> Sphinx

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
like you know the obelisk and the Sphinx

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.279 
like you know the obelisk and the Sphinx
in<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.069> giant<00:01:12.310> door<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.539> we<00:01:13.690> were<00:01:13.840> when<00:01:14.259> we

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
in this giant door so we were when we

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.279 
in this giant door so we were when we
were<00:01:14.679> remaking<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.970> we<00:01:16.750> wanted<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.050> sort<00:01:17.229> of

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
were remaking it we wanted to sort of

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.230 
were remaking it we wanted to sort of
add<00:01:17.470> some<00:01:17.920> symmetry<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.819> room<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.149> a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
add some symmetry to the room and a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.790 
add some symmetry to the room and a
little<00:01:19.420> bit<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.599> balance<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.440> it<00:01:20.560> didn't

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
little bit of balance to it so it didn't

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.620 
little bit of balance to it so it didn't
seem<00:01:20.979> such<00:01:21.759> like<00:01:21.910> an<00:01:22.030> architectural

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
seem such like an architectural

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.960 
seem such like an architectural
hodgepodge<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.920> we<00:01:24.069> had<00:01:24.220> we<00:01:24.369> duplicated<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
hodgepodge so we had we duplicated the

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.150 
hodgepodge so we had we duplicated the
Sphinx<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.630> put<00:01:26.080> one<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.410> other<00:01:26.530> side<00:01:26.830> and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
Sphinx and put one on the other side and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.580 
Sphinx and put one on the other side and
sort<00:01:27.369> of<00:01:27.429> blind<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.660> room<00:01:28.840> along<00:01:29.110> a<00:01:29.140> central

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
sort of blind the room along a central

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.589 
sort of blind the room along a central
axis<00:01:29.740> sort<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.310> anchored<00:01:30.670> by<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:31.030> big<00:01:31.360> pillar

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:31.599 
axis sort of anchored by that big pillar

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.839 
axis sort of anchored by that big pillar
in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.899> middle<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.280> think<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:33.640> sort<00:01:33.759> of

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:33.849 
in the middle so I think it sort of

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.040 
in the middle so I think it sort of
gives<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.239> room<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.599> little<00:01:34.780> bit<00:01:34.869> more

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
gives the room a little bit more

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.650 
gives the room a little bit more
believability<00:01:35.640> while<00:01:36.640> keeping<00:01:36.940> sort<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.450> all

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
believability while keeping sort of all

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.719 
believability while keeping sort of all
the<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.170> thematic<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.830> sort<00:01:39.069> of<00:01:39.130> important

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
the the thematic and sort of important

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.900 
the the thematic and sort of important
elements<00:01:40.509> in<00:01:40.599> there<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.860> room<00:01:42.190> literally<00:01:42.640> in

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
elements in there this room literally in

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.350 
elements in there this room literally in
the<00:01:43.030> original<00:01:43.209> I<00:01:43.539> think<00:01:43.780> was<00:01:43.929> just<00:01:44.380> sort<00:01:44.979> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the original I think was just sort of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.660 
the original I think was just sort of
four<00:01:46.360> blocks<00:01:47.110> or<00:01:47.500> something<00:01:47.649> along<00:01:48.009> each<00:01:48.310> wall

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
four blocks or something along each wall

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.719 
four blocks or something along each wall
that<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.599> had<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.929> really<00:01:50.679> really<00:01:51.099> imagine

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
that you had to really really imagine

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.290 
that you had to really really imagine
hard<00:01:52.000> was<00:01:52.420> supposed<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:53.050> be<00:01:53.170> statues<00:01:54.300> kneeling

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
hard was supposed to be statues kneeling

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.669 
hard was supposed to be statues kneeling
statues<00:01:55.750> because<00:01:55.899> obviously<00:01:56.020> based<00:01:56.440> on<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
statues because obviously based on the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.710 
statues because obviously based on the
old<00:01:56.800> Carnac<00:01:57.840> pharaohs<00:01:58.840> and<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:01.000> really<00:02:01.509> good

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
old Carnac pharaohs and it's really good

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.869 
old Carnac pharaohs and it's really good
to<00:02:01.750> see<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:01.989> you<00:02:02.319> know<00:02:02.349> actually<00:02:03.129> you<00:02:03.700> can

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
to see that you know actually you can

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.150 
to see that you know actually you can
now<00:02:04.599> who<00:02:04.899> able<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.289> do<00:02:05.470> justice<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
now who able to do justice to the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.790 
now who able to do justice to the
concept<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.700> having<00:02:06.849> these<00:02:07.200> sitting<00:02:08.200> chaps

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
concept of having these sitting chaps

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.729 
concept of having these sitting chaps
around<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.819> room<00:02:09.970> yeah<00:02:10.690> we<00:02:10.929> really<00:02:11.379> like<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
around the room yeah we really like the

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.059 
around the room yeah we really like the
idea<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.220> statues<00:02:12.670> moving<00:02:13.270> very<00:02:13.540> early

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
idea of the statues moving very early

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.179 
idea of the statues moving very early
so<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.969> sort<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.269> became<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.469> theme<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.799> how

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
so that sort of became the theme of how

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.220 
so that sort of became the theme of how
we<00:02:17.249> wanted<00:02:17.609> to<00:02:17.670> recreate<00:02:18.239> this<00:02:18.450> room<00:02:18.689> was<00:02:18.900> put

make that the focus this time so we sort

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.629 
make that the focus this time so we sort

this area the same it's pretty good

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.550 
this area the same it's pretty good
because<00:03:08.069> sam<00:03:08.340> i<00:03:08.639> think<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.389> egypt<00:03:10.109> for<00:03:10.469> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
because sam i think that egypt for the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.939 
because sam i think that egypt for the
most<00:03:10.739> part<00:03:10.919> was<00:03:11.189> sort<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.150> least<00:03:12.829> sort<00:03:13.829> of

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:13.949 
most part was sort of the least sort of

room<00:03:42.030> changed<00:03:42.449> after<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:42.750> pulled<00:03:43.500> some

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
room changed after you pulled some

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.830 
room changed after you pulled some
switch<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.340> this<00:03:44.609> case<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.030> sand<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.569> fell

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
switch in this case the sand all fell

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.449 
switch in this case the sand all fell
down<00:03:45.870> onto<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.439> bottom<00:03:46.620> room<00:03:46.949> and<00:03:47.159> actually

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
down onto the bottom room and actually

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.189 
down onto the bottom room and actually
the<00:03:47.579> cunning<00:03:47.879> thing<00:03:48.030> was<00:03:48.180> both<00:03:48.419> rooms<00:03:48.810> changed

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
the cunning thing was both rooms changed

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.659 
the cunning thing was both rooms changed
right<00:03:49.349> no<00:03:49.620> that's<00:03:49.859> Ryan<00:03:50.040> actually<00:03:50.189> because

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
right no that's Ryan actually because

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.569 
right no that's Ryan actually because
the<00:03:50.819> top<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.180> isn't<00:03:51.479> sand<00:03:52.019> anyone<00:03:52.409> have<00:03:52.590> try

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
the top one isn't sand anyone have try

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.699 
the top one isn't sand anyone have try
it<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:53.849> this<00:03:53.879> was<00:03:54.389> a<00:03:54.419> he<00:03:55.229> would<00:03:55.379> do<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.650> and

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
it so this was a he would do that and

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.890 
it so this was a he would do that and
hop<00:03:56.489> out<00:03:56.639> once<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.209> sand<00:03:57.419> had<00:03:57.569> fallen<00:03:57.780> through

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
hop out once the sand had fallen through

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.439 
hop out once the sand had fallen through
so<00:03:58.409> we<00:03:59.219> like<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.549> idea<00:03:59.579> but<00:03:59.939> we<00:04:00.209> wanted<00:04:00.389> to

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
so we like the idea but we wanted to

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.020 
so we like the idea but we wanted to
sort<00:04:00.629> of<00:04:00.750> spice<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.799> up<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.009> little<00:04:02.159> bit<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.879> we

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
sort of spice it up a little bit so we

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.809 
sort of spice it up a little bit so we
created<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.139> scare<00:04:04.650> puzzle<00:04:05.280> here<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.639> sort

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
created this scare puzzle here to sort

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.089 
created this scare puzzle here to sort
of<00:04:05.969> just<00:04:06.959> provide<00:04:07.229> a<00:04:07.259> little<00:04:07.469> bit<00:04:07.560> more<00:04:07.680> visual

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
of just provide a little bit more visual

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.999 
of just provide a little bit more visual

there's these six six blocks and you can

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720 
there's these six six blocks and you can
mountain<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.890> basically<00:04:24.100> either<00:04:24.580> a

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
mountain and it's basically either a

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.730 
mountain and it's basically either a
reward<00:04:25.330> or<00:04:25.570> punishment<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.290> actually<00:04:26.620> they

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
added a combination lock type thing to

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.330 
added a combination lock type thing to
the<00:05:03.760> door<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.330> we're<00:05:05.200> sort<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.470> was<00:05:06.190> our

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
the door and we're sort of was our

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.280 
the door and we're sort of was our
effort<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.910> both<00:05:07.240> update<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.690> room<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:07.990> also

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
effort to both update the room and also

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.190 
effort to both update the room and also
to<00:05:08.350> give<00:05:09.060> fictionally<00:05:10.060> sort<00:05:10.420> of<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.690> more

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
to give fictionally sort of a more

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.410 
to give fictionally sort of a more
meaning<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.880> actually<00:05:12.880> getting<00:05:13.060> through<00:05:13.330> the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
meaning to actually getting through the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.390 
meaning to actually getting through the
room<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.720> getting<00:05:13.990> into<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.830> next<00:05:15.190> area

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
room and getting into the next area

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.300 
room and getting into the next area
which<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.360> big<00:05:16.540> obelisk<00:05:17.020> area<00:05:17.410> sort<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:17.770> by

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
which is the big obelisk area sort of by

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.770 
which is the big obelisk area sort of by
making<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.880> more<00:05:19.090> difficult<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.600> get<00:05:19.750> into

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
making it more difficult to get into

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.060 
making it more difficult to get into
that<00:05:19.990> area<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.440> sort<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:20.650> gives<00:05:20.800> more

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
that area it sort of gives more

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.450 
that area it sort of gives more
significance<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:21.970> next<00:05:22.240> part
