00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.479
 in this tutorial I will teach you how to record cowardice to 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.910
 banks either instant benchmark banks including oclio hello 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.230
 to be used with the cdj 2000 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.320
 we see that on this track I already have set backs or recordings as well as 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.320
 local memory other key or on the right side 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.909
 we will now open the buy them to the banks on the left side we see 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.999
 that the panel is divided into two parts with the left the banks to 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.350
 right the three instant landmarks of the bank named not throw and cc I 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 triggered the daisy to show that we will see with the pen in front 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.130
 the deadline knows his accountant posts or simple 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.950
 I'm going to show you now how to create a new benchmark bank 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.060
 instantaneous 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.890
 I go to the left panel 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.400
 and I right click on the list of banks and then I choose to create 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.070
 a new instant marker bank 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 then a realistic and not create highlighted I name it and I see on 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 the right 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.859
 three new instant landmark banks creates that no longer remains 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.120
 than to record 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.270
 to show you I'm going to look for another piece that has no competitor 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.620
 the memory to record for the time 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.050
 when it is activated to have perfect curls and other cure well 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.540
 placed on the grid of times 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 I am looking to leave and I will ask by operation started 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.109
 thanks to the voice m hamburg as well as on the playstation 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.720
 for triggering 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.650
 once found the position it is now able to save the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.400
 instant landmark other clio on the course 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.350
 we see that the time and the name of the song appear 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 I'm leaning on the rails the piece elected from the delay to train 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.590
 I will now ask a magnifying glass 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.430
 and save amber with in size activated jacques hÃ©tu sister kate in 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.020
 make a perfect loop we see the loop was signed with the cone 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.530
 I was surprised by their system and we see the fn appear before the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 time it means it's a magnifying glass 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.939
 he did not change another piece 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.469
 to show you a peculiarity of the occupants 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.259
 is that we can not register different haunts of different 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.279
 pieces in the same bank 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.049
 in this case choose another piece and then I take them from their breakthrough 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.509
 to position another instant haunt of self and the other on 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.499
 these 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.679
 the name of the device 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.319
 i will now show you how it works gd triggered this 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.930
 not work and on the cdj 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.930
 you will be able to go from one piece to another with the help of patriots 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.379
 this is very convenient for very well prepared and very elaborate shows 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 combinations of terms such as Islam 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.789
 note that we can record as much as banks say that we 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:59.089
 wants 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.019
 finally to find or recall bank options since cdj 2000 and we 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.559
 will have to export them so we go on the voting list to the relevant banks 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.569
 and did a right click and actually export the list to the device 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.600
 usb 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.620
 finally to better find your cure banks since cdj 2000 you can 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.619
 add an illustration 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.559
 ask all your questions by e-mail 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.799
 to question oxnard ricort to the pioneering basics point fr
