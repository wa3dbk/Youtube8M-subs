 let yourself be guards tomorrow and promise 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 intense fighting between superheroes 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 and villains of the dc universe with a large 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.360
 variety of resources that alter the struggle 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.190
 the game also features great characters from 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 a story mode that will surely please 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.059
 to comic book fans 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800

 in online mode with a chance of victory

 check out the following tips and train 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:57.000
 rather go to the tutorial go to a 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.739
 online combat without going through the tutorial 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 is an error that certainly will not return to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 happen the level of players is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 high and any button pressed 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.280
 may mislead 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 all their performance in the fight studies 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.439
 main defense techniques blows 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 interaction with the scenario and possibility 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 pigeons in training mode to reach the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.890
 game dominating the controls train the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.630
 combos 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 the amount of blood taken from 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 simpler spells is similar to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.780
 power of direct blows florise 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.360
 whenever the next opponent runs 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.920
 as a sequence of kicks and punches to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 result in greater damage 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.820
 a well-applied scoring sequence 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.840
 cause great damage and decreases 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.840
 defense possibilities 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.109
 technical and indefensible 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 enough questioned with many 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.810
 players because it is considered a 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.819
 disloyal technique 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.829
 long-range spells are part of 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.020
 the repertoire of some characters and 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.670
 should be used sparingly 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 Examples include the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.299
 movement where the aquaman gets loose 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.580
 ticket on the ground hitting the opponent 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.660
 under any part of the scenario 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.549
 that he is 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.860
 it is worth noting that the use of 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.519
 blows or mage of the type will transform 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.220
 in real interaction with the 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.840
 scenario 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.000
 the main difference from where 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 cities with this interaction with the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.280
 setting groups are available 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.900
 spheres cars ships and more a series of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.269
 elements that can be used to 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.120
 cause greater damage to the opponent 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.769
 press r 1 or r has always been close 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.590
 available sites to generate the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:47.870
 interaction special scams apply 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 special blows and did not justify much more 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.799
 complicated than in the famous is that this 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.239
 king of the recent deadly kombat 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.280
 the fact is given by few 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.150
 seconds to make the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.769
 defense 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.859
 being the majority of the blows applied 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.690
 by the most enthusiastic players prioritizes 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.549
 use the special attack after a 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.620
 The scoring sequence was the opponent 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.150
 without the possibility of defending 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.430
 make sure your character 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.989
 range to effect movement 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.239
 in the distance you will find the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.329
 opponent and does his best not to 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.329
 err 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.700
 changing environment 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.680
 most of the scenarios available 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.900
 by an environment exchange system and 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.299
 cause considerable damage to the 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.069
 opponent to the end of the screen and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.260
 the film powerful blow that will play 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.090
 out of the scenery the movement generates 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.159
 countless damages that when added together 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:57.489
 a difference in the final result 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:59.410
 the group of characters 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.200
 we can classify the characters of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.459
 Indians, but two types with agility and 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.620
 with brute force 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.690
 the damage caused by a direct blow from BM 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.690
 is as strong as a special feature 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.920
 used by the exterminator 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.959
 identify in your style of play if 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.700
 You prefer frank fighting with 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:22.780
 long-distance inves- 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:23.919
 choose your character meter 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.930
 powers 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.660
 one of the most fun 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.320
 game is a charm of powers 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.960
 available whenever two 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.539
 players blow at the same time the system 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.099
 functions as a bet requiring that the 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.590
 player to identify your power bar 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.820
 then makes a bet against the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.800
 opponent's belly 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.800
 who bets a larger amount wins 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.099
