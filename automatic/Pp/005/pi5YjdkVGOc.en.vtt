00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.809
 I have a friend 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.080
 I ask them to have a child is a 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.340
 blessing yes or no 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.870
 have a child is a blessing yes or no 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 Yes and no 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.540
 because if your son comes to join you 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.270
 continue God's creation to improve 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.740
 its creation in the morning so simple 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.350
 like this when you're sweeping the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.760
 street if you're sweeping I'm not 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.940
 improving God's creation with 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.870
 permission I'll leave you more beautiful when 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.630
 you see to throw a paper in the Peruvian field 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.080
 question am I messing up I'm 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.000
 fouling God's creation and if you 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.150
 dare to pick up a garbage I'm 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.339
 aging God's creation if 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.350
 we understand the mysticism mysticism 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.010
 that exists in that attitude is wonderful 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.589
 but if your son comes to rape if your 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.260
 son comes to murder if your son comes to 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.080
 being corrupt is not a blessing is a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 curse for the world and there 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 blessings and there are curses me 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 I find a friend in the angels who 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.510
 I always ask the same question and also 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.220
 I find it very nice 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.010

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 Last I told him hey how many children you have 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.340
 the last time I spoke with you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.760

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.619

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.229
 miguelangel you know the answer from where 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.450
 I have brought those children out of 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.460
 the most adverse means of places 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.560
 criminals of places full of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.530
 evildoers people who have adopted from 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.930
 Honduras from Rwanda 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.899
 many places in the world because that is 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.390
 my heritage for humanity I'm going 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.909
 to inherit 18 lights to the world 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.460
 humanity I will deliver to the world 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.830
 beings that will illuminate the creation of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 God, if I leave you where you are, you are going to be 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.530
 a curse for the creation of God 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.319
 That is my authentic heritage. 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.420
 Peruvian mothers and fathers do not think 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.819
