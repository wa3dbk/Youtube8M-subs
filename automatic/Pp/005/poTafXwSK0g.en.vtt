00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.520 
effort not not saying we were bad but uh
no<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.690> always<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:33.930> better<00:02:34.020> we've<00:02:34.410> been

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
no we can always be better we've been

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.590 
no we can always be better we've been
playing<00:02:34.739> better<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.160> practice<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.060> think

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
playing better in practice and I think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.729 
playing better in practice and I think
we<00:02:36.720> need<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> care<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> only<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> game

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
we need to care that only to the game

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.500 
we need to care that only to the game
yeah<00:02:37.950> once<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.520> new<00:02:38.670> guy<00:02:38.820> who<00:02:38.880> still<00:02:39.270> gotta<00:02:39.390> get

used to playing with each other and
exploring<00:02:41.850> different<00:02:42.150> line<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> was<00:02:42.630> kind<00:02:42.840> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
exploring different line I was kind of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.300 
exploring different line I was kind of
in<00:02:42.930> precious<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.350> got<00:02:43.500> our<00:02:43.590> set<00:02:43.799> groups<00:02:44.070> but

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
mean you can kind of mix and match it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.090 
mean you can kind of mix and match it
but<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.049> exciting<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.620> we'll<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:49.920> have

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
