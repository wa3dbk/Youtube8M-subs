00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 I 'm in a really good mood because of that 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 sun is shining and it smells like 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.000
 spring and after summer and the birds 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 chirping and the ladybugs are running 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.090
 everywhere marco grohmann fall mad 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.350
 because I do not remember how many 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.550
 I actually left over winter 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.199
 Whenever I think arrive again 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 I I you have made to eat 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 But that's why it does not give its time 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.230
 I go the hair had beautiful me 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 made me and lÃ¶ckchen in the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890
 made hair without heat 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 and that you remembered that he 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 I had requested this one technique 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 which one in my hartmut ihne of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 last year so much 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 that I show that again under the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.180
 Of course I do because I have them 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 done anyway today and I find it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.190
 very cool 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.449
 very shortly before directly but the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 Assessment can be as good as the technique 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 will work for you 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.960
 I have naturally wavy hair in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 brevity is something stronger because me and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.149
 if they are longer that hangs 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.859
 just a bit 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 That's why I like these too 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.549
 techniques that were my hair remember 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 could be more choose the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.700
 in addition to curls very happy and hold 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 they also very good so I'm 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 certain things with this technique to 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 prevent my hair from forming 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 I do not think that anymore 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 but civilizations can go exactly what 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.119
 I do and how I do it I show 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 It's best for you to start now 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 I have wet hair here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.299
 best he insists that he is not too 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 otherwise they need to be wet 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.020
 to dry and if your hair 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.689
 you can hold rather poor socks 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 I can also listen with very dry 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.000
 Just go over here and pull her 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.000
 my usual sparkle 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.160
 and then I split a lot and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.990
 Take my pony here with purely because 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.600
 I want to lure them with me today 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.640
 turn the strand inwards or resp 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.140
 Away from the face away if you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910
 easy punishment, I'll start with myself 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.410
 small pay off to me completely 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.670
 simply with a soft celeb on the head 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 make sure you do it all over 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 then turn the donuts 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.530
 He loosely and perhaps puts it rather 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:12.840
 with hairpins stuck otherwise beats 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 that really stupid that's what you do 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.140
 then simply with the whole head 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.850
 is still having donuts upside down 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.410
 and of course the old rule applies to 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.930
 The thick lines will take away the curls 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.180
 bigger with thinner strives smaller 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 my tip namely too small strands 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:34.350
 because that only looks like it for her at the end 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:36.300
 I tried it and if you have 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 you're done sleeping 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.690
 or bridge at least five hours 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.310
 I make my stupidity can from then 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.470
 The hair is still a bit wet 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.620
 because then the curls are not so grim 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.150
 and first we take all soft 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.890
 Get out and let rubbers or staples out 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.459
 These funny ones just draw 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.459
 hang out 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.720
 when all are liberated, you hold yours 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.300
 Kordel goes hand in hand 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 the cord and pulls the hand piece for 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:19.140
 piece to the tips and there you see 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 that beautiful choose or 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.290
 Need to be curious, of course 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.330
 we also a little bit of hair foam 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.950
 ours are also really tough to choose 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.410
 do 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.270
 unlovely a knee I should think so 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.010
 Conny out of the way and fix everything here 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.900
 bit with hairspray and the result 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.230
 are definitely not perfect curls 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.700
 or waves rather voluminous ace the me 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.700
 personally very much 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.450
 if you dry your hair together 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 vices you have it those states 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.280
 they also lure a little bit 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.290
 effects are 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.540
 I like this technique very beautiful 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.030
 volume and messi do something wonderful 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.030
 to my little cave fits yes and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.760
 That was already the small technique 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 you hope you also coincidental 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.419
 curly hair helps depending on how 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.530
 you should apply it to this one 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.140
 In any case, technology in the back of your mind 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.220
 keep that it's not 100 percent 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.990
 perfect curls will be 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.970
 that was a beautiful choice but it 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.770
 will always lure imperfect 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.210
 I personally like that and I like it 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.350
 find it somehow impression and me 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.940
 find that fits today to a 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.320
 hippie hairstyle so i can do that 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.160
 recommend it to everyone so moderate 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.050
 understood 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.190
 and if you ask yourself what to do now 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.810
 then I make but hangers then please 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.200
 with my pony with such curly 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.970
 moult 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.410
 then I want you here a video where 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.810
 I show you what it soup of the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.940
 variants with and if now says yes 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.289
 was quite nice work really 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.910
 that is not a technique for me yet 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.200
 then i always lose you a video 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.880

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.650

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.260
