00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
its display still 10.1 inches WXGA so

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
its display still 10.1 inches WXGA so
that's<00:01:05.970> 1280<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:06.810> 800<00:01:06.990> pixels<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that's 1280 by 800 pixels which is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
that's 1280 by 800 pixels which is
actually<00:01:08.640> normed<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.510> most<00:01:09.720> 10.1

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

inch<00:01:10.590> tablets<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.369> course<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:12.000> makes<00:01:12.210> for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
inch tablets and of course it makes for

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
inch tablets and of course it makes for
some<00:01:12.540> decent<00:01:13.020> details<00:01:13.590> every<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.189> then

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
some decent details every now and then

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
some decent details every now and then
you<00:01:14.340> might<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.700> some<00:01:14.880> pixelation<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.750> when

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you might see some pixelation but when

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
you might see some pixelation but when
you're<00:01:15.960> looking<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.320> far<00:01:16.590> away<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.250> hardly

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you're looking for far away you hardly

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.080 
you're looking for far away you hardly
notice<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> plpl<00:01:19.439> s<00:01:19.650> LCD<00:01:20.310> panel<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
notice it it's a plpl s LCD panel so you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
notice it it's a plpl s LCD panel so you
get<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.750> natural<00:01:22.170> looking<00:01:22.350> color

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
get some really natural looking color

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
get some really natural looking color
it's<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:23.009> contrast<00:01:23.460> ratio<00:01:23.909> also<00:01:24.479> some

it's a good contrast ratio also some

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's a good contrast ratio also some
acceptable<00:01:25.200> viewing<00:01:25.770> angles<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.340> more

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
acceptable viewing angles so it's more

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.890 
device you have the quick trees
applications<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.720> could

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
applications down here so you could

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.020

you're<00:02:45.150> doing<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:45.960> example<00:02:46.410> let's<00:02:46.560> say

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
you're doing so for example let's say

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500 
you're doing so for example let's say
you're<00:02:46.890> running<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.340> web<00:02:47.520> browser<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you're running the web browser and you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
you're running the web browser and you

want to gain access to your email right

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.400 
want to gain access to your email right
away<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> ability<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.660> do<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
away you have the ability to do that and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.410 
away you have the ability to do that and
some<00:02:52.860> are<00:02:53.010> more<00:02:53.160> practical<00:02:53.430> than<00:02:53.880> others<00:02:54.150> but

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
some are more practical than others but

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.810 
some are more practical than others but
for<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.660> most<00:02:54.780> part<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.230> find<00:02:55.530> fine<00:02:56.340> barely

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
for the most part we find fine barely
