 setinha prohibit the loose selena and then 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 served to say that there for now 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.350
 climb higher if you press the space key 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.390

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.240
 flies 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.690
 Only you have to keep holding the space. 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.180
 If you drop the space there it goes down it 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.879
 go ahead go down it has to 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.750

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.840
 It's still still 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.319
 it goes alone at one point in itself and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.000
 the commands are released and it stays in the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.670
 slack and lying is pretty cool and if

 if you press the space they will accelerate the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.190
 speed from where at the time you had 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.190
 tighten space 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.040
