that<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.110> unlocked<00:01:07.920> right<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:08.700> I've

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that I've got unlocked right now I've

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
that I've got unlocked right now I've
just<00:01:09.090> been<00:01:09.240> focusing<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.170> Ford<00:01:10.470> Mustang

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
just been focusing on this Ford Mustang

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
just been focusing on this Ford Mustang
so<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.030> seemed<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> best

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
so it seemed to have some of the best

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.249 
so it seemed to have some of the best
stats<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.670> far<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.060> any<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> cars<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.049> have

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
stats as far as any of the cars I have

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.760 
stats as far as any of the cars I have
unlocked<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.939> until<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.650> see

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
unlocked up until them so you can see

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.390 
unlocked up until them so you can see
these<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.189> haven't<00:01:20.520> unlocked

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
these I haven't unlocked

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.430 
these I haven't unlocked
so<00:01:23.090> once<00:01:23.360> you've<00:01:23.510> got<00:01:23.720> your<00:01:23.900> car<00:01:24.110> now<00:01:24.290> it's

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
so once you've got your car now it's

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.880 
so once you've got your car now it's
time<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.710> suit<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.640> up<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.300> there's<00:01:26.900> currently

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
time to suit it up so there's currently

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.450 
time to suit it up so there's currently
a<00:01:27.980> couple<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.730> slots<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.300> I've<00:01:29.420> got<00:01:29.690> rockin

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
a couple of slots that I've got rockin

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.480 
a couple of slots that I've got rockin
bring<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.090> use<00:01:32.420> special<00:01:33.160> privileges<00:01:34.160> like

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
bring in and use special privileges like

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.490 
bring in and use special privileges like
there's<00:01:34.850> an<00:01:35.150> electrostatic<00:01:35.600> field<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.410> it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
there's an electrostatic field and it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.700 
there's an electrostatic field and it
tells<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:36.830> left<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.610> does<00:01:38.140> EMP<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.470> I

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
tells you to left when it does EMP so I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.400 
tells you to left when it does EMP so I
could<00:01:40.250> deploy<00:01:40.910> these<00:01:41.210> against<00:01:41.660> other<00:01:41.870> racers

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
could deploy these against other racers

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.120 
could deploy these against other racers
or<00:01:42.710> cars<00:01:43.070> or<00:01:43.480> cops<00:01:44.480> or<00:01:44.870> whatever<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.860> kind<00:01:46.040> of

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
or cars or cops or whatever to kind of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.820 
or cars or cops or whatever to kind of
give<00:01:46.250> me<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> leg<00:01:46.760> up<00:01:46.790> there's<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.420> stun<00:01:48.020> mine<00:01:48.290> so

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
give me a leg up there's a stun mine so

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.320 
give me a leg up there's a stun mine so
it<00:01:48.950> would<00:01:49.070> kind<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.310> shut<00:01:49.550> off<00:01:49.670> their<00:01:49.880> car<00:01:50.150> for

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
it would kind of shut off their car for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.720 
it would kind of shut off their car for
a<00:01:50.390> little<00:01:50.660> bit<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.740> give<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.130> little<00:01:52.520> bit<00:01:52.640> of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
a little bit to give you a little bit of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.660 
a little bit to give you a little bit of
time<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.180> put<00:01:53.510> some<00:01:53.810> space<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:55.070> between<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
time to put some space in between you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.430 
time to put some space in between you
and<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.300> other<00:01:56.450> vehicles<00:01:56.870> so<00:01:57.080> I've<00:01:57.230> got

and the other vehicles so I've got

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.460 
and the other vehicles so I've got

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
currently turbo and mine you can also go

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.250 
currently turbo and mine you can also go
in<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.950> far<00:02:01.790> as<00:02:02.090> your<00:02:02.330> customization<00:02:03.080> go

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
things that you can use I don't really

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.040 
things that you can use I don't really
ever<00:02:08.690> mess<00:02:09.170> with<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.560> stuff<00:02:09.860> usually<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.399> just

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
ever mess with this stuff usually I just

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.390 
ever mess with this stuff usually I just
go<00:02:12.050> ahead<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.410> pick<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> car<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.040> run<00:02:13.190> with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
go ahead and pick the car and run with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.670 
go ahead and pick the car and run with
it<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> then<00:02:14.150> there's<00:02:14.510> also<00:02:14.840> performance

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
it and then there's also performance

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280 
it and then there's also performance
upgrades<00:02:16.190> with<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.150> racer<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.080> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
upgrades with the racer so you see that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.370 
upgrades with the racer so you see that
I've<00:02:18.440> purchased<00:02:18.890> all<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.550> durability

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I've purchased all the durability

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.340 
I've purchased all the durability

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
strength you can see that this is what

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.490 
strength you can see that this is what
it<00:02:24.470> cost<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.700> I'll<00:02:25.790> show<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.900> get

it cost and I'll show you how you get
these<00:02:27.800> speed<00:02:28.580> points<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.870> get<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.290> money<00:02:30.560> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
these speed points to get this money to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.229 
these speed points to get this money to
buy<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.280> stuff<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:31.880> see<00:02:32.120> that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.970 
buy all this stuff so you can see that
it's<00:02:32.360> going<00:02:32.630> up<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.989> little<00:02:33.470> bit<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.860> there's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
it's going up a little bit and there's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.940 
it's going up a little bit and there's
control<00:02:34.340> acceleration<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.209> top<00:02:35.870> speed<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
control acceleration and top speed so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.340 
control acceleration and top speed so
we'll<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.489> go<00:02:37.640> ahead<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.300> jump<00:02:38.660> into<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.080> race

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
we'll just go ahead and jump into a race

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.260 
we'll just go ahead and jump into a race
and<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.100> see<00:02:40.220> also<00:02:40.459> from<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.120> can

and you can see also from here you can

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.180 
and you can see also from here you can
also<00:02:41.450> switch<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.080> comp<00:02:42.290> career<00:02:42.560> I'll<00:02:42.980> do

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
also switch to the comp career I'll do

also switch to the comp career I'll do
another<00:02:43.400> video<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.450> bit<00:02:44.570> later<00:02:44.739> looking

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
another video a little bit later looking

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.970 
another video a little bit later looking
at<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.870> overview<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
at that so here is the overview of the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.020 
at that so here is the overview of the
map<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.950> there's<00:02:51.950> different<00:02:52.400> people<00:02:52.850> out

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
map and there's different people out

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.660 
map and there's different people out
here<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.540> could<00:02:53.930> set<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.200> my<00:02:54.290> route<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.739> them<00:02:54.920> but

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
here I could set in my route to them but

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.780 
here I could set in my route to them but
I'm<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:55.970> gonna<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.420> ahead<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.980> jump<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.220> a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.710 
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into a
race<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.930> believe<00:03:02.320> will<00:03:03.320> do<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> hot<00:03:03.739> pursuits

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
race I believe will do the hot pursuits

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.390 
race I believe will do the hot pursuits
so<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.230> get<00:03:06.470> started<00:03:06.830> I'll<00:03:06.950> go<00:03:07.100> over<00:03:07.280> a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so as we get started I'll go over a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.430 
so as we get started I'll go over a
couple<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.820> things<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.180> are<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.870> HUD<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
couple of things that are on the HUD the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.199 
couple of things that are on the HUD the
first<00:03:09.680> thing<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.130> over<00:03:10.580> on<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> right<00:03:10.880> hand

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
first thing is over on the right hand

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.330 
first thing is over on the right hand
side<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.780> our<00:03:12.050> objective<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.860> see<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.250> we

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
side is our objective you see that we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.370 
side is our objective you see that we
can<00:03:13.370> wreck<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> cop<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.360> place<00:03:14.630> gold<00:03:14.989> and

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
can wreck a cop and place gold and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.949 
can wreck a cop and place gold and
interceptor<00:03:16.190> which<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> type<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:16.880> race<00:03:17.360> now

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
interceptor which is a type of race now

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.630 
interceptor which is a type of race now
I'm<00:03:18.200> not<00:03:18.410> even<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.519> this

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
I'm not even going for that in this

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280 
I'm not even going for that in this
particular<00:03:19.940> race<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.420> didn't<00:03:20.660> even<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.989> any<00:03:21.170> of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
particular race I didn't even do any of

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.350 
particular race I didn't even do any of
those<00:03:21.410> objectives<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.970> up<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.239> you

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
those objectives so it's up to you

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.850 
those objectives so it's up to you
whether<00:03:23.570> or<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.140> want<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:24.680> them<00:03:24.830> that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
whether or not you want to do them that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.400 
whether or not you want to do them that
doesn't<00:03:25.220> stop<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.910> what<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.570> does<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:27.140> if

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
doesn't stop you what that does is if

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.190 
doesn't stop you what that does is if
you<00:03:27.820> play<00:03:28.820> out<00:03:29.030> those<00:03:29.239> objectives<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:30.019> you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
you play out those objectives if you

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.770 
you play out those objectives if you
complete<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.739> then<00:03:31.519> it's<00:03:31.730> going<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.180> unlock

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
complete that then it's going to unlock

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.830 
complete that then it's going to unlock
another<00:03:33.109> car<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:34.670> purchase

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
another car that you can then purchase

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.570 
another car that you can then purchase
in<00:03:36.019> order<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.470> purchase<00:03:36.709> vehicles<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.550> have

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
in order to purchase vehicles you have

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.750 
in order to purchase vehicles you have
to<00:03:37.940> rank<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.930> speed<00:03:39.470> points<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.489> in<00:03:40.640> order

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
to rank up the speed points so in order

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.089 
to rank up the speed points so in order
to<00:03:40.910> get<00:03:41.090> speed<00:03:41.390> points<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.110> get<00:03:42.500> them<00:03:42.769> by

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
to get speed points you get them by

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.400 
to get speed points you get them by
racing<00:03:43.760> by<00:03:43.970> placing<00:03:44.480> first<00:03:44.720> or<00:03:44.900> whatever<00:03:45.080> else

you<00:03:45.860> can<00:03:46.010> also<00:03:46.190> get<00:03:46.670> them<00:03:46.879> as<00:03:47.150> you're<00:03:47.480> racing

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
you can also get them as you're racing

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.420 
you can also get them as you're racing
along<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> way<00:03:48.349> like<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.830> drift<00:03:49.190> or

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.920 
along the way like if you drift or
whatever<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:50.150> going<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.450> give<00:03:50.629> you<00:03:50.750> some

whatever it's going to give you some

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.650 
whatever it's going to give you some
points<00:03:51.200> but<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.739> best<00:03:51.980> way<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.280> rack<00:03:52.640> up<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:53.090> ton

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
points but the best way to rack up a ton

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.110 
points but the best way to rack up a ton
of<00:03:53.690> points<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.739> get<00:03:55.099> your<00:03:55.310> heat<00:03:55.580> level<00:03:55.970> up

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
of points is to get your heat level up

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.390 
of points is to get your heat level up
as<00:03:56.420> high<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:56.750> possible<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.709> if<00:03:58.069> you've<00:03:58.220> played

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
as high as possible and if you've played

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.190 
as high as possible and if you've played
past<00:03:58.790> Need<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.060> Speed<00:03:59.269> games<00:03:59.660> then<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.989> know

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
past Need for Speed games then you know

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.309 
past Need for Speed games then you know
the<00:04:00.769> higher<00:04:01.010> your<00:04:01.489> heat<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.390> more<00:04:02.629> comps<00:04:03.170> are

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
the higher your heat the more comps are

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.720 
the higher your heat the more comps are
going<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.680> come<00:04:03.830> after<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:04.519> going<00:04:04.670> to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
going to come after you so it's going to

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.910 
going to come after you so it's going to
make<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.060> more<00:04:05.209> difficult<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.709> higher

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
make it more difficult but the higher

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.650 
make it more difficult but the higher
this<00:04:07.220> number<00:04:07.280> goes<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:08.060> almost<00:04:08.420> like<00:04:08.630> a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
this number goes it's almost like a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.080 
this number goes it's almost like a
multiplier<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.829> you're<00:04:10.040> going<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.400> be<00:04:10.579> awarded

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
multiplier so you're going to be awarded

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.140 
multiplier so you're going to be awarded
more<00:04:11.569> points<00:04:12.110> but<00:04:12.590> there's<00:04:13.130> also<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.940> risk

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
more points but there's also the risk

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.870 
more points but there's also the risk
involved<00:04:14.630> because<00:04:15.410> if<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.829> get<00:04:16.100> busted<00:04:16.370> or

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
involved because if you get busted or

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.840 
involved because if you get busted or
wrecked<00:04:17.290> with<00:04:18.290> all<00:04:18.560> those<00:04:18.829> points<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.820> lose

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
wrecked with all those points you lose

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.360 
wrecked with all those points you lose
them<00:04:20.359> all<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.109> have<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.739> bank<00:04:22.070> these

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
them all so you have to bank these
