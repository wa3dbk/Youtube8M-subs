00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.900
 leg press lying 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.440
 excellent basic muscle exercise 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 the word that works the muscles 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 hip extensor quadriceps 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:27.150
 biceps thigh and gluteus muscles 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:30.090
 perform the following but when but for you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.620
 foot shape socks shoulder width slightly 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 bend outward bend your legs and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.350
 unbend your knees should 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.570
 to be at right angles 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.250
 and at the top point without straightening your knees 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.219
 totally this can lead to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 overstrain the knee joints on 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.020
 you should not crush the platform 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.770
 toes without jerks 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.770
 smoothly 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.000
 you can use different 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.610
 foot position on the platform 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 it will give a variety and allow 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.479
 work out thinking muscle bundles you can 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 put your legs together a little wider 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.030
 turn the socks in or out 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:24.090
 need to put your feet higher on the platform 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.180
 you can shift down experimenting with 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.110
 observe different positions 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 muscle bundles are better loaded in general 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.240
 experimenting it enough 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.509
 creative exercise bend your knees under 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.270
 acute angle from again leading to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.869
 overstrain of the knee joints reduces 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 effectiveness of exercise make sure 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.369
 so that the back was pressed tightly against the back 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 during the whole movement if you 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.520
 tearing off the back increases the load 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.710
 on the spine 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.710
 we certainly don't need it 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.170
 special options for doing this 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.630
 exercises include forced 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 replays when you help yourself with your hands 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 after clean perform 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.650
 exercises can not and in such a way as 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.470
 would you prolong the approach you load more 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.569
 muscle is another option is negative 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.360
 repetition in this case you squeeze 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.610
 two feet down the platform 1 and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.590
 when you lower the platform you 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.590
 muscles work in a negative phase 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.650
 leg press though is basic 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.900
 exercise for leg muscles but fully 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.210
 replace squat he won't be able though 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.580
 there are significant advantages 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.490
 the main cathode that when performing the press 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.690
 legs lying off the load with 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.000
 lower back 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.610
 so this exercise is good for doing those 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.760
 who have not mastered squats either 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.560
 period when you rest here is heavy 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.270
 squats were at the time of rehabilitation 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.940
 after injury or to prevent 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.710
 injury anyway use it 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.960
 exercise in your training split 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.060
 Astafieva or after squats as 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.060
 extra or instead of squats 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.000
 as the main and good for you study 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.000
 could not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 good luck
