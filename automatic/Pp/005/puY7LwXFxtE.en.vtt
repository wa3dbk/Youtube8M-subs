00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello everyone is so much that it is not 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.250
 said a video I actually shot 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.690
 several videos but then I don't have them anymore 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.309
 we say edited and therefore do not have them 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.789
 we don't even have to apologize anymore 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.789
 that voice because you have the illnesses of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.430
 season I want to be a priest because I am 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 was really very inspired by a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.349
 small kit purchased a few days 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.699
 ago but I really remained 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.769
 excited 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.370
 it is this kit now me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.710
 I will move all ugly all down there 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.250
 I will now leave a picture of when I have them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 just bought 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 this kit that shows you tea too 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.190
 I found in the question of mine 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 city 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.360
 this one here and it is a to do it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.559
 Semi-permanent polish is the result 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.559
 I show you this 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.650
 this enamel is so semi-permanent 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.770
 precisely that for me it was an absolute 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.630
 novelty because ignorant in this field 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.220
 that is, I only use kiko enamels 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.290
 normal glazes and when I heard talk 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.800
 this enamel of semi-permanent polish 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.530
 he had catalyzed the oven I thought 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.190
 provided that it was reconstruction 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.050
 these things here and so I thought that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.390
 were specific treatments that 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.300
 they could only do people from 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.630
 sector of these lists things like that 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.890
 instead then intrigued by some of mine 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.450
 girlfriends I wanted to try this on 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.130
 this type of enamel own 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.899
 because it can also be done at home with 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.580
 right tricks 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.780
 I watched a few tutorials a month 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.500
 more formed 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.450
 then I found this and so I got myself 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 tested in semi-permanent polish 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.070
 this is the first time ever 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 I wear the semi-permanent polish 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.390
 this color because it was in the kit 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.130
 price but I'll show you this kit of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.190
 what was a place 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.940
 she composed of this lamp 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:14.900
 led lamp then is 240 bat 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.190
 but I know that I have heard and read that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.140
 the lamps with 46 bulbs were good 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 in this whole kit came 79 euros and 90 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.030
 therefore almost 80 euros 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.730
 and the effect will win this water after 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.910
 the plug that is attached here behind 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.440
 here at this lighthouse with this one 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.660
 this switch is there to turn off 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 lamp and the programmed lamp a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.110
 minute only 30 seconds 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.050
 there is a beep and so you understand 37 are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.270
 then thirty seconds passed by 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.910
 regarding the base and top coat has 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.680
 catalyzed 30 seconds and then if instead 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.250
 you need to channel the enamel 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.930
 colored the lamp hands go 60 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.500
 seconds so you do the whole cycle 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.050
 full 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.620
 then in the kit there was this base that 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.340
 it is used to prepare this nail here 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:26.280
 which is 3.54 milliliters 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.800
 then there was the gel and base and top coat 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.570
 this would be a transparent enamel and 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.930
 this instead is 3.69 uil i 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.440
 books this and then in full the tits 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 there was this enamel which is the obscure 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.370
 always cracks 3.69 ml this here 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.250
 little one and then there was always a little one 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.960
 cleanser that serves precisely to degrease 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.330
 the nail which is 14.6 milliliters 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.450
 then there was a bag with these pieces 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.950
 which serve for 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:09.560
 to spread the clean if then 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.560
 there was a stick I show 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:21.169
 practically this wooden stroller by 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:26.160
 rose to push either I could and then 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:29.070
 this one that would be a small one but 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.350
 to be able to file long on the surface and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.750
 then also to make us the form then for 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.650
 do the manicure before proceeding with 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.200
 the semi permanent then nothing ie there 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.110
 they are instructions and therefore this 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.380
 kit given precisely this red color 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.240
 this scarlett red that then resulted 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.669
 this would be for our gods 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.740
 I have to tell you that I did it 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.150
 four days ago and I found myself 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.760
 really very good nails 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.160
 very bright and up until this morning I was 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.380
 completely lasted will not be chipped 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.550
 nothing unfortunately due tonight 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.889
 make a retouch 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.820
 because this street was chipped here 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.010
 on the fourth day I don't know if I've been 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.340
 I was wrong, but I realized 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.820
 that while spreading the enamel in some 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.169
 zone I had made some layers a little more 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.450
 thick and advise on institutions 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.210
 to make quite subtle states 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.950
 but here I was definitely wrong 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.570
 I made a strange one a little more often for 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.979
 this be detached today after they are 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.810
 exit from the shower 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.289
 I saw that it was just missing a 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.300
 little piece here and instead here unfortunately me 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.800
 need a little long and therefore also picture 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.870
 with something imperceptible but will be a 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.050
 little bit written so in short yes 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.389
 tonight just recently I did it again 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.360
 lately the passages on the piece of 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.340
 nail that will be chipped and then 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.139
 now you see it all intact 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.150
 but on this hand and not 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.340
 made absolutely no retouching 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.080
 yet the enamel is really beautiful 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.469
 so I don't know yet 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.029
 testing but here I really remained 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.490
 thrilled by this thing that for me is 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:09.090
 an unthinkable thing to keep on enamel 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.310
 for more than two days for me it is 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.139
 unbelievable because he got caught with 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.090
 any top coat with the enamel of 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.599
 any brand based on 8 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.550
 reinforcing after what you want but yes 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.279
 it is always chipped especially on 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.650
 these two from here to a few days ago I have 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.120
 also bought this here is this 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.770
 that single polish they take 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.659
 always soap and water and to this 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:39.449
 color makes this here and there with stop 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:42.479
 7.39 see how smaller that is 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.789
 who was inside the bottle this 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.860
 stage it must re things which made my 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.909
 mother 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.889
 so now they still never have it 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.979
 promoted I must say however that I have seen gods 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.919
 tutorial to remove it and then be done 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.960
 of the acetone wraps or 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.939
 when we put the hands of acetone for 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.919
 10 15 minutes and then simply 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.689
 raising it with this round one 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.069
 push back the cuticles will stand up 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.039
 therefore innovation is precisely this 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.349
 that you should not use the socket with 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.930
 much less nina and therefore moves with 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:16.069
 ease to you left some small 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:20.490
 piece of when I went to make the gel 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:23.219
 and then I leave you with this piece of 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.360
 video and nothing I have to tell you that for 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:26.669
 now I really am 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.740
 enthusiastic of course I'll have to see when 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.960
 when i go to remove it 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.879
 but for me it's really something 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.389
 I don't know how sensational with smart 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.960
 I'll have to try other brands other things 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.050
 however with this bathing kit I am 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.789
 okay then we'll see you at 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.789
 next video hello to all
