I<00:05:22.840> have<00:05:23.840> found<00:05:24.140> no<00:05:24.470> way<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.830> fixing<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:25.760> try

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
I have found no way of fixing it of try

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.880 
I have found no way of fixing it of try
putting<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.900> nut<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.229> there<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:27.680> can't

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
putting a nut in there but you can't

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.730 
putting a nut in there but you can't
tighten<00:05:28.100> on<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.400> nut<00:05:28.580> because<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:30.500> can't

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
tighten on the nut because you can't

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.380 
tighten on the nut because you can't
tighten<00:05:30.979> on<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.250> nut<00:05:31.490> more<00:05:32.120> than<00:05:32.240> that

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
tighten on the nut more than that

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.029 
tighten on the nut more than that
because<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.900> hole<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.260> too<00:05:33.380> small<00:05:33.410> for<00:05:33.680> any

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
because that hole is too small for any

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.990 
because that hole is too small for any
