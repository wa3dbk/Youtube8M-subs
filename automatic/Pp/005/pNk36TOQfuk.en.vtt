any game on PC as maybe you already seen

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.420 
any game on PC as maybe you already seen
you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.609> pair<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:19.770> your

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
you can actually pair it with a your

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
you can actually pair it with a your
computer<00:00:20.880> through<00:00:21.029> pollutants<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:22.039> connected

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
computer through pollutants or connected

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.220 
computer through pollutants or connected
through<00:00:23.189> USB<00:00:23.430> cable<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.720> don't<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.050> any

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
through USB cable and you don't need any

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.910 
through USB cable and you don't need any
drivers<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.420> this<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> connection<00:00:28.560> will

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
drivers but this kind of connection will

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.889 
drivers but this kind of connection will
not<00:00:29.130> allow<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.730> play<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.330> games<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> um

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
not allow it to play in most games so um

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.380 
not allow it to play in most games so um
you<00:00:33.899> will<00:00:34.020> need<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.500> tool<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:35.270> maybe<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you will need to my tool or maybe a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.729 
you will need to my tool or maybe a
blade<00:00:36.750> or<00:00:36.899> somebody<00:00:37.200> will<00:00:37.290> come<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
blade or somebody will come up as a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.270 
blade or somebody will come up as a
better<00:00:38.010> version<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.079> think<00:00:40.079> mine<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
better version but I think mine is so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.459 
better version but I think mine is so
far<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> first<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.250 

essentially<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.739> works<00:00:46.980> similar<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> Xbox<00:00:48.360> 360

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
essentially it works similar to Xbox 360

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.940

you<00:01:10.350> could<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.619> connect<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you could just connect to your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.109 
you could just connect to your

this was the mini USB cable micro USB

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
this was the mini USB cable micro USB
and<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:17.580> will<00:01:18.240> glow<00:01:18.450> yellow<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.680> orange<00:01:19.890> e<00:01:20.250> when

and it will glow yellow or orange e when

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
and it will glow yellow or orange e when
it's<00:01:21.710> connected<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> isn't<00:01:23.400> charged

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's connected then if it isn't charged

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's connected then if it isn't charged
it<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.000> stop<00:01:24.360> actually<00:01:24.869> blinking<00:01:25.140> um<00:01:26.210> but

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it will stop actually blinking um but

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660 
it will stop actually blinking um but
for<00:01:27.990> purposes<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.310> prefer<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
for purposes of this I would prefer to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
for purposes of this I would prefer to
use<00:01:30.000> bluetooth<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.750> show<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
use bluetooth to show you how to do it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.410 
use bluetooth to show you how to do it
um<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.110> what<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> hold<00:01:35.579> share

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
um so what you need to do is hold share

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
um so what you need to do is hold share
button<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> PlayStation<00:01:37.860> button<00:01:38.159> together

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
button and PlayStation button together

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
button and PlayStation button together
for<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.320> five<00:01:40.680> seconds<00:01:42.350> until<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.710> starts

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
for about five seconds until it starts

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.350 
for about five seconds until it starts
blinking<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.380> after<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> add<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
blinking and after that you can add a

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.920 
blinking and after that you can add a
Bluetooth<00:01:48.360> device

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
Bluetooth device

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.670 
Bluetooth device
um<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.409> then<00:01:53.450> pair<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.350> computer

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
um and then pair it with your computer

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.709 
um and then pair it with your computer
it<00:01:56.399> should<00:01:56.640> start<00:01:57.060> glowing<00:01:57.509> umm<00:01:58.939> solid<00:01:59.939> color

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it should start glowing umm solid color

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.280 
it should start glowing umm solid color
now<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:03.180> means<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.630> almost<00:02:03.780> paired

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
now and that means it's almost paired

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.819 
now and that means it's almost paired
and<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.850> paired<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.229> close<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and now it is paired so I can close this

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.070 
and now it is paired so I can close this
and<00:02:08.569> as<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:11.220> shows<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.580> here

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and as you can see it shows up here

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.110 
and as you can see it shows up here
as<00:02:13.440> wireless<00:02:14.340> controller<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.540> control

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
as wireless controller you can control

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.440 
as wireless controller you can control
some<00:02:18.120> buttons<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:19.260> work<00:02:19.640> except<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
some buttons they all work except the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
some buttons they all work except the
axis<00:02:21.990> are<00:02:22.200> not<00:02:22.230> mapped<00:02:22.650> correctly<00:02:23.120> why<00:02:24.120> an

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
axis are not mapped correctly why an

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.560 
axis are not mapped correctly why an
excitation<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.530> triggers<00:02:26.010> which<00:02:26.310> is

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
excitation are on triggers which is

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.660 
excitation are on triggers which is
weird<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:29.220> axis<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.000> stick<00:02:30.330> um

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
weird and that axis is a right stick um

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.690 
weird and that axis is a right stick um
and<00:02:34.520> now<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> need<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:38.490> need

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
and now what you need to do is you need

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.420 
and now what you need to do is you need
to<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.330> only<00:02:39.510> once<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.080> go<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.410> my<00:02:40.830> tool<00:02:41.100> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to do it only once you go to my tool and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.700 
to do it only once you go to my tool and
go<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> virtual<00:02:42.930> buzz<00:02:43.140> driver<00:02:43.440> folder<00:02:43.710> and

hopefully<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.620> future<00:04:40.250> it's<00:04:41.250> possible<00:04:41.760> to

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
that's pretty much it it's only have to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.050 
that's pretty much it it's only have to
do<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.310> now<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:53.960> any<00:04:54.960> game<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:56.160> receives<00:04:56.760> X

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060
