00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.900
 hello to all and zig today we get 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.210
 found for a new video 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.130
 commented on black up of a new 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.960
 video yes it's been a long time since I've 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.210
 not done I know it I'm sorry but 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.480
 I was not bad at the moment and 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.189
 it remains to continue so 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.930
 there is going to be maybe a little bit more rhythm 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.290
 weak for the few weeks to 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.050
 come on but do not worry it'll come 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.309
 It's coming I'm here I'm here 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.199
 I am present at the level of presence 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.940
 and I'll tell you maybe a little 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.710
 in more detail we will see why it is 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.809
 a little personal characters and videos 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.150
 not convinced that you are interested in 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.860
 breeds then it's my life and my life is 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.230
 not necessarily always hectic 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.460
 Well, it's not the video, it's finally 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.190
 not the subject of the video I already speak 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.550
 in lollipop 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.820
 to say shit pardon the subject of the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.799
 video on this little gameplay on nuke 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 snipe tarnos why I choose them 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.860
 because it's short because it's 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.299
 than a second row of this first meeting 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.470
 very mean and second I do not know 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 why do I do carnage I do 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 forty-three pins in the first round 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 so that's not bad so like 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.320
 it's a short video a subject course 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.970
 it's very much the common subject 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.399
 question is call of duty ghost is 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.990
 so-called finally it's sure even painted in 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.330
 any case what is announced by the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 developers is that there will be more 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.050
 of quick score on call of duty cost and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.700
 it's a lot of talk on the internet and 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.350
 it makes me laugh it makes me laugh why 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 because everyone is in the process of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 call for duty kid then call me 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.030
 say right now I do not defend him 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 because in fact this game I'm waiting for it 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.880
 not even I'll play it as I say 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.350
 often I think that in the beginning I will 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.890
 love it and that's to restore as in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 all clubs 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.770
 just a moment it gives me and I 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.470
 will spend a little something else 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 bidule and tartempion etc 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.780
 I'm glad they have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.890
 I was holy and I am very happy 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.330
 they have mad titan I am good 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.770
 glad they have battlefield like 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.929
 that I could do something else 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.849
 that of the collar offers that from time to time 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.890
 take my head and it's not because 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.319
 that there is not going to be any price coop 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.530
 than what I played there or whatever 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.150
 either dummy or call of duty the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 snipe always takes a share 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.550
 preponderant in the good it's not going well 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 disappear 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.300
 I think it's a lot of fun too 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.360
 people that's why often he 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.489
 there have been attempts to change with 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.470
 the style on the previous call of duty 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.650
 the first to have done it is black 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.459
 ops bus trains 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.790
 ben there like that eh well they fart 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.400
 the snipe and they improved not to say 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.379
 two patch patches it was very 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.780
 very long but in the end it became 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.299
 pretty cool enough even though now 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.010
 when we fall back on black ops 1 we can 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.920
 see the difficulty that it is compared 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.659
 to a black of the web w3 is not it 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.900
 an evil personally finally on there 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.310
 will come back later 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.750
 so that's understandable we also see the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.030
 tooth blackhawks 2 they have no one 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.019
 star and star seracs so if they 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.730
 do is there are reasons 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.629
 I think there is a lot of 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.220
 people maybe they complain 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.420
 and I can understand that they have 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.400
 many people who complain 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.720
 here it is, it is a fact and it 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.349
 it's something that usually 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.609
 that very marked if infinity ward May 6 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.269
 it's either it takes a part 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.720
 preponderant 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.299
 when he talks about removing 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.680
 scop costs it's not really because in 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.599
 we can always have this night loses 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.680
 quickly i think in ghost i'm 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.569
 wrong maybe it's guesses 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.760
 nobody knows the game is not even 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.299
 finished developing we've seen videos 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.849
 etc. 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.530
 scop costs was possible except that 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.760
 in these videos there the guys he 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.799
 did not have any help at sight while 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.379
 just maybe it's always 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.609
 once again that assumptions 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.859
 maybe call of duty kid you 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.359
 will have just not slabs advised so the 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.510
 target will be hanging much less 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.370
 easily so the scop balls will be 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.930
 not impossible but it will not be the same 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.220
 thing that we have at what we have 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.739
 currently in other packages chic 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 and moreover to my memory the article 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.169
 who says who quotes the person the guy says 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.849
 there will be no quick scope as we 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.870
 can see her right now so that's 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.620
 maybe that's maybe just a 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.569
 change 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.840
 they removed the aid at sighting either 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.739
 they did like black like that they 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.250
 have added a breathing effect 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.780
 when finally from the small the little ones 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.729
 glasses that picks up a bit when we 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.090
 starts to aim for not shot 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.900
 directly and not make this club 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.880
 there may be all the time the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.460
 scop sheets aiming two 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.610
 slightly shifted pulled years we do not know 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.550
 finally we can not know it so it's 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.590
 not me I 'm dubious had in 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.970
 the expectation I expect but of a 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.550
 some side I say to myself it's good 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.050
 will allow 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.650
 what style become more complicated 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.050
 this mantra to see what are going 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.240
 hang on so they will succeed or 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.580
 not to bang on ghost 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.620
 personally on colossians on black 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.460
 ops dyed is a lot less sniper 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.490
 because it was much more 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.380
 complicated because of the beginnings a little 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.090
 complicated me I hung I 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.560
 galley I shit but in the end I 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.890
 came a good sniper on black ops 1 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.660
 and I was very happy to be 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.220
 since hen was and when I played 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.840
 to white like that there is I was playing in 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.050
 phase of post nay fear is the fact of 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.220
 snipers is pretty good I thought 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.480
 that it was all the more enjoyable so 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.700
 maybe he will be on the case on 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.320
 ghost or maybe not do you take 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.090
 not the head was waiting for the game to come out 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.640
 before making any judgment 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.470
 and you have a good game on other games in 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.510
 Waiting and if I cause you not like 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.790
 I create other games and do you 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.170
 pleasure on something else 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.030
 here is my opinion I hope it 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.140
 you will like it I hope it will open the 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.720
 some people's eyes I'm sure 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.990
 others think like me and that's so much 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.450
 better 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.450
 I tell you ciao see you later bye
