00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
before some of these corn starts getting

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.170 
before some of these corn starts getting
to<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.039> point<00:00:28.250> where<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.520> can<00:00:28.699> actually<00:00:28.849> pull

when<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:16.520> pop<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.910> season<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.330> ground<00:01:17.600> if<00:01:18.590> I

when you pop the season the ground if I
was<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.250> literally<00:01:19.789> taking<00:01:20.000> them<00:01:20.860> put

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
was you are literally taking them put

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.640 
was you are literally taking them put
four<00:01:22.160> seeds<00:01:22.460> per<00:01:23.259> square<00:01:24.259> foot<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:27.290> see<00:01:27.530> what

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
four seeds per square foot and see what

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.350 
four seeds per square foot and see what
comes<00:01:27.890> up<00:01:28.159> you<00:01:28.400> know<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.759> think<00:01:28.880> you'll<00:01:29.210> be

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
comes up you know I think you'll be

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.410 
comes up you know I think you'll be
alright<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:30.380> might<00:01:30.530> miss<00:01:30.770> out<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.330> three<00:01:32.330> to

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
alright you might miss out on three to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.120 
alright you might miss out on three to
four<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.750> them<00:01:32.869> not<00:01:32.990> popping<00:01:33.409> up<00:01:33.560> especially

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
four of them not popping up especially

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.700 
four of them not popping up especially
if<00:01:34.310> you've<00:01:34.400> got<00:01:34.490> good<00:01:34.700> seeds<00:01:35.110> my<00:01:36.110> germination

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
if you've got good seeds my germination

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.969 
if you've got good seeds my germination
rate<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.100> always<00:01:37.250> pretty<00:01:37.520> good<00:01:37.610> alone<00:01:38.979> most

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
rate is always pretty good alone most

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.260 
rate is always pretty good alone most
people<00:01:40.220> I'll<00:01:40.280> speak<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.640> how<00:01:40.729> about<00:01:40.939> same

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
people I'll speak to how about same

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.469 
people I'll speak to how about same
success<00:01:41.990> rate<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.920> I'll<00:01:43.880> tell<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.180> they<00:01:44.270> take

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
success rate and I'll tell you they take

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.560 
success rate and I'll tell you they take
off<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.689> lot<00:01:44.960> faster<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:46.329> when<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.420> do

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
off a lot faster then when you do

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.590 
off a lot faster then when you do
transplants<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.409> on<00:01:49.009> top<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:50.450> have

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
transplants and on top of that you have

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.940 
transplants and on top of that you have
a<00:01:50.630> lot<00:01:50.810> less<00:01:51.020> likely<00:01:51.259> for<00:01:51.560> them<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.770> actually

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
a lot less likely for them to actually

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.469 
a lot less likely for them to actually
go<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:54.070> council<00:01:55.070> early<00:01:55.399> if<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:55.790> want<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.149> natal

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
go to council early if you want to natal

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.370 
go to council early if you want to natal
so<00:01:57.970> want<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.030> give<00:01:59.149> out<00:01:59.329> Ches<00:02:00.110> higher<00:02:00.350> higher

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.359 

long<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.500> that's<00:02:05.620> happening<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.040> should<00:02:06.100> feel

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
long as that's happening you should feel

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.150 
long as that's happening you should feel
pretty<00:02:06.580> comfortable<00:02:06.729> with
