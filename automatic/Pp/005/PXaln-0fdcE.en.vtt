00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.339
 good guys and welcome again 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.040
 video a boxing of upper mind and in this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.580
 Occasion as I told you I would extract the iphone 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.150
 5 the unboxing of the iphone 5 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 if some already I six for tite 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.180
 you know that I have gone to the retail player 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.099
 from barcelona-the step of grace I 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.910
 I bought from there because good 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.480
 apart from that there was a lot of tail and such 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 shipping takes a lot and for the amount 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600
 of sales that and reserves that they have made and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 well anyway I bought the iphone 5 and 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 the 6 gb versions that 639 euros the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.019
 of 32 gigas and 6 769 euros and that of 64 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.640
 gigas is 869 euros so you can 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.710
 buy what you want but when I went to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.839
 bruce Tory had already been exhausted 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 other gigas singers since the 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.890
 large companies because they wanted them 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.739
 buy first and good then basically 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.739
 that and let's watch the video a box 5 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.210
 good as I promised and I said as I 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 costume 23 I bring you the unboxing of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 iPhone 5 and well here you can see the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.160
 box in the typical white box or box 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.840
 it depends on the iphone that you choose me in my 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.120
 white case because I have the iphone 5 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 white and good we're going to come for 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.610
 the sides as the name of iphone 5 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 and the manzanita as normally as it is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.140
 the design normally of all the all 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.300
 the iphones then more or less the same 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 that we all have the image of 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.950
 iphone 5 and well back we have some 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.200
 small digital instructions 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 which marks the amount of storage 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.110
 that we have a device in this case 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.420
 16 gb and will open at the beginning go 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 to cost a bit and I already tell you that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.289
 I would have previously because I needed 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 know what was inside and such and try 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.720
 some things but good what left so 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.340
 which was then the iphone 5 as 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.709
 you can see with the version is more 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.760
 metal than the previous ones before the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.650
 Previous iphone 44 will be more crystal 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.900
 basically and in this case, they have 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.310
 used quite the aluminum that was 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.019
 I really like quite a lot 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.760
 game with the macbook pro and here we have 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.260
 the audio input and the input of the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.239
 8 pin dock good and then come on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.960
 to continue opening the box we stop 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.410
 side the iphone 5 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.690
 and well let's see what's inside 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.370
 there is basically this dock with this 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.970
 support for the iphone so that it does not 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.640
 pass nothing and then here we have what 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 it would be the documentation and something else 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.260
 let's open it 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.970
 and we're going to see that inside there are 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.690
 typical tree stickers that always 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.860
 they give us the information of 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.890
 on the iphone and such and then a manual 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.780
 that comes with several with which 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.750
 characteristics that brings us the six 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.370
 well let's leave the manual and go 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.250
 to see what's still in the box 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.790
 let's take the seal bots that I 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.980
 I've tried and they sound pretty good 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.670
 the quality is very high 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.670
 he has surprised us 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.590
 for one and here they have been three years 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.890
 designing it but good and here we have 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.750
 the power adapter and the dow the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.000
 mac or pc connector to our 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.650
 device that also connects with 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.590
 the current charger and it puts us what 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.240
 we can only load it and well then 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.240
 we are the smallest of 8 pins 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.370
 and the usb entry I think it's 3.0 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.740
 well for the transmission the file 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.780
 digital 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.930
 Well, I found some small options 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.930
 as I said it is reversible good 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.549
 and let's make the box have nothing already 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.129
 the iphone 5 we can try it with the 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.280
 dock let's see that it is totally 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.280
 reversible 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.520
 I connect it on this side and now I do 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.310
 turn 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.289
 I reconnect and there is no 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.940
 problem is not like the previous 2 that 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.379
 we had to fight with him to 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.229
 can connect the doc sometimes when 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.780
 we were aware of the little symbol and good 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.610
 Here we have the pivots that have helped me 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.620
 I liked it a lot and I've tried it already 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.150
 as I said and it sounds pretty good 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.509
 I've tried it with music with drums 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.759
 quite strong as it is hard style and the 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:53.340
 they have really surprised me because there is no 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:56.130
 a lot there is not much to say with the 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.530
 poor quality not not notice the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.530
 distortion I'm pretty defined 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.340
 and well we see that here is the 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.330
 microphone and voice regulator 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.330
 of volume 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.250
 and the bodies themselves how nice that the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.560
 design is quite successful because it 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.550
 they fit quite well with our ear 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.130
 different from the previous headphones 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.539
 normal these jump better government 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.979
 they have facilitated so that nobody knows 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.560
 copy and then the iphone 5 itself that like 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.080
 I told you I really like the design 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.910
 it's quite like saying dazzling 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.130
 by the sides also the decision that 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.060
 they have pretty pretty sides a 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.870
 touch more cool and good to like 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.849
 comments the prisoner appeared the video 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.080
 subscribe and well see you in another 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.080
 good bye
