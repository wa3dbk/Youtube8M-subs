 You board does not increase 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700
 memory you get on here 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.220
 temperature will rise 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.300
 too many people date scourge frequency 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.130
 which is not increasing 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.080
 here it will only increase when you 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.140
