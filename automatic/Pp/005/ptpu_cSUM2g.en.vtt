finished doing that it's going to go
down<00:02:06.369> again<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:07.029> piston<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.500> front<00:02:08.770> Blanc

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
down again the piston in the front Blanc

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.850 
down again the piston in the front Blanc
that<00:02:09.250> will<00:02:09.520> start<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.209> go<00:02:10.420> over<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.590> Ian

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
that will start here go over and up Ian

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.309 
that will start here go over and up Ian
in<00:02:12.730> yeah<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.900> good

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.399 

but<00:02:20.319> yeah<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.939> season<00:02:22.360> also<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.079> going

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
but yeah now this season also it's going

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.210 
but yeah now this season also it's going
to<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:24.610> retracted<00:02:25.360> or<00:02:25.500> extended<00:02:26.500> depending<00:02:27.069> of

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
to be retracted or extended depending of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.740 
to be retracted or extended depending of
of<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.840> state<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.590> system<00:02:29.879> but<00:02:30.879> what's

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
of the state of the system but what's

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.050 
of the state of the system but what's
nice<00:02:32.019> about<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.379> system<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.819> uses

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
nice about this system is that it uses

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.289 
nice about this system is that it uses
the<00:02:34.269> flocking<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:35.470> give<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.159> output<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
the flocking to give the output for the

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.119 
the flocking to give the output for the
comparator<00:02:37.959> because<00:02:38.319> it's<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.010> be

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
comparator because it's going to be

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.069 
comparator because it's going to be
between<00:02:39.400> David<00:02:40.000> Spencer<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.629> in<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
between David Spencer and in the

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.080 
between David Spencer and in the
comparator<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.250> converter<00:02:42.489> King<00:02:42.790> gives

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
comparator so the converter King gives

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.380 
comparator so the converter King gives
can<00:02:43.659> give<00:02:43.840> an<00:02:44.079> output<00:02:44.549> now<00:02:45.549> when<00:02:46.060> there's<00:02:46.299> a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
can give an output now when there's a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.569 
can give an output now when there's a
bucket<00:02:46.659> over<00:02:47.019> here<00:02:47.349> it's<00:02:47.620> good<00:02:47.890> because<00:02:48.159> a

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
bucket over here it's good because a

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.089 
bucket over here it's good because a
bucket<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.209> an<00:02:49.659> attack<00:02:50.079> button<00:02:50.530> this

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
bucket is an attack button this

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.039 
bucket is an attack button this
comparator<00:02:51.670> will<00:02:51.909> only<00:02:52.150> give<00:02:52.420> an<00:02:52.599> outfit<00:02:53.019> of

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
comparator will only give an outfit of

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.920 
comparator will only give an outfit of
fun<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.980> because<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.579> phone<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.540> also

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
fun but because this phone is is also

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.319 
fun but because this phone is is also
giving<00:02:56.230> an<00:02:56.500> outfit<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> fun<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.579> compared<00:02:58.209> to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
giving an outfit a fun and compared to

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.780 
giving an outfit a fun and compared to
ease<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.810> subtract<00:02:59.319> mode<00:02:59.560> it<00:03:00.069> won't<00:03:00.459> be<00:03:00.639> able

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
ease on subtract mode it won't be able

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.920 
ease on subtract mode it won't be able
to<00:03:01.090> give<00:03:01.299> an<00:03:01.540> output<00:03:01.750> over<00:03:02.440> here<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.579> only<00:03:04.329> when

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
to give an output over here so only when

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.309 
to give an output over here so only when
we<00:03:05.379> dis<00:03:05.920> turn<00:03:06.190> into<00:03:06.639> a<00:03:06.670> water<00:03:07.329> bucket<00:03:07.569> or<00:03:07.959> lava

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
we dis turn into a water bucket or lava

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.339 
we dis turn into a water bucket or lava
bucket<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.579> going<00:03:09.879> to<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.359> unstuck

give<00:03:13.870> an<00:03:14.109> output<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.560> two<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.639> will<00:03:15.849> be<00:03:16.030> high

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
give an output of two that will be high

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.580 
give an output of two that will be high
on<00:03:16.299> dating<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.230> one<00:03:17.470> after<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:19.150> furnace<00:03:19.840> so

on dating the one after the furnace so

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890 
on dating the one after the furnace so
it<00:03:20.829> will<00:03:21.040> be<00:03:21.099> able<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.699> give<00:03:21.970> an<00:03:22.239> output<00:03:22.419> over

it will be able to give an output over

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.800 
it will be able to give an output over
there<00:03:23.079> over<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.120> when<00:03:25.120> does<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.599> is

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
there over here and when does that is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.869 
there over here and when does that is
going<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:26.290> empower<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.919> Mon<00:03:27.220> stable<00:03:27.639> that

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
going to empower this Mon stable that

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.770 
going to empower this Mon stable that
will<00:03:28.120> unlock<00:03:28.359> both<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.139> these<00:03:29.379> hoppers<00:03:29.769> but

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
will unlock both of these hoppers but

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.720 
will unlock both of these hoppers but
because<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.079> hopper<00:03:32.379> with<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.040> new<00:03:33.280> pockets

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
because the hopper with the new pockets

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.180 
because the hopper with the new pockets
is<00:03:34.290> has<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:36.269> have<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.959> new<00:03:38.169> bucket<00:03:38.379> has<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.980> go

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
is has to have the new bucket has to go

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.869 
is has to have the new bucket has to go
truth<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:39.910> help<00:03:39.940> us<00:03:40.239> beat<00:03:40.569> me<00:03:40.829> before<00:03:41.829> going<00:03:42.459> to

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
truth so help us beat me before going to

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.589 
truth so help us beat me before going to
the<00:03:43.150> dispenser<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:45.549> bucket<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.299> is

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
the dispenser the the bucket that is

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.680 
the dispenser the the bucket that is
fields<00:03:47.109> will<00:03:47.440> go<00:03:47.680> down<00:03:48.250> before<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.359> new

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
fields will go down before the new

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.629 
fields will go down before the new
bucket<00:03:49.900> arise<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.650> that's<00:03:51.129> important

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
bucket arise and that's important

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.659 
bucket arise and that's important
otherwise<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.449> system<00:03:52.629> would<00:03:53.049> break<00:03:53.669> now

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
otherwise the system would break now

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.580 
otherwise the system would break now
when<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.269> down<00:03:55.540> it's<00:03:55.750> going<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.109> be<00:03:56.260> start

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
when you go down it's going to be start

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.879 
when you go down it's going to be start
over<00:03:57.040> here<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.629> can<00:03:58.840> make<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.319> go<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> a

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
over here and you can make it go to a

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.899 
over here and you can make it go to a
fun<00:04:00.280> story<00:04:00.549> or<00:04:00.940> something<00:04:01.389> like<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.159> but<00:04:03.159> i

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
fun story or something like that but i

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.500 
fun story or something like that but i
think<00:04:04.419> that's<00:04:05.109> basically<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.560> on<00:04:05.739> also<00:04:06.510> this

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
think that's basically it on also this

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.229 
think that's basically it on also this
pistol<00:04:08.409> is<00:04:08.590> going<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.069> reset<00:04:09.459> about<00:04:09.790> by

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
pistol is going to reset about by

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.599 
pistol is going to reset about by
changing<00:04:11.079> where<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.769> redstone<00:04:12.129> is<00:04:12.220> going<00:04:12.489> to

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
changing where the redstone is going to

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.629 
changing where the redstone is going to
face<00:04:12.819> with<00:04:13.120> these<00:04:13.440> these<00:04:14.440> detector<00:04:15.099> array<00:04:15.250> so

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
face with these these detector array so

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.330 
face with these these detector array so
let<00:04:16.090> me<00:04:16.269> show<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.479> it's<00:04:16.599> working<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.919> yeah

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
let me show you it's working so yeah

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.580 
let me show you it's working so yeah
that's<00:04:21.579> pretty<00:04:21.760> nice<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.169> submit

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
that's pretty nice and you can submit

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.580 
that's pretty nice and you can submit
all<00:04:23.979> otherwise<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.240> break<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> system

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
all otherwise it can break the system

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.280 
all otherwise it can break the system
but<00:04:27.340> yeah<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:27.910> think<00:04:28.060> that's<00:04:28.570> basically<00:04:29.020> two

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
but yeah I think that's basically two

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.090 
but yeah I think that's basically two
can<00:04:29.760> close<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.940> again<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.570> first<00:04:31.810> Oh<00:04:32.139> another
