00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.660
 good morning people 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.059
 today the sun of the tractor substances does not see 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 like the inspiration in the human body 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 Let's see how the system works. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.810
 function of the respiratory system is to 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.449
 the carbon dioxide that is in the blood that is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.840
 produced by the body's metabolism by the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.789
 atmospheric oxygen for this the body 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.279
 It uses a system of pipes which lead one 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.800
 air from the external medium to the lung of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.480
 an organ that exchanges oxygen for the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 carbon dioxide in the bloodstream 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.790
 so you have several ducts right? 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 advantageous nasal pharynx 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 larynx, trachea and bronchi and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.600
 bronchioles and the common which is the organ that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 make this exchange along with that people 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 has the diaphragm and muscles 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 intercostals in this region 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.379
 points out in red that they help 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 a system injury then by the roads 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 respiratory air flows into the lungs 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.030
 exchange occurs while the muscles 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 help this process 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.290
 then as inspiration breath in the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.799
 inspiration the day farm and the muscles 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.900
 intercostals contract and increase the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.119
 thoracic cavity volume with an increase in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 the bottom of the rib cage to the lung 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.780
 I'm signing here right now it's rising 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 of volume together and increases the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.170
 his internal 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.299
 so it was pulled into the lung 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.689
 filling the alveoli to make the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.970
 gas exchange when muscles relax 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.670
 the lung returns to the nokia swap size 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.560
 back to normal and exhaust air from the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.820
 lungs 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 ok let's take a look at the ways 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 now the air has two ways 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.990
 of the respiratory tract 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 human the mouth and nose with nos 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.110
 we have cells that produce mucus and we have 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.290
 hair cells when you enter it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 nose particles of dust that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.939
 may be in the air 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.939
 they are retained at the beginning of the system 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.909
 then the entering air that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.890
 goes from the mothers it is filtered through the mouth the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.190
 process it is different we do not have 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.930
 no type of system to filter the air 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.000
 how it happened 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.340
 then the air it goes straight to the lung 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.680
 with all the particles that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.140
 They are possibly evolving oa 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.260
 after passing through the nostrils and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.870
 For as little air goes to the pharynx 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.959
 is a tube shared by the system 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.439
 respiratory and managers that the tube 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.379
 glottis allows air to pass from the pharynx 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.750
 larynx but does not allow food to pass 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.760
 the pharynx and larynx causing 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.340
 foods that go into the esophagus 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.980
 I'll show you around here in the system. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.129
 of managers such as the operation of 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.790
 glottis 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.939
 one more time after chewing now 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.519
 closes and prevents the cake from 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.230
 food to the respiratory system 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.400
 so going back here the system 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.500
 respiratory 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.079
 after the acre passed through the area 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.359
 reaches it will fall into a series of ducts 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.799
 which all have the same structure and 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.739
 which are getting smaller and smaller for 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.919
 speak until the alveoli and seduction dock 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.159
 then the bronchi and the bronchi 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.760
 at the end when the narrowing is already well 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.329
 bigger 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.669
 this entire bronchial tracheal canal is 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.530
 lined by hair cells that 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.620
 also serve to retain particles 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.000
 solid dirt dust that 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.870
 could eventually reach the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.879
 lungs 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.979
 these civilians they have movement and 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.099
 can experience these particles 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:42.199
 making an upward movement the air 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.060
 then it reaches the lungs that are the 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.340
 bodies where there will actually be 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.120
 gaseous exchange between air and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.239
 blood 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.759
 the lungs are spongy organs that 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.819
 weigh about 700 grams and in each 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:59.389
 there are millions of alveoli that 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.239
 are small aquino that promote the exchange 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.169
 gas between blood and oxygen co2 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.290
 donate 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:09.979
 how does this happen the air comes from the white 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.519
 and arrives at this structure that is the service 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:17.239
 when air enters the surface of the 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.220
 there are blood capillaries that 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.829
 they are bringing new blood 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.310
 How does this happen? 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.620
 bronchiole alveoli in the egg wall 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.139
 there is a connection of capillaries as 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.970
 shown here by these capillaries arrived 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.320
 blood and so on 2 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.050
 when he got in touch with 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.410
 surface of the hotel the 2 is passed by 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.410
 blood and co2 is expelled 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.340
 this is an artery that is bringing the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.410
 blood with the heart's co2 the lungs and 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.720
 here since it will take back the 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.430
 oxygenated blood of the lung and heart 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.760
 to be pumped into the rest of the body 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.050
 all 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.330
 here I'll give you an idea for you on 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.470
 circulatory system as approvals 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.169
 from heart 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.570
 here we can see blood as the 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.750
 co2 being pumped through the ventricle 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.750
 left from there it will pass the circulation 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.720
 pulmonary will exchange your 2 got the 2 in the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.700
 lung and will come back here on top pilot 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.250
 right after the moment between 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.460
 right and then to the situation of 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.530
 computer oxygen whole body 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.630
 this was our demonstration of the 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.880
 Today's respiratory system 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.240
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.240
 a next
