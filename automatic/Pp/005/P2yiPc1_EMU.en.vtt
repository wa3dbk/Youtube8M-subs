00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:11.840
 and the windows are the eyes of home 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.519
 there are many shapes and sizes 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.330
 normally the window frames are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.330
 Made of aluminum and pvc wood 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.690
 most of the windows in use 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.000
 currently they are from pvc this is due to 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.880
 than the high quality pvc windows 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.739
 they have exceptional qualities 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.060
 key innovations are in the new 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.060
 generation of profiles 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.010
 the pro fine pioneered the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.410
 pvc window technology is a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.320
 hive of research development and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.000
 production will already be for new advances u 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 maintenance works 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.739
 the manufacturing department of 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 profile tools takes more than 50 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.760
 years making their own dies of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 extrusion 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.930
 the mixing factory processes the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.540
 different components of the recipes 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.420
 profile including the main element 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.439
 pvc and the lead free stabilizer 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.439
 own company 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.690
 PVC can be recycled entirely the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.880
 old pvc frames are milled and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.880
 they are used again in the material cycle 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.370
 the profiles are manufactured in 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.250
 called extruders 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.620
 this is pushed into the pvc a fade by 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.620
 an opening that shapes the material 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.460
 a remarkable feature of these 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.380
 profiles its many cameras its function 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.939
 main is to provide stability and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.860
 thermal isolation 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.500
 unlike the aluminum that drives the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.390
 heat the pvc has a coefficient of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.630
 very low heat transfer 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.729
 quality has the highest priority 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
 profiles always undergo analysis 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.350
 deep in the test lab 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.690
 this special mixture makes the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.600
 profiles withstand the inclemency of 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.930
 weather, environmental effects and exposure 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.330
 uvb rays, the profiles retain their 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.490
 visual appeal 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.520
 this means that the pvc windows 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.240
 They are easy to clean and do not need 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.680
 paint unlike wood 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.590
 this tests the maximum capacity 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.570
 of material loading the attributes of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.570
 key security of pvc windows 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.570
 are its elasticity and physical resistance 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.270
 the fittings also undergo 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.580
 Load tests 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.350
 the acoustic insulation tests in 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.250
 the windows simulate such high levels 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.040
 like those of jet fighters 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.350
 The quality of a PVC window is what 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.860
 good enough only after passing 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.470
 the tests there are pvc windows in a 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.450
 wide range of colors wood streaks and 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.920
 with aluminum covers for colors 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.950
 personalized 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.140
 the pvc is easy to mold therefore the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.450
 pvc windows come in a large 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.840
 diversity of shapes and sizes as with 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.540
 round bows 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.610
 either for new or old buildings and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.940
 renewed each application has its 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.490
 custom window 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.820
 classic colors and shapes nothing is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:31.550
 Impossible pvc windows and doors 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.550
 they are quality products for every purpose
