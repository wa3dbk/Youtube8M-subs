00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.120
 hi friends this is a diary lada priora 2 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.099
 record 20 on fox hunter channel 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 and today I will talk about how to do 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 the door lock sound is somewhat quieter than 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.260
 he originally what was originally sound 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.680
 closing doors on priors 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:31.850
 resembles the sound of a fallen tin bucket 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.180
 somehow I naturally exaggerate but 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 loudly the doors slam 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.030
 listen to how they clap from the original 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
 your condition you can by going on 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 link in the description or by clicking on the button 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.949
 on the screen which now appears so 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.620
 I really enjoyed it all and I 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.489
 decided to make the sound quieter 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.109
 Well , first of all, what is going on 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.260
 the sound of the doors closing is from 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.570
 designs of the door itself to which we 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.360
 no way we can not really affect it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 there is such a second 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.799
 and it is very important insulation that is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.290
 when the door is empty she and zoning and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.560
 sound amplifies when you stick 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.520
 soundproofing plump well so then 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 Naturally the door is no longer empty and 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.369
 reasonation.com and anti-vibration 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 materials and the door is already closing 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.740
 much quieter much nicer and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 the third is the natural construction of the castle 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 so I decided not to bother much 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 about this because there are different 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 Ways to put a castle from different 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 options, I decided to buy a standard 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.220
 reception of the Riga castle 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.180
 but production 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.240
 plant about team-h then they have special 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.830
 locks 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.090
 they call them noiselessly and well i would 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.510
 said just more quiet but let's 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 let's see this here's the standard 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 Priory castle see on it 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.940
 marking 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 here stands and here it is not clear on which 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.240
 plant it is made out on the locks 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 team-h here here is marking oop team-h 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.440
 so they look exactly the same but 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.410
 different in that this construction 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.840
 the castle here it is here too 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.090
 plastic but here is metal 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.900
 there she is all plastic and in general 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.570
 just that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.660
 also included such here 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.180
 fingers up to which are actually and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.430
 the lock is shut but they are not mine 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.940
 They sat down for some reason, then that the diameter is larger 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.820
 than those that I have here is how to change 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.459
 lock and give me the box still included 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.459
 plastic apparently they, too 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.920
 called up somehow 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.709
 absorbs sound that's how to have a lock i'm 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.800
 I will not show it to you very simply 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.130
 take a star screwdriver unscrew 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.380
 two bolts all lock removed further we put 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.100
 another lock twist the two bolts all 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.830
 everything is very simple there so let me 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.660
 I'll show you how the door now opens 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.739
 and then tell you what else besides the replacement 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.739
 I made the locks 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:52.020
 and closes well of course no way 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:58.080
 foreign cars but be quiet let's look at 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.730
 lock here is a box on it is so 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.750
 everything is exactly on so here is the most interesting 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.690
 what I did for a reason lies here 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 this is electrical tape the world is not or 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:16.290
 I wound medical plaster 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:20.970
 here it is here that is unscrewed this 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.370
 here's the thing well, that is, it looks like this 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.840
 exactly the same diameter is expensive and 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:34.710
 here on this part here just 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:38.070
 slam shut reeled wind too 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.800
 do not need much because then the doors fight 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.320
 bad close and open 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 enough somewhere 2 2 and a half 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.090
 turns and all and 2 are closing already 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.150
 much quieter 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.860
 plus doors have insulation and sound 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.250
 closing the doors has become quite 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.770
 another much more pleasant but true 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.330
 on the same grants and Kalina doors all 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.280
 equal closes much better also 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.090
 there are other ways how to do 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.450
 door closing 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.350
 more quiet first people put 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.270
 volgovskih castles with a wolf but there they need 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.320
 somehow prune but information is about 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.350
 this internet and also i think you can not 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.390
 to suffer with electrical tape 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.120
 dangerous here to buy this thing just 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.320
 silicone for sure they are 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.599
 there is but I somehow did not bother here 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.219
 such cases 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.919
 here is but the most pronounced fiction leave 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.960
 not so much 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:46.029
 replaced lock how many 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.949
 insulation at the door it was all a record 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.779
