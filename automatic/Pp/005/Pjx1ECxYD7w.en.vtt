00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 I have not signed it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.460
 Zsolt Peterson dry draw MSK aka dota 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.290
 And so let's start first, but it all started with 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.150
 the remains so 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.949
 so that specific reference sq 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.780
 once on the blue hunting tribes 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.709
 men with powerful all they cleaned 

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:50.949
 abilities put on developed times reported 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.549
 naka they decided that unformed 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.259
 view you can use yourself in 

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.390
 good and steel 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.809
 manipulate its evolution but in some way 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.850
 moment it turned out that the processes of bird courts 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 and nothing from this venture will come to all in the end 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 it is necessary raised korya it was the starting 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.220
 point for bloodshed 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.890
 civil war broke out 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.490
 which tells us the map 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.369
 for starcraft called and he 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.350
 Australia further on this 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 useless card at the same time 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.830
 the opposing team was not that is 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 the hero had to fight 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600
 computer we found a certain ul he decided 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780
 shift the concept of growing genital 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.740
 lonely hero 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 innovators 3 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.329
 then still rajek halsey pagodas stood 2003 h 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.619
 this dude created dollars later 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.899
 the beauty product came out buffalo won our 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.799
 hero instead of adapting 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.039
 its under the thought of the game versions 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.979
 just superb rings in place 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:37.420
 an accident 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320
 we have the same and in a couple of years most likely ourselves 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 but the quality of the saved traps is actually what 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.490
 same happened for these passwords someone asks 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 first the fans then the score 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 not so numerous 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.850
 heavily scattered and even unsuspecting 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.810
 the existence of each other twisted card 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.830
 as they could and in every possible way edited 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.090
 changed on the Pechora outside the heroes in general yet 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.689
 a cloud of all but to the point 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.749
 no one could get and now it would seem 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.649
 time to just forget about the incomprehensible card in 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.929
 which no one really plays but here 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.490
 steve money appears on stage 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.969
 Minsk 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.280
 this guy clearly saw that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.170
 modifications for the card are vast and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.959
 Apparently the selection process for him was 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.349
 so painful that we 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.890
 everything is simple to collect all the characters in general 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 which were added dozens 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680
 versions up 5 isa their essence in one single 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.239
 the script seemed the whole thing to the point that 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.920
 Russia 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.900
 a miracle happened people approved approval then 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.989
 Something pleasant to them motivating end 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.930
 almost fig began to work on the card 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.760
 constantly complements assets 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.950
 and it was no doubt it was hard 2004 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.160
 year time when people were still watching 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.180
 TV Internet was not in every 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.110
 house asset was often a modem 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.160
 I didn't have time to hear the master 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.680
 this is no rand for free 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 spread music online no one and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.930
 could not think 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.169
 Madonna then still was nothing 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.199
 Well, what do we say 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.999
 pointing out the article is also not yet therefore miserable 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.199
 rendered had its about the site here it is 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.969
 discussed a modest ditch Chet Batumi 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.449
 tap then came to him another style no 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:01.060
 not jobs 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.340
 steve masked he is pendragon and in october 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.200
 2004 he created the site in dota allstars 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.590
 point and there further came 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.420
 all the brokers and the golden one began 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.750
 around this time appears 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.230
 all known term nickname which was 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.840
 the only entertainment for those 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 who dozens of times a day 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.160
 survived the map for warcraft and staring at 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 Myskin monitor pushes the slider 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.430
 downloads 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.170
 in the early stages of oaz ru engage in all sorts 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.780
 minor aspects while 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.989
 directly script 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.909
 optimized all the same will be in 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.450
 Further from the versions so 6 0 and Estonians are dumb 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.459
 with the processing of ideas and suggestions 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.620
 fan picketers add new 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.700
 heroes and items 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.910
 and everything seems to be working and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.620
 develops but in 2008 the ice toad states 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.460
 what's more with the spot which pentagon 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.420
 will not work and generally enough 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.010
 regulatory toads call boycott 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.900
 creates a new resource half a year point 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.470
 someone then their continues to join Lena 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.699
 everybody's beloved daughter 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.889
 sell deadline develop from already alone 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.529
 relying on a proven system 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.089
 fan response and then unexpectedly in 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.199
 October this year announcing the soligo 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.920
 wallow 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.819
 a project that steve kin himself is working on 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.119
 a year later that is October 2009 in Ufa 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.089
 dumb then from the horns to participate in the project dota 2 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.159
 and in the same October Czech 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.309
 lets out a heart game adds an answer 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.849
 Gims brought up by steve type that is a game 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.199
 genre toto but call your genre 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.079
 hryvnia the name of another game is like that 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.949
 wrong therefore ed and suggested 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.899
 alternative mob genre name 

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.130
 multiplayer online batal 1 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.050
 and sales started in October 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 windows 7 is a very good month but 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.879
 and go again in the end we have two 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.379
 developers of one game for different 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.460
 side barricades imposition created 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.580
 the very shape of the limbs 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.719
 the horns of the set of this form set 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.400
 details of flowers is all history 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.909
 adriatic but if actually all of a sudden 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.860
 and other things well, just could not not 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.409
 will result in a full-fledged war 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.240
 conservative fan 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.219
 innovators I just do not victor 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.550
 Now it happens either to beaches with when 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.460
 barn caressing half naked 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.410
 got stronger on plump acquired new 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.380
 paint woods from desert content 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.150
 products 5 and now subscribers she 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.990
 firmly seated on the market shelf 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.360
 have nowhere to go until 2 2 yet 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.380
 not yet released but has already shown all his 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.340
 the sexiest sights 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.759
 but the main advantage is that it looks like 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.060
 exactly how dota is the reincarnation of that 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.169
 most three megabytes map for warcraft 3 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.240
 plus valve claiming to justify your 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.490
 waiting at the same time 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.120
 he looks you straight in the eyes they are not about viva 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.410
 stir but now the run-up to October 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.339
 messi truly and mystical work 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.359
 for all the short term to the largest 

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.869
 tournament memory of legends with a prize fund of 5 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.029
 million dollars but slowly suitable 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:37.269
 end of 2012 which was 

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:39.129
 Announced still failed release 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.659
 dota 2 we decided to figure out what it is 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.419
 in general for games and which one is better
