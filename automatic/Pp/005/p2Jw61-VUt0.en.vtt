00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 the two Korean superpowers 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.560
 keep the Samsung and LG TV area 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 keep a close eye on each other 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 so well even the LG through 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.170
 Samsung was accused of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 corporate espionage 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 that was then about oled and it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.000
 striking was the first 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.879
 oled production models of both 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 holding 55 inch heavy with a bent 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.790
 screen 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.840
 Again it seems like they are at it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.120
 cheated each other 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.250
 because they now both come with the world 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.860
 largest uhd tv with the curved screen 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.320
 of no less than 105 inches 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 The striking thing is that they both favor it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.730
 have chosen not to attend a session 9 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 go as usual but 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 for one 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.710
 21 is on 9 model 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.070
 at the televisions have resolution of 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.110
 5120 to 2160 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.790
 we know the 21 by 9 format from the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.350
 cinema because pretty much all hollywood 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.780
 blockbusters are in this extra prepare 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.850
 format recorded with these televisions 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.490
 so possible to make this film without black 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
 bars above and below to display at 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.670
 lg tv especially falls it 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.620
 speaker system on what is still prominent 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.180
 it is present under the television 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.590
 a speaker system made by her 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.450
 mcardle 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.160
 with no less than seven point two channels 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
 and 150 watts 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.880
 the system clogs pretty pretty hard 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.229
 quite a bit of bass 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.020
 okay it wasn't good on a bus like that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.270
 listen to lg television they also provided 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.160
 from web ms with the new interface and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.600
 that too looked good already coming there 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.790
 don't really play along with that television 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.050
 and be able to say about the image quality 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.759
 yes it is just impressive 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.530
 television is big 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.619
 as far as we are concerned, this curvature is necessary 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.030
 not but this size does a lot for the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.030
 for the impression that a television makes 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.170
 have part of samsung looks very 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 tight and it is because the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.110
 speaker system clogged 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.310
 Of course it has disadvantages in the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.350
 speakers are not directly on your ears 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.880
 focused but it certainly gives it a nice look 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.170
 sleek appearance 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.110
 at the back is the television 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.459
 equipped with a type of laminate floor and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.590
 there is a gap in between and there it comes 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.700
 sound out 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.200
 the disadvantage is that the speakers 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.940
 so don't focus on your ears 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320
 having it a little less than sounding 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.209
 could not control the noise 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 was not heard at the fair 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.970
 also the image quality of the samsung 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.160
 impressive 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.260
 due to the high resolution and the large size 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.420
 but once had a bit much 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.070
 processing applied and too much champing 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.110
 and what did such a little bit 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.489
 prejudice to the presentation 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.380
 despite being those production models 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 is the target group for this type 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.100
 televisions not particularly large 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.140
 for most people it is simply 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.670
 not practically such a large television and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.500
 sometime up a staircase with something like that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.390
 television is simply impossible 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.239
 samsung hasn't announced any prices yet 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.470
 made LG though I would say begin 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.330
 stuck with saving for such 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.500
 television costs no less than seventy 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.500
 one thousand dollars
