00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.610
 Hi there, today we are making blanks 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:11.440
 green tomatoes for the winter in banks 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:14.760
 I have such tomatoes go with a bang 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.939
 added everywhere go to the fry 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:23.470
 gravy soups and pizza when only 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:29.890
 it is for this we took here such 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:36.309
 Tomatoes are washed, cut and peeled. 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:39.120
 from seeds here so we cut on 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 slices 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.960
 tomatoes cut into slices here seeds 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.550
 and seed we will boil tomato paste for 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.170
 preparations to add to soups 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 borscht about our tomatoes we are a little bit 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.630
 we add in this way and after 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.979
 leave it for an hour so they give 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.979
 excess juice 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.460
 excess moisture 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 so tomatoes stood for about an hour with them 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.440
 glass is excess moisture and now we have them 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.720
 decompose on the grid from the dryer at the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.729
 who does not have such an electric dryer 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.229
 at home you can dry the tomatoes in the oven when 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.479
 temperature of 60 degrees and at the same time 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.000
 the door must be kept slightly ajar 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:56.470
 the oven dried them hours 68 very long 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 If your oven in the oven is not available 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.160
 such a low temperature you need 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 to bring 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.670
 somewhere up to 100 degrees on and off 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 constantly turn it off of course 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:14.160
 will take more time but that way 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.990
 we lay out our tomatoes 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 our tomatoes laid out grate for 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:32.110
 dryers now we put it their style 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:35.190
 sushi so cover with a lid yet 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.740
 in the household thing of course irreplaceable and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.950
 we set the time and temperature 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.060
 set at two o'clock as the time we have 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:50.320
 later then if we continue and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.860
 temperature set 60 degrees repeat 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:01.450
 that you can dry tomatoes in simple 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.170
 ordinary oven at 60 degrees 68 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.350
 o'clock 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.880
 Well, our process went further 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.890
 let's see what happens 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.250

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:27.209
 already about 6 7 hours and the time is already coming 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.209
 the end left an hour soon will be ready 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.020
 Here is such a wonderful thing dryer 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.020
