00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
all right now we've set up all of our

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.619 
all right now we've set up all of our
reference<00:00:02.280> images<00:00:02.639> and<00:00:02.820> image<00:00:02.970> planes<00:00:03.360> to

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
reference images and image planes to

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.570 
reference images and image planes to
using<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:03.929> projects<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.980> video<00:00:05.220> we're

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
using this projects in this video we're

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.190 
using this projects in this video we're
going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.850> set<00:00:06.210> up<00:00:06.390> our<00:00:06.600> user<00:00:06.750> interface

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
going to set up our user interface

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.440 
going to set up our user interface
import<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> image<00:00:08.519> planes<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> then<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.269> want

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
import the image planes and then I want

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.730 
import the image planes and then I want
to<00:00:09.540> show<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.840> workflow<00:00:10.230> i'll<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.559> using

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
to show you the workflow i'll be using

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.980 
to show you the workflow i'll be using
in<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.070> particular<00:00:11.250> project<00:00:11.639> if<00:00:12.599> i<00:00:12.780> go<00:00:12.929> into

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
in this particular project if i go into

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.509 
in this particular project if i go into
my<00:00:13.110> source<00:00:13.410> images<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.009> double<00:00:14.280> check

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
my source images just double check

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.099 
my source images just double check
you've<00:00:14.670> got<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:15.030> your<00:00:15.059> reference<00:00:15.540> images<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you've got all your reference images and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.080 
you've got all your reference images and
image<00:00:16.320> plane<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.070> use<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:18.060> sure

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
image plane so we can use and make sure

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.820 
image plane so we can use and make sure
that<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> saved<00:00:18.750> your<00:00:18.869> PSD<00:00:19.199> file<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.770> well

that you saved your PSD file as well
just<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.670> case<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.029> need<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.270> back<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> make

interface elements in my workspace let's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520 
interface elements in my workspace let's
go<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> display<00:00:38.370> UI<00:00:39.239> elements<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.020> tear<00:00:40.410> off

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
go to display UI elements and tear off

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.340 
go to display UI elements and tear off
this<00:00:40.649> menu<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> disable<00:00:42.989> the

on<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.410> command<00:00:46.829> line<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> also

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
on that the command line and we can also

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
on that the command line and we can also
get<00:00:49.410> rid<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> time<00:00:49.860> slider<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.280> well<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
get rid of the time slider as well so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
get rid of the time slider as well so
that's<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.600> our<00:00:51.719> animation<00:00:52.379> user<00:00:52.770> interface

that's all our animation user interface

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130 
that's all our animation user interface
elements<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> we've<00:00:54.780> got<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> lot

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
elements other way and we've got a lot

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
elements other way and we've got a lot
more<00:00:55.170> space<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> model<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.250> object<00:00:56.610> let's<00:00:57.360> go

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
more space to model or object let's go

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
more space to model or object let's go
ahead<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> exit<00:00:58.199> our<00:00:58.289> UI<00:00:58.530> elements<00:00:59.129> menu<00:00:59.430> and

ahead and exit our UI elements menu and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.750 
ahead and exit our UI elements menu and
it<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.410> idea<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.579> how

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it will also be a good idea to see how

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
it will also be a good idea to see how
much<00:01:02.940> polygons<00:01:03.480> we've<00:01:03.629> modeled<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
much polygons we've modeled in the

process of our modeling to see this we
can<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> display<00:01:08.060> heads-up<00:01:09.060> display<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
can go to display heads-up display and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.679 
can go to display heads-up display and
turn<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.619> polycount<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> top

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
turn on the polycount and at the top

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
turn on the polycount and at the top
left<00:01:12.960> hand<00:01:13.080> side<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.590> our<00:01:13.650> viewport<00:01:14.100> we've<00:01:14.640> now

left hand side of our viewport we've now

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
left hand side of our viewport we've now
got<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.240> many<00:01:15.360> vertices<00:01:15.659> edges<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
got so many vertices edges and all the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
got so many vertices edges and all the
polygons<00:01:17.430> components<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> our<00:01:18.509> scene

polygons components we have in our scene
that<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.560> very<00:01:19.650> handy<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.400> we've<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.670> any

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that can be very handy if we've got any

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
that can be very handy if we've got any
polygon<00:01:21.180> limits<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.770> limit

in this particular project I'm going to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
in this particular project I'm going to
have<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.290> limit<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.009> 15,000<00:01:29.880> polygons

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

it'll<00:06:36.910> push<00:06:37.060> it<00:06:37.210> back<00:06:37.330> as<00:06:37.480> well

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
it'll push it back as well

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.910 
it'll push it back as well
I'm<00:06:38.560> going<00:06:38.770> to<00:06:39.780> now<00:06:40.780> put<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.200> Alpha<00:06:41.560> game<00:06:41.740> back

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
I'm going to now put the Alpha game back

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.600 
I'm going to now put the Alpha game back
to<00:06:42.130> one<00:06:42.340> hundred<00:06:42.490> percent<00:06:46.200> on<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.710> side<00:06:48.430> view

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
to one hundred percent on the side view

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.410 
to one hundred percent on the side view
so<00:06:48.910> let's<00:06:49.060> do<00:06:49.180> that<00:06:51.300> maximizing<00:06:52.300> our

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
so let's do that maximizing our

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.810 
so let's do that maximizing our
perspective<00:06:52.960> viewport<00:06:53.520> another<00:06:54.520> issue<00:06:54.700> that

perspective viewport another issue that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.430 
perspective viewport another issue that
we<00:06:55.030> can<00:06:55.180> address<00:06:55.390> is<00:06:55.630> that<00:06:55.750> drew<00:06:55.960> in<00:06:56.050> modeling

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
we can address is that drew in modeling

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.530 
we can address is that drew in modeling
we<00:06:56.920> may<00:06:57.190> accidentally<00:06:57.760> select<00:06:58.180> our<00:06:58.360> image

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
we may accidentally select our image

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.630 
we may accidentally select our image
planes<00:06:58.780> when<00:06:59.320> we<00:06:59.440> want<00:06:59.680> to<00:06:59.800> select<00:07:00.010> a<00:07:00.250> polygon

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.970 
planes when we want to select a polygon
component<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.360> to<00:07:01.960> fix<00:07:02.170> this<00:07:02.350> we<00:07:02.530> can<00:07:02.680> create

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
component and to fix this we can create

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.860 
component and to fix this we can create
a<00:07:03.010> layer<00:07:03.280> and<00:07:03.520> reference<00:07:03.850> it<00:07:04.000> out<00:07:04.150> so<00:07:04.750> that's

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
a layer and reference it out so that's

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.710 
a layer and reference it out so that's
our<00:07:05.110> image<00:07:05.350> planes<00:07:05.710> are<00:07:06.100> unselectable<00:07:06.910> but

our image planes are unselectable but

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.390 
our image planes are unselectable but
just<00:07:07.960> fill<00:07:08.080> it<00:07:08.140> with<00:07:08.260> tip<00:07:08.470> if<00:07:08.650> you<00:07:08.800> select<00:07:09.280> your

plane set up I don't have enough time to

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.960 
plane set up I don't have enough time to
show<00:08:02.740> you<00:08:02.830> guys<00:08:02.980> the<00:08:03.160> workflow<00:08:03.520> i'll<00:08:03.730> be<00:08:03.820> using

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:03.970 
show you guys the workflow i'll be using

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.520 
show you guys the workflow i'll be using
in<00:08:04.120> this<00:08:04.210> video<00:08:04.510> so<00:08:04.720> that's<00:08:04.960> exactly<00:08:05.320> what<00:08:05.470> we

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:05.530 
in this video so that's exactly what we

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.440 
in this video so that's exactly what we
do<00:08:05.650> in<00:08:05.830> the<00:08:05.860> next<00:08:06.010> video<00:08:06.310> and<00:08:06.520> then<00:08:07.150> after<00:08:07.420> that

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:07.450 
do in the next video and then after that

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.030 
do in the next video and then after that
we'll<00:08:07.690> start<00:08:07.960> modeling<00:08:08.290> out<00:08:08.440> to<00:08:08.590> the<00:08:08.680> jetpack

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.040 
we'll start modeling out to the jetpack

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.110 
we'll start modeling out to the jetpack
so<00:08:09.610> i'll<00:08:09.820> see<00:08:10.060> you<00:08:10.120> in<00:08:10.210> this<00:08:10.300> video<00:08:10.600> thanks
