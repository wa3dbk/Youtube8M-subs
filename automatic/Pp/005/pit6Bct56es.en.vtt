 I want it saying in a video reaction 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 telephone cinema on facebook I have 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.570
 of function to a cfm animation that clear 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.279
 the link of this video leaves it in the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 description and the original channel of who 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 he has created it then because this is a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.269
 video that is called visiting the pizzeria 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 that baloy pizzeria phishing and 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.160
 Then they said that I would like 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.480
 that he's going to like and it's very funny, so 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 Well, no missions out of nothing 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 then you all know to put the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.020
 little corner always on my face so that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.940
 reacts the video and the video of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 telephone cinema so they have all their 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 I support him because you are the creator 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.760
 original of this video that I'm 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.120
 making a video reaction and that is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.860
 as they say it is fair to give the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 credits to the creator then let's go for 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 we are going to give him play and to see you are fm 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.790
 animation of fine actors and 321 already 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.090
 lets go see it 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.090
 ya ya'm worth them 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 to look there are the two normal 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.950
 animatronics of 1 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 j 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.660
 although with him 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.130
 how it gets nervous foxx and there 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.130
 I understand that there is romance and romance 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.020
 they are talking all bone 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 is talking to us all and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.390
 next english are like that arriving 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.560
 nothing more or less but they are not talking 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.600
 nothing 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.070
 if nothing more nice logical that was what 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.940
 I am 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.750
 that is, the video lasted very little 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.750
 bored poor 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 matters 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.830
 do not 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 ah 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.450
 and many more 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.300
 unworthy mike 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.230
 it's like the video they sat 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.230
 and I was left with my mouth open as I 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.290
 I really expected it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.390
 So that 's where it's nice when 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 you see animatronics as well as manguel 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.920
 in fox and we already knew there was romance 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.980
 between them two but it 's very good 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.989
 animation wanted the truth is great 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.849
 but good this so that you see it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.560
 more at ease was in the description of 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.370
