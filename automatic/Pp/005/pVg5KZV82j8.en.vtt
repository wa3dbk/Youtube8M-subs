00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.609
 today in a new video for 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.470
 show you the fabulous jimmy pis of the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.030
 mark enchanted polish I have you 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 just do a little video for you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.170
 show its reflections at the graphic day this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.440
 last one of the most beautiful I have 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 and I do not know how to put it in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.570
 alert because frankly it gets 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.730
 is enough for himself 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 So here I tried a little trick 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.300
 income to my usual size stripping 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.300
 I hope you like the video 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 I anticipate the questions that are going to me 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 ask as usual under the video 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.930
 the small strips of Scotch is called 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 intake of strips I write you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.559
 name just below in the description 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 these are small strips of tape that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 allow it to either let flow 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 under the nails the care of using them 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.040
 as I will do in this video 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 you can find it everywhere 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 on the internet very little in store 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 physical 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.020
 to my knowledge there is on the one hand 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.930
 you can find some on amazon by 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 the frozen water already explained there are some 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.109
 tribunes they are not expensive at all 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.609
 which are going to be of rather poor quality 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.590
 for example if you want to leave 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.359
 stick on your nails by putting your 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 rating the streaming color such as 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.409
 may rub off on your fingernail and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 it's a little annoying when you come from 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 lay down her polish and make a pretty 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 thing 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.869
 So here it comes after me the bes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.280
 or old ones I never use them 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.049
 with the top coat of what I know who 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 fade each time otherwise you 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.689
 can find others I you 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 would put some links if I find 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.930
 brand that I know who are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.930
 good enough 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.840
 so as you can see we do not have trouble 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.860
 badly to own this court I think that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 all the girls who are watching this 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.830
 video and who have already tried know of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.900
 what am I talking about 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.640
 there is really something to get excited about but 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.960
 do not need patience 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.490
 I use a tweezers 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.620
 I think it's a lot more 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.390
 practical and I glue actually I cut 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.650
 before starting my elsewhere all 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.550
 small pieces because once 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.500
 you have your fingers in the nail polish 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.420
 to take scissors is not at all 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.030
 easy so I stick that on the ledge of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.040
 my office jean cutout beautiful shadow two 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
 the number of requests I need 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.400
 there I had twenty cups 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 I believe to make some wonder 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.500
 something like that and it's a lot more 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.500
 convenient to use 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.190
 this is almost the end of the video 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 I take this opportunity to give you the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.640
 information about tomorrow's live 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.230
 since I postponed the one of the week 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.090
 last I was sick and I got 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.190
 excuse again I do not really know what 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.420
 we could do tomorrow so say 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.170

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.990

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.700
 the live will be at 16 hours and not 16 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.440
 30 hours but 16 hours games
