00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there I see I see so that means now it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
there I see I see so that means now it's
settled<00:01:52.710> bail<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> marched<00:01:53.640> 13<00:01:54.119> and

of Pacquiao Mayweather yeah for some

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
of Pacquiao Mayweather yeah for some
reason<00:02:00.600> Mayweather<00:02:01.290> thought<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> was

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
reason Mayweather thought it was

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.649
