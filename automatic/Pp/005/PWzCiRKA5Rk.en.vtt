00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.160
 when we open the program we have a splash 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.900
 screen 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.290
 what is this screen doing 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.920
 introductory are fixed here I can 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 disappear 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.450
 here we find it again 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.770
 and good 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.770
 this is nothing more than 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 the information of the program that we are 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.540
 using 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.290
 blender 2.75 to the version 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.140
 we are using that is the latest version 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.990
 official let's say 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.120
 here comes the date 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.120
 and the time 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.570
 was released is in this version of 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.570
 blender 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.610
 and good 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.970
 we have some adjustment here to change 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.330
 our keys all our our 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.030
 keyboard shortcuts and so on 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.840
 the keys that we use if we have 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 used another third dimension problem 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.180
 in some other programs and you've 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.210
 used maya to design to model 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.070
 You can bring your shortcuts 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 key configurations that are used 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:36.369
 there to use them to sell 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.600
 but in this case we will arrive at the default 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.800
 default that is to sell 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 we will learn to use 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 his shortcuts his keys and his 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.090
 configurations that is the idea too 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.450
 from this pulse, we really have links from 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.930
 here on the left side of the splash 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.930
 screen 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.610
 or count the start 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.820
 these links 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 allow us to go make a donation to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.540
 to the organization that is to sell that is 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.340
 an organization of different 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.850
 developers around the world too 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 we have a manual 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.170
 we have a link to 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 the website the website page of 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.840
 blender we can go directly to 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.970
 Retrieve the last session or the last 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.230
 auto 6 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.700
 so much saved that it was generated we were 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.220
 working we talked about the program 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.610
 etcetera there is always a car recorded on 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.470
 latest 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.660
 and the recent files if you are a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 worker leander is a version that 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.080
 they just installed 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.959
 and erased its cache review its 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.180
 windows machine sorry your system 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.060
 operative they reinstalled it they recovered 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 etcetera here will not have anything are 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.870
 recent files if they already worked something 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.349
 to appear to them his last 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.349
 jobs 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.090
 and good is everything on the splash screen 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.860
 screen both start to close this 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 screen is very easy we click on 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.550
 any other side can be a button or 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.990
 Even that click will not detect you 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 but that 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.640
 that action just roll over to splash and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.640
 screen and it will leave us in the program 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 this is a start screen 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.130
 usual in the program - that 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.580
 configure something else we always 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.220
 a cube will appear the same 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.990
 what we see here is a camera now 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.990
 then explain lighting 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.810
 and well, here we start 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.930
 with what has been the interface of 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.299
 true program 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 the beginning we go many buttons but 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.710
 do not 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.580
 you have to be alarmed this is easier 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.440
 what it looks like 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.740
 and if you have worked a problem of 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.740
 design 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.130
 Authorized drawing image editing and 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.650
 Oiled videos is related to 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.739
 all this because many things that will be 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.570
 family and if not now we will see each other and 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.990
 it will be easier to meet with him 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.990
 Program
