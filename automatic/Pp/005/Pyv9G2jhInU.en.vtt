seems<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.220> think<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.490> should<00:01:51.670> be<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.820> penalty

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
seems to think it should be a penalty

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.420 
seems to think it should be a penalty
but<00:01:52.720> an<00:01:52.869> indirect<00:01:53.290> free<00:01:53.439> kick<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.979> verdict

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
but an indirect free kick is the verdict

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.160 
but an indirect free kick is the verdict
