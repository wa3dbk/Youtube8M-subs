00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello with you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.460
 powder stroke deal 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.260
 And a review of the tablets and mida and not 7 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.240
 seven-inch screen and android ankvab one 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.039
 on board 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.039
 charger included 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.079
 headphones 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.669
 changed the cable for connecting external 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.369
 devices such as a flash drive 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.460
 or modem 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.710
 such cables with her beat to connect 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.980
 with a computer 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 as well as an adapter to an American newspaper 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.630
 here is the device itself 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
 so she looks 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.230
 and here's to compare the phone aspire 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 ikram prisons 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.360
 of course there is a difference 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.100
 on the back of the device 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 it is located dynamics is quite loud 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 cover itself 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.320
 a bit slippery but fingerprints they 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.470
 the device is not visible 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.800
 in the side we have two 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.410
 buttons 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.980
 however but the point 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.900
 give action back 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.550
 the second button call me in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.850
 applications 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 on the back side 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.540
 device located 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 such here well nests 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.590
 the first jack is for the charger 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.620
 devices 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.240
 headphone 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.370
 micro beat her 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.060
 Here is such a small button for 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 on off 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.799
 device 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.990
 single to connect to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 tv 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.500
 micro card slot is everywhere 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.070
 third party 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 there is a button to turn on 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.370
 display off 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.950
 these devices are not used it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 is a skiff committee through 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.490
 some preset time 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.400
 the device itself 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 is in the plans for processors 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.290
 in theory 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.479
 in which 720 megahertz works here 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.169
 and idle 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 36 melendez respectively 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.540
 also there are two gigabytes hear 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.370
 card 206 megabytes of ddr2 RAM 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.389
 but 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.259
 and the device can be twisted to twist 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.419
 everything turns upside down 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.529
 com i him 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.899
 maybe an hour the same as in the iphone 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.619
 we launch the browser 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.599
 suck loads 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.649
 google a 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.649
 we lead by layer 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.929
 board run 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.929
 point of business 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.839
 peripetias 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.839
 Patrick Van Der 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.989
 he warned the site 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.930
 on the nickle can flip for 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.540
 some demonstrations here 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.269
 he is so shallow we can twice 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.099
 shout out increases 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.989
 Alla 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.829
 click again decreases twice 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.659
 also supported multitouch we can im 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.749
 two fingers 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.749
 push reduce reduce what to run 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.609
 but 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.919
 fsfr file finished 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.019
 Now I would like to show you how they work. 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.079
 e 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.259
 movies on this device 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:40.719
 we leave 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.719
 come such 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.409
 run 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.409
 conductor 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:53.429
 In this case, the processor 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:55.329
 supports hardware 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.769
 lost and wait for the video 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.870
 on our screen resolution of 800 by 600 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.699
 pixels 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.139
 Now we will see the resolution video. 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.370
 1080 pixels i.e. childrenâ€™s fouls 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.709
 this here is harry potter movie 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.019
 more accurate trailer 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.729
 there are all sorts of effects 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.029
 that is, you can see it all 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.400
 volume of the seventeenth year 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 high 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.090
 but 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.430
 but 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.550
 but 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.550
 but 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.150
 here as we see the leader does not slow down 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.680
 the sound is good too 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.680
 everything works great 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.089
 so at least demonstrate 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:01.279
 job jay serb 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.579
 This is such a thing that arbitrarily 

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:04.909
 devices 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:05.820
 which 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.159
 allows 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:08.459
 interaction with programs 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.339
 show 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.339
 that is, his position in space 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 and also with the benefit of turning the screen 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 that is, we have such a wonderful ugta 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.580
 pear he called go in 3d maze approx 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.219
 even run 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.969
 and demonstrate how to 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.969
 works 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.229
 choose 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.539
 we wish school 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.359
 here we have such a ball we can 

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.370
 ride 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.370
 based on the tilt of the devices 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:20.939
 with such a wonderful all the work 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.099
 thank you for watching ours 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.139
 review it was a steam paring shop 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.369
 with an actor 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.520
