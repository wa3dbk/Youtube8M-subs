00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 Cato like the real life 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.769
 player movements within the game of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.179
 soccer on the video game for example as the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.580
 technique that is also used in films 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.470
 how king kong lord of the flame rings 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 mockup motion capture looks only wins 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.640
 friends of the globe network hence the whole staff 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.580
 the finishing touches leaving everything ready 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 lots of technology the computer 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.750
 soon all the thrills of the movie 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.510
 value there are details friend this is the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 main studio of the Canadian eei 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 spot gold entered the place where 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 machines could be human process 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.360
 called motion capture capture 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.360
 movements 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 everybody here plays or understands games 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 and no, I'm not very connected, it's the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.780
 colleagues play a lot I see but saw 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.240
 I'm not very close, personally. 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.759
 Do not need hair, you're the man. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 the Brazilian attacker of the iccat bank already 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.479
 was a model for one day 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.880
 for that he wore this outfit 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.570
 weirdo full of balls is what 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 will map the movements of his body 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 ferguson even though these rings around 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 of the camera lens sent a light 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.840
 red that destroys what is light 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
 hit the ball is reflected back to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.580
 bed then this red light can 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 determine the position of each of the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.560
 polka dots in the classics 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.110
 closing the species from head to toe 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 everything covered by the balls the problem is 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.789
 hit the ball so hard peace too 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.039
 It's tricky to lose a little 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.840
 move but so good, let's go 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.020
 before playing from a photo shoot 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 to register the position of the sensors 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 if he leaves the place the technicians have 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.729
 a reference of where they were 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.299
 any error even if it is millimeter 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.610
 can ruin all the work here is the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.880
 center of the studio and a graminha 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.840
 a beam synthetic there a networked 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.799
 back a large structure and has 1 118 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.720
 cameras 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.329
 they will capture the movements of 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.450
 players and all this goes to the 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.450
 computer 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.420
 haiti is not a heating are 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.550
 first movements so that the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.709
 computer recognize the body of 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.620
 players as soon as the machine detects 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.480
 all dots starts the best part 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.660
 him hitting ball 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.190
 they skip multiple bids of a match 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.340
 the rebec is pet looks television 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.740
 all in real time is transformed 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.020
 in graphics in virtual field 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.210
 first these dolls strangers 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.940
 followed by a version that looks more like a 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.100
 real player is just the tip of the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.110
 process will still go through a 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.910
 nice deal for the animators 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.130
 the more perfect the capture of 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:17.550
 more real-world images 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:20.370
 go stay the little game is expensive and there's a 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.600
 beats virtual ball created from 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.380
 two players 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.600
 is the real-life imitating video game 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.709
 This is what I work for over three hours. 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.550
 like this 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.550
 clubbing 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.489
 In Brazil we have 190 million 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.129
 coaches at mou's studio either had 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.400
 a lot with pt and when people 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.650
 talked and asked things for the boatmen and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.849
 tied that one not satisfied he 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.849
 showed that he wanted 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.700
 each technician is concerned about a 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.270
 certain movement or the creation of 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.270
 a new move 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.209
 think 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.729
 itha great dável soccer club is 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.389
 detail all this you've seen so far 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.520
 is for fifa 13 because 12 is already 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.160
 ready and believe me 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.190
 will remind us of an old 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:39.389
 known from the Sundays 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.850
 the last that the defender left Sunday only 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.850
 sucking because I'm peaks of the world 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.900
 who explains the novelty is the Colombian 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.970
 santiago jaramillo in são marino a guy 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.720
 he is primarily responsible for 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.150
 modifications that favor a 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.039
 transmontano is not so for fifa 12 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.620
 is the biggest change is a new system of 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.500
 collisions and more real physical interactions 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.270
 and much more authentic and bowels 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.460
 Physical much more real in the past 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.949
 authentic the computer will take into 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.300
 the muscle mass of the two 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.610
 players in the bid 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.160
 just imagine the neymar with that physical 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:26.080
 It 's a light weight butterfly steak 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.190
 bumping into the zagge and need to say 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.190
 Who's going to lead the worst? 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.410
 now felt right has more change in 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.449
 forget that business of keeping 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.979
 the x button is pressed so your 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.940
 player steals the ball 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:46.930
 now you need to have skill tactic 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.669
 At the time of scoring the drogba player 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.979
 Japanese and ball control with more 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.870
 accuracy closer to the actual movement 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.330
 when and have more possibility in 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.979
 play to further protect the ball and that 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.570
 formerly to protect the ball only 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.940
 push a button and the player did everything 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.419
 alone now it will be necessary position 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.419
 manually 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.740
 tokyo 6 88 m boi but no use 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.840
 if the dolls do not have the face of the 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.700
 players and this should also 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840
 change the stars of the whole world 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:22.520
 passed by the studio as this vote in 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.440
 360 degrees and then a little bit of 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.670
 photoshop to give a tidy 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.920
 can ready face of a muzzle of the other 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.440
 all this virtual soccer is every 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.760
 more like the reality but 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.080
 without forgetting that everything is a great 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:44.420
 Just kidding 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:47.890
 joão smiles there in the colón or the same 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.890
 feeling young again
