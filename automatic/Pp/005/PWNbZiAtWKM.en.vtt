00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 hey people what kind of help works and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.689
 Welcome to a today times 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.830
 some other video and indeed to this day 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
 for you a few very interesting 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 facts about the new call of duty this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.410
 Facts are not one hundred percent 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.450
 sure because they are not official 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.829
 have been confirmed but I have very good 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.840
 reasons to believe that these facts 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.220
 I really should find out 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 that these facts are not true then 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 I will get this video out right away 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.670
 to take 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 that is if you see this video 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 I have not taken out yet and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 So these facts are not yet 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
 refuted and are therefore 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.379
 most likely these too 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 I have facts from an American 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.640
 commentator of the below in the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 description is the one has this one 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.090
 Activision employee this time 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.800
 through it can let so first 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.840
 for the name the name will not call of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.090
 duty modern warfare be four but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.710
 call of duty ghosts that means that here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 with such a whole new call of duty series 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 emerges and the modern warfare series 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.140
 thus stops or at least in this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.790
 Part not continued is the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.040
 Presentation of this call of Dutys will 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 probably around the first five of 2013 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 its tenth around it does not have exactly the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 first fifth sander is for anyone 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 period is planned around the story 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.789
 be back so futuristic and a 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.079
 You will also get black ops in front of everyone 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.759
 things in singleplayer see where it is 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.710
 again a futuristic story 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.149
 the multiplayer will probably work 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.679
 are less futuristic as well as in the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.999
 black ops where you actually do that 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.189
 but can not see it in this part 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.899
 it will be special again 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.639
 older weapons are used here 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.109
 I do not mean weapons from that 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.090
 first or second world war but 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.829
 modern weapons as from the present time 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.959
 but no futuristic weapons now 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.219
 any laser gun or something like that 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.420
 is quite strange but will 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.549
 probably with the story somehow 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.079
 in the singleplayer is related to 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.149
 example that some tail the whole 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.499
 alien weapons or has destroyed that can 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.270
 I do not tell you that I own it myself 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.100
 definitely not know the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.329
 weapons normal weapons are this today 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.969
 probably also in reality 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.779
 as well as a modern warfare and yes there is looking forward 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.969
 I'm really into it 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:04.649
 Another very special point is 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.659
 that entry into the match changed 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729
 will be in the previous call of dutys 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.920
 a girl always started in the 3 2 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.690
 1 and countdown letter was counted 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 but in this call of duty will be the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.300
 be dynamic 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.459
 that's a little hard that is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.599
 namely, the beginning of the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.670
 example be that one from one 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.349
 helicopter jumps or that one in 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 This app is easy to get out of 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.099
 a truck jumps that is yes 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.079
 in other cod styling already in 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.100
 singleplayer but here it is synonymous in 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.770
 be multiplayer 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 should therefore be a real battle to quasi 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.100
 adjust and then more realistic 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.000
 do 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.770
 besides, it's probably something 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.150
 more interesting if you come as a 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.430
 if you just have the countdown 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 counting down will also be there 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.250
 no dive jump give that more 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.560
 interested but probably not 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.180
 I 'll even mention it and it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.190
 There is something new and you can do it 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.990
 Thus griechen around on the floor 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.400
 I crawl and shoot 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.620
 not how they imagine 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.150
 that should look like but according to these 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.130
 is information which is also the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.750
 be like in black ops elections in 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.270
 other call of duty part would be too 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.560
 to be possible again too late though I am 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.010
 Not many people now see it 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.810
 do 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.340
 while you get you can also to 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.990
 this is like in daisy 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.270
 if you know what you're playing, you know that 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.950
 So it is then on the quasi 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.850
 ground and does his part 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.770
 right and left 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.270
 I think they are pretty cool and 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.550
 I'm curious how it is then 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.110
 is also realized as a mini 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.790
 game no more spec ops like in 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.950
 moordorf so this he right 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.360
 completely finished it will be very 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.460
 probably not a zombie mode 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.960
 because that is a fact and that 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.820
 has nothing to do with infinity wards 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.080
 so they will do something again 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.060
 think new and there I am 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.500
 very excited also was on 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.780
 It is very important to the developers that they are 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.460
 bring in an interactive environment 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.810
 word may sound a bit strange to some 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.520
 know that maybe but I explain 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.810
 that means interactive environment 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520
 for example, that the environment 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.280
 is dangerous as for example in hydro 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.290
 the water or inn express this train 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.460
 So that you are killed by the environment 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.590
 and then there to watch out too 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.330
 must also have at something 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.160
 battlefield 3 oriented and indeed can 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.720
 you destroy the environment now something 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.970
 you probably will not be like that now 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.950
 destroy a complete house though 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.300
 one throws 14 against the wall then becomes 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.340
 that already left traces and not 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.330
 as in other call of duty pay 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.340
 that the map is actually complete 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.570
 only one remains unchanged 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.190
 Information not from my 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.260
 But Feuerbing Source is still 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.580
 not very unlikely and indeed 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.870
 It could be that the new call of 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.150
 Duty only on the next generation 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.700
 So playing platform is for 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.930
 for example the ps4 or the xbox 720 or 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.120
 whatever the name is and 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.770
 of course pc so that call of duty on 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.510
 to play the next generation platform 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.510
 Of course, it is very likely 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.770
 but that's not on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.370
 It's got me to play more 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.290
 surprised 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.820
 It also surprised me because so yes 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.830
 many players will lose too 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.270
 I do not know how the graphics will be 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.730
 if the power is really good 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.690
 that the ps3 or xbox 360 is not 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.860
 I can do more 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.630
 actually can not imagine 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.250
 then I would understand it but otherwise 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.180
 i cant understand maybe 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.680
 they will still be 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.450
 bring it on the ps3 or 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.400
 xbox 360 can play 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.900
 but right now it does not look like that 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.460
 so I hope the just mentioned 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.530
 Information is all correct where I am 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.090
 but go out if you like it 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.620
 we have a thumbs up with it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.090
 many others can see it and 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.340
 then your friends are missing 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.600
 These are also interested in something and 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.600
 Yes, I'll tell you, it's pure people again
