00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 that you've been asking for since very, very 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 a long time I know it and so it's gone 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.620
 we will start with the first question 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.059
 will you make other series that stubborn 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 torreon and adventure maps so yes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.859
 I planned to make gta 5 on pc I 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 planned to make short films on 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.869
 minecraft help and continue my 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.359
 architectural series so go 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 start again I restart and all that I 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 may be doing one of the series and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.910
 terraforming stuff like that for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.809
 understand a little bit how that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.320
 walk the terraforming but here you go 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 show your head in one of your videos 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.110
 for now I have not planned on the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 do and I started to inquire 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 a little bit about the cameras and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 it's quite expensive anyway for a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.350
 camera for example a camera 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.789
 Canon reflex of quite good quality 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.680
 it's very very expensive would be very expensive 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 so for now no I have not planned 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.730
 at all to show my head in one of 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.000
 so in his faq 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.960

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.359
