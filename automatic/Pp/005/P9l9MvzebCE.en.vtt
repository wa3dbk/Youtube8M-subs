00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.040
 5 What 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:17.020
 Do you know a new promotion offering Sinnae-dong hageteupnida 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:21.880
 In this time, I'll start writing to you about the two-handed fan 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:28.210
 Oh, I'm now a lot of those lessons hanteneun hands now fade in recent daesun 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.970
 I've Mercure players, but also a lot of positive bands are now used 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.470
 In recent years , 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.260
 Many people who speak them correctly in both hands and I handed painter Caucasian 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.519
 Becoming a must in a way that I think still heard speaking 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.570
 I am personally teaching at college, 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.549
 You can enter 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:53.290
 Because both hands are better than one hand - the ligaments are good for learning skills. 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:56.470
 It is also good to have another spin after the burr. 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.820
 There, because about a thousand prints glasses, so that both sides - the lecture about 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.659
 I do a lot 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.670
 So I am face amount of disease transmission in this time now in many of the body 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:08.290
 After years of hardship 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:12.759
 In an opus dance, we can change a stance, 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.740
 Shall you be in the open was thinking what a way to take advantage asking 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:21.820
 It would be advantageous to take a stance 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:25.440
 Because what is inde hands with the fans is the fact that we left so chideut included 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.640
 You can think of it as a point . 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.450
 In fact, in the case of a two-handed backhand , this rotation radius 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.410
 Catch 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.480
 So if you walk this way and do not really care about the waist dancing or stance lime waist 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.460
 Really be 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.000
 It can not be at any cost by that body rotates so I Upon 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.010
 How you can do today in concert dancing at Spencer 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.580
 And the players 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.900
 I am now today the case that the player being a soul 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.640
 Uh kdb its 2013 Korea Open 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.840
 It 's because I'm hitting both hands on Rod Vanska who won the women's singles. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 Briefly 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:09.060
 So this is the way I am playing this game . 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.650
 The player does not have a lot of work, 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.300
 But I see that Orson Spencer's sister, 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.080
 This introduced me to tell you switch enthusiasts and is open at the end will help 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.080
 Deseo should try to start if one did this white rock dwaeseo 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.780
 From Perth to Perth dance 5 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.690
 The distance between two feet 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.630
 In the orange stance, of this seed. 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.400
 This is an open attempt. 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.190
 Square ssenseu so I could walk normally again as soon as you count 1 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.240
 I'm going to get a square stance this way. 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:52.310
 Oh, now that suddenly, for example if you have not difficult away comeback 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.050
 Next time you return from a very high point open stance in one case 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.270
 I use it a lot. 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:05.459
 When the people of Saint-open stance also subtract the taste it is gonna do Buddhist 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.680
 You know, I do not just do it. 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.040
 The phone is now in good shape. 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.019
 Years we open stance at the fords back pin forehand 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.050
 This is what's so hasyeotdeutyi ahreuke Sam had used the angular momentum 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.830
 When we get positive biases, 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:27.450
 People who are not players are hard to turn around 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:32.670
 It waenya exercise physical condition went through the state because they do not experience much 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:37.049
 Once the opus dances are done, the advantage of itself is to shake off the body 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.500
 So it 's nice to get rid of your body . 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.560
 8 Positive white people use body rotation 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.690
 Much more powerful 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.829
 You can have enough spins all over your body to fight through 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.069
 Because the loaf of me, so you party when exiting Turkey Boys 2 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.389
 This is the case. 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.609
 You can do it according to the thread. If your body does this, 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.159
 When it is not hard 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:08.930
 Look'm having a representative where 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.799
 If the mushroom is eating and eating again, the first pitch is also the way and you eat grass 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 that 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:18.910
 Now, even if from afar'll still like me 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:24.850
 So naturally we have failed more Tidori including the Center 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:28.960
 So when you put away a lot of the sensors are allowed to accompany you to the good use of the body 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.940
 It's a good way to put both hands on white people . 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.240
 Off sensor 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.990
 I've got a lesson for you guys in the band . 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.990
 So your hot 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.310
 Well, for the fosters, open stance can be used to the body 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.919
 New to the Republic 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:55.840
 It's free so you have to go through that slow action, 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.280
 It would have been a swing name 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.120
 When you do 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.909
 Looking to have a try through off stance is now a good body naeeotdeon 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.749
 I can get enough of the missing parts. 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:13.879
 So you today who is a short train struck the band in any kind of cut 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:14.900
 Come maybe seven times, once gently far more positive than the previous expression 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:19.460
 In translation 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:23.449
 So, in the present situation, I have to do it naturally. 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:28.279
 Learn to any concept of the open stance doesimyeon see No. 50 Chip 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:32.599
 Is that you can use your body much more than before . 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:36.349
 So to learn you a new skill 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:39.740
 It's fun and it takes an hour . 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:43.879
 It's hard, but it's still fun to learn 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.610
 So, do you sense that there's more based one another every morning now so ex 

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:51.620
 Shrinking and why I missed you now. 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:53.000
 This film is indifferent to what we have a passion for hard dance 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.629
 They are cold 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.629
 I can tell you that imagination is as fun as I said through c 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:01.629
 I wish you a happy and healthy life. Thank you.
