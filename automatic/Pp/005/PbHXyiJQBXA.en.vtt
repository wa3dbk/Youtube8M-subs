00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.540
 ati venit org.it of silvia developed by electric radiants is based on one 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.059
 series of videos of nothing allow us to use in an alternative way 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.370
 some features of the monster 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.230
 obviously activity is not limited to this but will also allow you to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.170
 assign certain actions 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.760
 as the opening of an application that uses a particular attention in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.740
 twitter hola simple 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.870
 management of hypertension native of the device at jesus many I have 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 pressing of physical device keys 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 which of course 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 will take place different than what I love about you photo 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.570
 as you can see, score does not install some

 new icon 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.710
 on the springboard 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 mazzini trailer directly with a setting 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.990
 obviously being a cydia tweak to be need of the jailbreak for 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.930
 to be printed 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 we then have the settings 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 let's explore to the partinic voice 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.380
 this year etna shadow of the program from which we have access to all 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 main functions 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.460
 we will be able to choose whether to activate a specific function of the screen 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 block 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730
 in applications like the screen 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.750
 I always clicked on 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 in all these types of activation 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 among other things it is called the presence of new thousand 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 the function introduced with the last activity update that we will see 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.190
 better always 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 now for example 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.640
 let's try then to resign ourselves to the double pressure in the status bar 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.739
 display registration in the font with display recorder 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.209
 so since we have no particular preferences 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 we always click on 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.309
 then on status bar blocks connection 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.209
 and currently we see and there is no action assigned to it 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.959
 determined 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.389
 multi management 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.799
 therefore I call you on the display recorder 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.939
 and here is a function assigned to the double pressure of the 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.849
 status bar 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.169
 let's go out 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.409
 and take twice on the clock 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.969
 travel on the clock 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.559
 at the top of the statusbar 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.299
 ept we equip that summer instantly activated display recorder 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.759
 if instead 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.759
 first to report a new works this management 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.589
 for example 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.689
 the ability to close all com applications 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.009
 multiplicand 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.399
 just select it as you will see it will be replaced 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.819
 to display recorder 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.539
 and following the same action 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.539
 all applications will be closed 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 to multiply 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.549
 in fact there are no more 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.949
 obviously there are so many alternative functions 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:47.339
 and therefore can be exploited by the user as - prefer 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.209
 for example the behavior in the home button can be changed 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.790
 that of the fear button of the joint buttons 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.089
 the volume buttons 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:11.180
 and some simple gestures inside the springboard or the zoom of the 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.819
 popcorn icons 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 the compression then the gesture 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.779
 let us now turn to the creation of god. 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.930
 we had already anticipated that we would have focused on this function 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 as a novelty of the last update 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.789
 we have already created an empire 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.419
 the show me the whole procedure 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.270
 she believes in another 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.979
 then click on add new menu 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.979
 and we will be asked to enter a title for this - 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 we type alcon italia 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.669
 and we click suffrage 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.199
 as you can see the morning the man came and was immediately inserted 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.159
 inside bellavista you win 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.240
 click on 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.099
 and from this section we should add 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.999
 the equations that 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.120
 we want 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.499

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:13.860
 just created 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.770
 select models and display recorder 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.729
 for the council 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.729

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.779
 lock at the bottom write 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.779
 let's add many tweets tweet fonts 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.429
 and if we also want some system actions 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:39.199
 that all the spots are still present. 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.340
 those related to the phone showing in the end section 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.749
 sb settings buttons 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.409

 take a screenshot 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.379
 Dagospia 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.499
 hockey this our menu these are the functions we have chosen 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.300
 and now I should link the menu to a particular action 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.779
 for example 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.279
 then the pinch to zoom 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.999
 so let's scroll again 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:20.949

 we will try to apply on screen capture 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.309
 perlasca was a screenshot of the
