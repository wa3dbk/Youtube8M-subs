00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
this better should have done that at the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.550 
this better should have done that at the
beginning<00:02:47.040> why<00:02:47.610> did<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.970> not<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.660> always<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.380> this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
beginning why did I not I always do this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
beginning why did I not I always do this
I'm<00:02:50.460> going<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> start<00:02:50.730> by<00:02:51.000> drawing<00:02:51.060> kind<00:02:51.990> of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I'm going to start by drawing kind of

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.170 
I'm going to start by drawing kind of
like<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.380> line<00:02:53.840> at<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.260> bottom<00:02:55.730> at<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.910> start

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
like a line at the bottom at the start

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
like a line at the bottom at the start
of<00:02:57.240> my<00:02:57.390> eyebrow<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.260> make<00:02:58.410> sense<00:02:58.440> so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
of my eyebrow does that make sense so

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.800 
of my eyebrow does that make sense so
yeah<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.550> drawing<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.970> line<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.300> connect<00:03:00.630> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
yeah just drawing a line to connect it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.050 
yeah just drawing a line to connect it
and<00:03:01.020> then<00:03:01.140> I'm<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.410> going<00:03:01.680> further<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.489> just

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
and then I'm just going further in just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.729 
and then I'm just going further in just
going<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:03.750> lightly<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.290> drawing<00:03:04.650> these

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
going in very lightly and drawing these

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.530 
going in very lightly and drawing these
little<00:03:05.040> strands<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.410> then<00:03:08.239> I'm<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.420> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
little strands and then I'm going to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
little strands and then I'm going to
start<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.930> downwards<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:14.040> just

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
start going downwards here and then just

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.979 
start going downwards here and then just
working<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.000> through<00:03:15.030> there<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.570> going<00:03:15.780> in

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
working it through there and going in

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.240 
working it through there and going in
with<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.470> light<00:03:16.680> hand<00:03:16.709> because<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
with a really light hand because you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.650 
with a really light hand because you
don't<00:03:17.400> want<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> go<00:03:17.670> too<00:03:17.730> dark<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.270> this<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
don't want to go too dark with this and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.090 
don't want to go too dark with this and
that's<00:03:19.020> another<00:03:19.230> thing<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.709> really<00:03:19.770> like

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that's another thing that I really like

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.949 
that's another thing that I really like
about<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.520> normally<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.209> would<00:03:21.750> buy<00:03:21.930> a

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
about this is normally I would buy a

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.220 
about this is normally I would buy a
darker<00:03:22.620> pencil<00:03:22.800> but<00:03:23.690> sometimes<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.050> go<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
darker pencil but sometimes I can go a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.260 
darker pencil but sometimes I can go a
little<00:03:25.410> too<00:03:25.680> heavy-handed<00:03:26.070> with<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> darker

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
little too heavy-handed with a darker

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.940 
little too heavy-handed with a darker
one<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.230> end<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.470> turning<00:03:28.680> out

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
one so then they end up turning out

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160 
one so then they end up turning out
darker<00:03:29.670> than<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.000> want<00:03:30.300> them<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.510> if<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.989> have

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
anything I forgot to mention before I

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.600 
anything I forgot to mention before I
even<00:05:24.020> started<00:05:24.440> filling<00:05:24.770> them<00:05:24.889> in<00:05:25.009> that<00:05:25.580> I

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
even started filling them in that I

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.480 
even started filling them in that I
already<00:05:26.330> plucked<00:05:26.840> my<00:05:27.020> eyebrows<00:05:27.440> yesterday<00:05:28.099> so

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
already plucked my eyebrows yesterday so

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.399 
already plucked my eyebrows yesterday so
I<00:05:28.520> didn't<00:05:28.969> need<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.419> that<00:05:29.570> again<00:05:29.630> but

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
I didn't need to do that again but

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.439 
I didn't need to do that again but
whenever<00:05:30.620> I<00:05:30.770> do<00:05:30.860> pluck<00:05:31.280> my<00:05:31.430> eyebrows<00:05:31.849> I<00:05:32.150> just

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
whenever I do pluck my eyebrows I just

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.959 
whenever I do pluck my eyebrows I just
go<00:05:32.630> underneath<00:05:33.229> them<00:05:33.620> just<00:05:33.949> like<00:05:34.070> along<00:05:34.460> here

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
go underneath them just like along here

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.240 
go underneath them just like along here
that's<00:05:35.270> basically<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.199> never<00:05:36.259> pluck<00:05:36.949> like

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
that's basically it I never pluck like

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.610 
that's basically it I never pluck like
at<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.120> top<00:05:38.360> of<00:05:38.539> my<00:05:38.659> brow<00:05:38.870> just<00:05:39.139> because<00:05:39.500> I

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
at the top of my brow just because I

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.100 
at the top of my brow just because I
feel<00:05:39.979> like<00:05:40.430> that<00:05:40.849> would<00:05:41.120> kind<00:05:41.509> of<00:05:41.570> mess<00:05:41.780> up<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
feel like that would kind of mess up the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.810 
feel like that would kind of mess up the
natural<00:05:42.289> arch<00:05:42.740> or<00:05:43.070> your<00:05:43.190> shape<00:05:43.430> or<00:05:43.729> whatever

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
natural arch or your shape or whatever

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.120 
natural arch or your shape or whatever
so<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.389> always<00:05:44.690> stay<00:05:45.139> down<00:05:45.469> below<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.979> brow

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
so I always stay down below the brow

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.010 
so I always stay down below the brow
yeah<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:46.789> that's<00:05:46.969> basically<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.599> it<00:05:47.840> probably

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
yeah so that's basically it it probably

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.010 
yeah so that's basically it it probably
takes<00:05:48.560> me<00:05:48.830> literally<00:05:49.550> only<00:05:50.270> about<00:05:50.479> three

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
takes me literally only about three

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.510 
takes me literally only about three
minutes<00:05:51.199> to<00:05:51.380> do<00:05:51.469> my<00:05:51.530> eyebrows<00:05:51.979> every<00:05:52.190> single

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
minutes to do my eyebrows every single

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.610 
minutes to do my eyebrows every single
day<00:05:52.639> I<00:05:52.880> don't<00:05:53.270> spend<00:05:53.840> too<00:05:53.930> much<00:05:54.080> time<00:05:54.139> on<00:05:54.469> there

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
day I don't spend too much time on there

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880
