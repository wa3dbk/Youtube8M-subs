about<00:00:04.620> water<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.640> get<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> lot<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.299> questions

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
about water I get a lot of questions

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.620 
about water I get a lot of questions
about<00:00:06.899> what<00:00:07.770> kind<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> water<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.880> drink<00:00:09.269> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
about what kind of water I drink and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.780 
about what kind of water I drink and
what<00:00:09.780> kind<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:09.990> water<00:00:10.290> filtration<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.280> method

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
what kind of water filtration a method

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.839 
what kind of water filtration a method
we<00:00:11.940> use<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.480> our<00:00:12.599> house<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.429> start<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
we use at our house and so to start I

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.400 
we use at our house and so to start I
want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> tell<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> used<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.900> water

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
want to tell you I used a water

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.620 
want to tell you I used a water
distiller<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.640> eight<00:00:17.850> years

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
distiller for eight years

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.840 
distiller for eight years
and<00:00:18.720> I'm<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.439> big<00:00:19.590> fan<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.859> distillers<00:00:20.400> they

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
and I'm a big fan of distillers they

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.340 
and I'm a big fan of distillers they
strip<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.359> everything<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> water

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
strip up everything out of the water

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
strip up everything out of the water
they<00:00:22.470> give<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> pure<00:00:22.980> h2o<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:24.119> main<00:00:24.269> thing

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
they give you pure h2o the main thing

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.670 
they give you pure h2o the main thing
with<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> distilleries<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> need<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> add

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
with the distilleries you need to add

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
with the distilleries you need to add
sea<00:00:26.160> salt<00:00:26.490> back<00:00:27.029> into<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> water<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sea salt back into the water to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.519 
sea salt back into the water to
remineralize<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.830> okay<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.630> after<00:00:31.380> eight

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
remineralize it okay so but after eight

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
remineralize it okay so but after eight
years<00:00:31.560> our<00:00:32.040> distiller<00:00:32.430> started<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> leak<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
years our distiller started to leak and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.299 
years our distiller started to leak and
so<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.020> had<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.440> make<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> decision<00:00:35.070> by<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
so we had to make a decision by the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.360 
so we had to make a decision by the
distiller<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:36.620> maybe<00:00:37.620> buy<00:00:37.860> something<00:00:38.250> else

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
distiller or maybe buy something else

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
distiller or maybe buy something else
well<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.840> last<00:00:40.050> few<00:00:40.379> years<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.890> kept

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
well in the last few years I kept

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.770 
well in the last few years I kept
reading<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.700> hearing<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> good<00:00:42.570> things

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
reading and hearing a lot of good things

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.220 
reading and hearing a lot of good things
about<00:00:42.899> murky<00:00:43.739> water<00:00:44.129> filter<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.230> after

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
about murky water filter and so after

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
about murky water filter and so after
enough<00:00:46.410> research<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.280> became

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
enough research I really became

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.439 
enough research I really became
convinced<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:48.989> amazing<00:00:50.449> device

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
convinced that it was an amazing device

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
convinced that it was an amazing device
for<00:00:52.230> lack<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:52.590> word<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> got

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
for lack of a better word and and we got

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
for lack of a better word and and we got
one<00:00:54.539> last<00:00:54.719> year<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.250> we've<00:00:56.489> been<00:00:56.610> using<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
one last year and so we've been using it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
one last year and so we've been using it
for<00:00:57.120> almost<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.840> year<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.770> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
for almost a year now and I think it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.849 
for almost a year now and I think it's
about<00:00:59.670> time<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> explain<00:01:00.870> why<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> love

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
about time for me to explain why I love

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
about time for me to explain why I love
it<00:01:02.010> why<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> best<00:01:03.149> water

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it why I think it's the best water

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.370 
it why I think it's the best water
filtration<00:01:04.379> system<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.549> there<00:01:05.610> okay<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
filtration system out there okay so this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.859 
filtration system out there okay so this
is<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.100> Berkey<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.510> what's<00:01:09.659> called<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
is the Berkey we have what's called the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
is the Berkey we have what's called the
big<00:01:10.080> berkey<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.560> two<00:01:10.799> gallon<00:01:11.130> model<00:01:11.460> there's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
big berkey it's two gallon model there's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
big berkey it's two gallon model there's
five<00:01:12.360> reasons<00:01:12.780> why<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> best

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
five reasons why I think it's the best

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
five reasons why I think it's the best
you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> buy<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.000> first<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.960> Berkey

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you can buy the first one is the Berkey

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
you can buy the first one is the Berkey

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
okay 99.99% it also has an extra

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.530 
okay 99.99% it also has an extra

95% of fluoride and arsenic that may be
in<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.390> water<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.430> all<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.240> less

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
in your water and all the way to to less

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.980 
in your water and all the way to to less
than<00:01:51.840> 50<00:01:52.290> parts<00:01:52.680> per<00:01:52.770> billion<00:01:53.130> which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.490> an

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
than 50 parts per billion which is an

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.040 
than 50 parts per billion which is an
unbelievably<00:01:54.990> tiny<00:01:55.290> amount

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
unbelievably tiny amount

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.230

right so the third reason is it doesn't
take<00:02:35.110> any<00:02:35.320> electricity<00:02:35.890> or<00:02:36.130> water<00:02:36.310> pressure

now those two little white filters those
are<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> fluoride<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.090> arsenic<00:02:58.420> filters<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
are the fluoride and arsenic filters the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.770 
are the fluoride and arsenic filters the
main<00:02:59.710> two<00:02:59.980> filters<00:03:00.459> are<00:03:00.850> actually<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.540> top

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
main two filters are actually in the top

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
for it okay so no electricity no water

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.250 
for it okay so no electricity no water
pressure<00:03:09.100> which<00:03:09.640> is<00:03:09.790> great<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.840> take<00:03:11.140> it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
pressure which is great you can take it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.350 
pressure which is great you can take it
with<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.830> portable<00:03:12.160> we<00:03:12.370> take<00:03:12.580> ours<00:03:12.790> took

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
us on vacation last year the water

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.090 
us on vacation last year the water
tastes<00:03:16.239> amazing<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.440> claimed<00:03:17.770> pure

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
tastes amazing and it's claimed pure

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
tastes amazing and it's claimed pure
water<00:03:18.340> also<00:03:18.700> this<00:03:19.330> does<00:03:19.540> not<00:03:19.660> strip<00:03:20.050> out

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
water also this does not strip out

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.320 
water also this does not strip out
minerals<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.250> leaves<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.760> water<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.209> a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
minerals so it leaves the water in a

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.100 
minerals so it leaves the water in a
neutral<00:03:22.810> pH<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.650> very<00:03:23.830> important<00:03:25.110> it's

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
neutral pH which is very important it's

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.380 
neutral pH which is very important it's
extremely<00:03:26.640> economical<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.060> reason

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
extremely economical so this is reason

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.860 
extremely economical so this is reason
number<00:03:28.420> four<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.100> big<00:03:30.370> berkey<00:03:30.870> it's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
two gallons there they make smaller ones

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.910 
two gallons there they make smaller ones
they<00:03:34.330> make<00:03:34.480> bigger<00:03:34.690> ones<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.709> this

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
they make bigger ones but this

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.310 
they make bigger ones but this
particular<00:03:36.370> model<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.670> about<00:03:36.760> 250<00:03:37.540> bucks<00:03:37.720> and

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
anyway works very fast so the reason we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.740 
anyway works very fast so the reason we
have<00:05:02.710> this<00:05:02.950> model<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.520> there's<00:05:04.390> four<00:05:04.570> people

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750

so it's the perfect size give a bigger
family<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.160> might<00:05:09.280> want<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.580> bigger<00:05:09.790> one<00:05:10.830> what
