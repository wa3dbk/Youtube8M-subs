00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

start<00:00:00.570> by<00:00:00.690> cutting<00:00:00.870> six<00:00:01.260> diamond<00:00:01.740> shaped

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
start by cutting six diamond shaped

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.190 
start by cutting six diamond shaped
pieces<00:00:02.250> out<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.610> some<00:00:02.760> printed<00:00:03.090> fabric<00:00:03.540> this

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
pieces out of some printed fabric this

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.019 
pieces out of some printed fabric this
is<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> good<00:00:04.620> way<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.830> use<00:00:05.040> up<00:00:05.069> some<00:00:05.400> old<00:00:05.580> fabric

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
is a good way to use up some old fabric

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.049 
is a good way to use up some old fabric
scraps<00:00:13.009> then<00:00:14.009> cut<00:00:14.250> your<00:00:14.429> two<00:00:14.549> triangular

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
scraps then cut your two triangular

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.310 
scraps then cut your two triangular
pieces<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.960> some<00:00:16.139> white<00:00:16.350> fabric<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:21.320> then

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
pieces out of some white fabric and then

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
pieces out of some white fabric and then
cut<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> four<00:00:22.830> odd<00:00:23.010> shaped<00:00:23.369> pieces<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
cut the four odd shaped pieces out of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
cut the four odd shaped pieces out of
white<00:00:24.330> fabric<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.590> next<00:00:31.710> just

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
white fabric as well so next just

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
white fabric as well so next just
assemble<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.550> quilt<00:00:32.820> pieces<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
assemble your quilt pieces in the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.299 
assemble your quilt pieces in the
general<00:00:33.719> shape<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> star<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.190> then

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
general shape of the star and then

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.440 
general shape of the star and then
you'll<00:00:35.430> pin<00:00:35.579> them<00:00:35.700> together<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> sew<00:00:36.420> them

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
you'll pin them together and sew them

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.299 
you'll pin them together and sew them
all<00:00:36.719> together<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.620> generally<00:00:43.920> easiest

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
all together so it's generally easiest

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
all together so it's generally easiest
if<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.520> start<00:00:44.760> by<00:00:44.910> sewing<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> six<00:00:45.539> diamond

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
if you start by sewing the six diamond

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.940 
if you start by sewing the six diamond
points<00:00:46.170> together<00:00:46.350> along<00:00:46.860> their<00:00:47.129> inner<00:00:47.309> points

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
points together along their inner points

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.200 
points together along their inner points
so<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.430> by<00:00:50.520> taking<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so you just start by taking two of the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
so you just start by taking two of the
diamonds<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> putting<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.190> right

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
diamonds and putting them the right

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
diamonds and putting them the right
sides<00:00:53.640> together<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sides together and then you're just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
sides together and then you're just
going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> sew<00:00:55.920> along<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.430> edge<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
going to sew along one edge of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.709 
going to sew along one edge of the
diamond<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.059> pattern<00:01:00.420> gives<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
diamond and so this pattern gives you a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.760 
diamond and so this pattern gives you a
quarter<00:01:01.199> inch<00:01:01.410> seam<00:01:01.710> allowance

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.720 

so<00:01:09.770> then<00:01:09.890> once<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:10.160> get<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> thread<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.610> tied

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
so then once you get the thread is tied

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.350 
so then once you get the thread is tied
off<00:01:11.030> on<00:01:11.210> that<00:01:11.330> one<00:01:11.480> just<00:01:12.230> open<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.620> back<00:01:12.800> up<00:01:13.010> and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
off on that one just open it back up and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.850 
off on that one just open it back up and
then<00:01:14.360> you'll<00:01:14.480> put<00:01:14.690> another<00:01:15.080> piece<00:01:15.470> another

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
then you'll put another piece another

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.000 
then you'll put another piece another
diamond<00:01:16.310> with<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.120> right<00:01:17.300> sides<00:01:17.570> together

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
diamond with the right sides together

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.500 
diamond with the right sides together
then<00:01:19.010> you're<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.550> right<00:01:20.090> down<00:01:20.270> along

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
then you're just so right down along

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:31.480 
then you're just so right down along
that<00:01:20.690> line<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.770> something<00:01:31.070> will<00:01:31.190> just<00:01:31.340> keep

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
that line and something will just keep

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.920 
that line and something will just keep
going<00:01:31.790> around<00:01:31.910> like<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.360> adding<00:01:32.780> each

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
going around like that adding each

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.330 
going around like that adding each
diamond<00:01:33.230> in<00:01:33.530> until<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.890> get<00:01:34.040> all<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
diamond in until you get all the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.640 
diamond in until you get all the
diamonds<00:01:34.670> sewn<00:01:34.850> together<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:36.530> we

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
diamonds sewn together and so here we

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.920 
diamonds sewn together and so here we
have<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.890> full<00:01:37.070> ep<00:01:37.220> star<00:01:37.880> number<00:01:38.570> just<00:01:38.720> going

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
have the full ep star number just going

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.500 
have the full ep star number just going
to<00:01:39.050> add<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.470> triangle<00:01:42.850> onto<00:01:43.850> each<00:01:44.000> side<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
to add a triangle onto each side of the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.300 
to add a triangle onto each side of the
star<00:01:44.810> we'll<00:01:45.290> just<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.620> those<00:01:45.800> right<00:01:46.040> in<00:01:46.070> there

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
star we'll just so those right in there

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.930 
star we'll just so those right in there
the<00:01:46.400> same<00:01:46.610> way<00:01:47.470> by<00:01:48.470> matching<00:01:48.650> up<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.220> two

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
the same way by matching up the two

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.330 
the same way by matching up the two
edges<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.540> sewing<00:01:50.810> along<00:01:50.930> here<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.530> then<00:01:52.220> of

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
edges and sewing along here and then of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.740 
edges and sewing along here and then of
course<00:01:52.369> once<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.790> site<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.090> sewed<00:01:53.360> you'll

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
course once the site of sewed you'll

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.050 
course once the site of sewed you'll
just<00:01:53.900> match<00:01:54.110> up<00:01:54.160> these<00:01:55.160> two<00:01:55.340> edges<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.850> so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
just match up these two edges and so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.760 
just match up these two edges and so
long<00:01:56.270> here<00:01:56.570> you'll<00:01:57.020> end<00:01:57.200> up<00:01:57.260> for<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.470> triangle

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.790 

and<00:02:04.479> then<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.600> course<00:02:05.630> you'll<00:02:06.020> sew<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.500> odd

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
and then of course you'll sew in the odd

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.640 
and then of course you'll sew in the odd
shaped<00:02:07.190> pieces<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.170> once<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
shaped pieces so once you have the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.220 
shaped pieces so once you have the
initial<00:02:12.980> design<00:02:13.310> finished<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:15.200> a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
initial design finished make a

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.990 
initial design finished make a
measurement<00:02:15.620> from<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.920> end<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.790> quilt

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
measurement from the end of the quilt

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.759 
measurement from the end of the quilt
top<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> center<00:02:18.980> seam<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.670> pillow<00:02:19.910> and

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
top to the center seam of the pillow and

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.050 
top to the center seam of the pillow and
then<00:02:21.769> you'll<00:02:21.920> add<00:02:22.070> half<00:02:22.400> an<00:02:22.519> inch<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.820> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
then you'll add half an inch to that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.960 
then you'll add half an inch to that
width<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.769> my<00:02:24.890> pillow<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> two-inch

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
width so on my pillow I have a two-inch

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.940 
width so on my pillow I have a two-inch
gap<00:02:26.209> between<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.660> center<00:02:26.900> seam<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.830> edge

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
gap between the center seam and the edge

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.970 
gap between the center seam and the edge
of<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.220> top<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.959> adding<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.290> half<00:02:30.500> an<00:02:30.590> inch<00:02:30.769> my

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
of the top so adding the half an inch my

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.110 
of the top so adding the half an inch my
measurement<00:02:31.370> will<00:02:31.459> be<00:02:31.550> two<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> half

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
measurement will be two and a half

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.229 
measurement will be two and a half
inches<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.220> measure<00:02:34.459> across<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.000> entire

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
inches so now measure across the entire

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.970 
inches so now measure across the entire
top<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.810> add<00:02:35.959> two<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.380> half<00:02:36.500> inches<00:02:36.709> to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
top and add two and a half inches to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.040 
top and add two and a half inches to
each<00:02:37.130> side<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.730> my<00:02:38.300> measurement<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.810> 10

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
each side and my measurement is 10

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.810 
each side and my measurement is 10
inches<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.920> adding<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> two<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.550> half<00:02:40.700> on

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
inches so adding the two and a half on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.530 
inches so adding the two and a half on
each<00:02:40.850> side<00:02:41.209> i<00:02:41.239> end<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.570> with<00:02:41.630> 15<00:02:42.110> inches<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.420> i'm

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
each side i end up with 15 inches so i'm

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.300 
each side i end up with 15 inches so i'm
going<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> end<00:02:44.900> up<00:02:44.930> cutting<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.470> 15<00:02:46.070> inch

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
going to end up cutting to 15 inch

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.340 
going to end up cutting to 15 inch
pieces<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.940> for<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.180> top<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.110> for<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
pieces one for the top and one for the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.340 
pieces one for the top and one for the
bottom<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:50.300> so<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.720> cut<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> piece<00:02:51.140> for

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
bottom and so then you cut a piece for

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.140 
bottom and so then you cut a piece for
each<00:02:51.410> side<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> top<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.790> time<00:02:52.850> you

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
each side of the top but this time you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.600 
each side of the top but this time you
only<00:02:53.180> add<00:02:53.600> one<00:02:53.930> inch<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.470> each<00:02:54.590> side<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.430> since

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
only add one inch to each side so since

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.009 
only add one inch to each side so since
my<00:02:55.670> measurement<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.360> top<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.810> 10<00:02:56.989> inches

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
my measurement of the top is 10 inches

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.650 
my measurement of the top is 10 inches
i'll<00:02:57.590> cut<00:02:58.010> an<00:02:58.190> 11<00:02:58.610> inch<00:02:58.790> piece<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.269> each<00:02:59.300> side

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
i'll cut an 11 inch piece for each side

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.380 
i'll cut an 11 inch piece for each side
and<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:01.190> course<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.519> pieces<00:03:01.790> will<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.120> two

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
and of course these pieces will be two

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.699 
and of course these pieces will be two
and<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.540> half<00:03:02.690> inches<00:03:02.870> wide<00:03:03.170> because<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.620> was

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
and a half inches wide because that was

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.170 
and a half inches wide because that was
my<00:03:03.830> initial<00:03:03.980> measurement<00:03:04.519> from<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.850> top<00:03:05.150> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
my initial measurement from the top to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.470 
my initial measurement from the top to
the<00:03:05.330> center<00:03:05.660> seam<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:08.239> you'll<00:03:08.360> just

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the center seam and so then you'll just

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.350 
the center seam and so then you'll just
so<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:08.959> those<00:03:09.080> pieces<00:03:09.380> under<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.160> top<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
so all those pieces under the top and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.920 
so all those pieces under the top and
then<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.230> end<00:03:12.410> up<00:03:12.560> with<00:03:12.680> this
