00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.829
 to money but there are hifi headphones 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.689
 the costs are so much at amazon because 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.210
 This time simply much shorter than at 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.500
 amazon always ships in a 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.480

 yes cool thing actually relatively good 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.720
 The data should be exceptionally good 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.970
 be headphones too 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.299
 for the price it usually is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.440
 99 euros do not expect so much 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.760
 So let's have a look at the headphones 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.760
 view that aside 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.049
 Here are the good things 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.610
 so one can also fold up nice and small 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.680
 if you see here 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:42.709
 so belong to the moment so they are sitting then 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.519
 later on the head less yes no 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.230
 cable to it 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.640
 that is because they have the 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.640
 cable connection here 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.890
 Here you are at two 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:05.510
 different are just beautiful left 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:09.890
 right and which are flexible here and 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.090
 then stop here in the joint and here 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.090
 you can postpone that well 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.000
 good thing 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.880
 then we'll see what else was there 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.410
 was such a little Catholic 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:36.900
 warendorfer are the two cables 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:39.900
 the adapter and the bag yes here so 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.260
 a faux leather bag if you're upset 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.350
 to take with you 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.350
 no cable for me 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.100
 the massive 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.730
 once so long cable here 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.490
 the connection to the device sees 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:09.390
 From Martine he wants 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.390
 is not spicy 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.740
 I 'm going to turn there you can 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:25.990
 adapter on it turn here 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.690
 and yes that does not fit into the iphone 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.460
 in fact relatively safe there you have to 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.990
 an extension piece or a 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:38.100
 switch adapter in between and the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.860
 Connection to the headphones 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.800
 here's a train two little hooks so 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.210
 the right and the right position 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.340
 need to be rotated to replace the 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.280
 stuck in the heads inside that's the three 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.950
 meter long cable here and that is one 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.430
 fine school spiral cable i know 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.460
 Earlier, the horny hifi had headphones 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.580
 Everyone had such a thing of grandpa 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.350
 sennheiser he has I believe which yes 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.250
 also here so the headphone connection with 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:13.620
 this hook and here is the paw 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.620
 adapter for 63 already screwed on it 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:23.460
 also plug it in here on the left it becomes 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.460
 plugged in 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.130
 really nice 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.790
 and then you just turn and then you are 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:42.040
 you do not get stuck out of here yes 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:45.310
 hole story I will what that 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.900
 I will definitely do things unboxing 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:53.100
 again review the next one two 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.380
 I'll definitely hear them every day 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.740
 Extensive sample and then I say what I 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.030
 think of it if we recommend it 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.030
