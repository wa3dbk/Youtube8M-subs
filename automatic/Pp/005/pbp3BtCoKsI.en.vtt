00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.120
 its legend% then you are 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.899
 a few areas still flooded with football peeling a little bit the piece of 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.899
 delight 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.609
 the sporty past to make a 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.909
 bahrein foreground of Italian austerity that schengen agreements you 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.400
 have a little bit maybe worked but when i 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 I am very bad effect at the holidays 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.710
 the past 22 agreements a soldier 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.750
 and I'm here I do not even know what it's because I'm good and in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.760
 rescue 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.090
 so do 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 rated this article done in slow motion 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 so 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.860
 so relay the plugs 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 so for you then what is both what I find super important 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 in this direction 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.950
 in this piece you opted I'll see that moment 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 right hand that side 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.330
 basta 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 a little crazy 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.940
 so good thing you do it a little bit that accelerated this cetacean is 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.939
 difficult to play in slow motion it breaks a little bit 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 group and benchmarks are not harmed 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 so my son flat 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.159
 the trial of a little bit 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.069
 and then place this saturday sales 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.700
 a little more detail to post a video of the pleasures go to hide 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:21.489
