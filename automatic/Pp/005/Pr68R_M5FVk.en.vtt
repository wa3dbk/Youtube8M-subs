their own dogs twitching or whimpering

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
their own dogs twitching or whimpering
in<00:01:58.229> their<00:01:58.350> sleep<00:01:58.820> dogs<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.360> brain

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
in their sleep dogs have the same brain

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
in their sleep dogs have the same brain
wave<00:02:00.869> bands<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.380> humans<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.100> while<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.490> sleep

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
wave bands as humans do while we sleep

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420 
wave bands as humans do while we sleep
so<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.360> dream<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.280> what

so they dream just like we do but what
is<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.729> surprising<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> fact<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.840> not

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
is more surprising is the fact that not

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.529 
is more surprising is the fact that not
all<00:02:07.200> dogs<00:02:07.680> during<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> same<00:02:08.280> amount<00:02:08.610> small
