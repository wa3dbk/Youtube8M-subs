00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
forever it's like you know how to build

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.219 
forever it's like you know how to build
a<00:01:42.820> gateway<00:01:43.119> experience<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.869> sort<00:01:44.140> of

a gateway experience that sort of

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.020 
a gateway experience that sort of
through<00:01:44.799> gameplay<00:01:45.039> pushes<00:01:45.549> people<00:01:45.670> into

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
through gameplay pushes people into

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.310

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
band one where that simulation was a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.560 
band one where that simulation was a
less<00:03:29.660> abstract<00:03:30.200> than<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:31.190> guitar<00:03:31.540> you<00:03:32.540> know

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
less abstract than the guitar you know

with<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:38.030> same<00:03:38.239> mentality<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:39.019> oh<00:03:39.170> we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
with that same mentality of like oh we
