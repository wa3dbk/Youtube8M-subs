00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
take it off but yeah I've actually seen

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.309 
take it off but yeah I've actually seen
the<00:02:22.939> movie<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.359> this<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.900> heard<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.200> book

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
the movie for this and I heard the book

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.229 
the movie for this and I heard the book
was<00:02:24.439> different<00:02:24.769> from<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.189> movie<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:25.819> books

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
was different from the movie and books

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.550 
was different from the movie and books
are<00:02:26.389> always<00:02:26.569> better<00:02:26.689> than<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.109> movie<00:02:27.349> right

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
are always better than the movie right

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.869 
are always better than the movie right
so<00:02:28.010> i<00:02:28.040> thought<00:02:28.250> i<00:02:28.310> would<00:02:28.370> pick<00:02:28.549> this<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.819> up

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
so i thought i would pick this one up

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.520 
so i thought i would pick this one up
next<00:02:29.269> one<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.450> my<00:02:29.569> brother<00:02:29.840> got<00:02:30.200> for<00:02:30.379> me<00:02:30.500> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
next one of my brother got for me I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.649 
next one of my brother got for me I
books<00:02:30.829> million<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.609> it<00:02:31.760> was<00:02:31.969> only<00:02:32.180> four

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
books million and it was only four

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.179 
books million and it was only four
dollars<00:02:32.689> so<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.290> was<00:02:33.379> a<00:02:33.439> really<00:02:33.590> good<00:02:33.799> deal<00:02:33.950> and

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
dollars so it was a really good deal and

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.390 
dollars so it was a really good deal and
it<00:02:34.340> was<00:02:34.549> Juliet<00:02:35.299> immortal<00:02:35.750> by<00:02:35.900> stacy<00:02:36.290> j<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:37.370> is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it was Juliet immortal by stacy j it is

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.479 
it was Juliet immortal by stacy j it is
hard<00:02:38.090> cover<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.319> if<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.829> want<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.129> get<00:02:40.340> this

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
hard cover so if you want to go get this

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.520 
hard cover so if you want to go get this
i<00:02:40.760> would<00:02:40.969> go<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.120> books-a-million<00:02:41.659> it<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.200> like

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
i would go to books-a-million it is like

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.339 
i would go to books-a-million it is like
four<00:02:42.950> dollars<00:02:43.519> in<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.909> bargain<00:02:44.540> section<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
four dollars in the bargain section so I

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.780 
four dollars in the bargain section so I
don't<00:02:45.590> really<00:02:45.650> know<00:02:45.950> much<00:02:46.159> about<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.579> one

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
don't really know much about this one

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.300 
don't really know much about this one
but<00:02:47.359> it<00:02:47.599> has<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.139> do<00:02:48.319> with<00:02:48.620> Romeo<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.040> Juliet

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
but it has to do with Romeo and Juliet

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.009 
but it has to do with Romeo and Juliet
so<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.760> next<00:02:49.879> one<00:02:50.000> christina<00:02:50.480> was<00:02:50.599> also<00:02:50.810> kind

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
so the next one christina was also kind

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.440 
so the next one christina was also kind
enough<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.349> send<00:02:51.530> me<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.159> is<00:02:52.400> delirium<00:02:53.299> by

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
