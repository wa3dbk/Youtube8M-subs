00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to all my name is chameleon and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.990
 today I'm going to draw you my life 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.179
 so it all started in a jungle 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
 okay or 1979 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.530
 I was born artists my parents put 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.889
 a lot of time to choose my 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.929
 first name 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 Dad wanted to call me calm and mom 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.680
 have them then I do not know why 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.910
 but they ended up calling me chameleon 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.650
 when I was little I drew 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.039

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.689
 the world took for link and as 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 I had weird hair we were taking 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 for andy warhol but all right for 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.340
 to say that his two passions I loved 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.129
 I painted the walls of my room but 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 rain it snows 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.590
 holidays I draw and all the time 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 even at school my office was a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.470
 drawing sheet 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.549
 a moment when the sheets of paper do not 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 enough more I went out on the street 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.409
 and I found new surfaces 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 to express my art I discovered the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.360
 paint bombs and I started to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.040

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.759
 police 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 there I saw myself sharing a burger 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.850
 with the Commissioner who had 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.230
 and then at one point I told myself this 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.910
 want to draw all the time it takes 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.440

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.600
