00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 We are going to make a dish with these little things so small, they are gnocchi and we are going to 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.239
 to make with prawns 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:14.049
 This recipe is especially delicate and very soft because it has cream, and the gnocchi 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.689
 They are like some masitas made of potato also very soft and delicate 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.589
 What I like most about this recipe is the final texture of the dish 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.050
 It's super simple, let's do it with olive oil 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.450
 we put the oil to heat, and when we are warm we throw 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.080
 onion; let it go sautÃ©ing and pochando. And when it's transparent 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.860
 we add prawns 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.770
 I used frozen to make it a more economical dish, and when I'm 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.260
 everything in its point, we add the cream to cook 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 to the cream we are going to add salt and pepper, and we are going to let it be linked with the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.740
 rest of the ingredients a little while 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.540
 when we see that it is well linked, we add the gnocchi 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.930
 we cooked the gnocchi before, it is the first step 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.760
 follow the package instructions is super easy 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 and we let it cook with this delicious cream about 10 minutillos 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.810
 and finished It's done! 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.260
 we only have left 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.060
 eat 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.090
 already done 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 we only have one more touch of pepper and eat!
