00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.950
 hello everyone with you flashpoint freedoms 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.130
 review 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.200
 what are all the same shoulder short chapter 7 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.320
 only and on that side for which 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.500
 did not really show anything interesting 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.369
 there was a puppy chatter flashback well and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.519
 In general, all proceed to the review game 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.730
 patch day sword and killed him as a shinigami 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.850
 this seems to be talked about and maybe 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.930
 No, I personally do not remember if I 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 nerd will earlier then excuse me but 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.290
 For me, for the first time, the berry is surprised game 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.019
 patches did such a must killed run away 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.940
 long ago raised his sword from his sword 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.739
 achieved the title of captain 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.689
 This is commendable in general, but where is the louse? 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.689
 no less happily he was an ordinary soul 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:09.049
 did not become books his sword knife was 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.119
 appear own but see it this 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.939
 uns auch and thatâ€™s what you will be 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.030
 and it is to them your all probably not 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.130
 due to their different fights joy or 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.200
 differently appears well and we will 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.680
 hope that u kim patches will hiccups 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.090
 the jar is very strong like him and immediately 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.100
 apologizing for the release started ht said that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.920
 ichigo has spent kurosaki on the very 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 In fact, he had the last name Shiba from the clan and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.850
 those are good for my husband where is my girlfriend with 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.170
 catapults that are thrown and check and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.750
 to his friends to 313 where they sent 0 and from 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 up and toshiba 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.600
 and they kinda refers to know some 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.330
 but protecting the receipt is not easy 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.010
 cant rally anyone data to know 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.070
 relates well, how can it be without it 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.310
 and said that he took at least from his mother 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.150
 and they said that in Japan they take faith 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.160
 mothers not 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.440
 this theory is based only on the people 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.380
 there the third hokage gave such a last name 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 people but only because you are not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.360
 knew that he was the son of a hokage anyway 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.670
 all thats the whole point and therefore from the currency 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.550
 T-shirts if you wanted like this 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.180
 would know that his namikaze was free 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.910
 it would be with you dini minato and all but so 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.610
 it turned out we are here in what sense 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.220
 a situation it is not likely to 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.040
 searched he took my last name kurosaki 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.600
 and therefore what kurosaki got 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.270
 it's possible so early to talk about it 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.900
 because he is the only father 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.420
 Now stock to find out what is there 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.810
 happens after all killed already three shinigami 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.990
 and eventually goes to the sound that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.390
 learns how and how 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.200
 zine's plan he's saying that I knew that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.120
 they meet you appear you gave 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.330
 explode come back to be all empty 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.489
 he knew everything perfectly he scandal him all 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.750
 reacted and everything he had 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.230
 scheduled 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.810
 how could it be otherwise and in the end everything becomes 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.630
 clearer means the appraiser on the canister 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.550
 wolves or shallow avoider 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.970
 total technicians who think that 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.959
 died because how they ging products 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.840
 aizen and 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.180
 3 dude blind tools he seems to be if not 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.980
 I am mistaken and from a visor 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.100
 the results are bad that we are not 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.930
 it turns out to make empty people 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.300
 you know no empty together but soon 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.110
 viser you will be out and most likely 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.380
 the wiser mentioned his mother and what came 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.500
 and and perry walked with ease though 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.130
 the appraiser was the captain let everything be 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.340
 so I do not mind you will be flow plus 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.489
 this spice and would be nicer 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.970
 more interesting also I like panning 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.270
 in this chapter she is smart rangiku 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.180
 looks very beautiful to mind 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.530
 eyes glisten the other side in place 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.630
 everything seems to be nishtyak looks beautiful 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.790
 cute even a little kid who 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.740
 seeks to become captain and he 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.750
 making your progress where dad and chika 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.660
 He says it is possible that you will be 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.850
 why the captain after me and saunas like 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.140
 would run off into the world and and maybe after 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.240
 this incident ion become 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.510
 captain because he will not return 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.130
 in this render it will be possible so 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.190
 this should probably be seen on 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.400
 next week on wednesday as well as arizona 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.770
 his plan and everything like that all the more 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.890
 the main enemy came after him 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.080
 prison but did not give consent, and as spoke 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.290
 the lip itself because of you will still show so 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.090
 maybe start running will do any 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.280
 stuff and and ichigo then with new powers 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:11.060
 will beat him again and will be a hero and on 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.490
 this will end well, it will be possible and so 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.120
 but it's still guesswork and 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.760
 my imaginations 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.610
 Yes, many people in general but wait 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.710
 see and a couple of questions my listeners 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.470
 first question started the audio track 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.960
 there will be 2 sound tracks in a row now 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.260
 first sound track I'm talking now 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.480
 she goes with a cleared sound which without 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.520
 noises should be but voices in it 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.280
 solid to me it seems to you that 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.760
 monotonous there are no emotions exactly 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.280
 pronounced and stupidly goes as if the voice and 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.890
 everything 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.800
 2 track that goes now it is a niche 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.470
 no noise suppress more precisely noise 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.730
 I hear the surrounding there I do not know the wire 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.330
 maybe somewhere 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.760
 another room of the step will be heard 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.980
 maybe a little noise and some 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.550
 as a result , their voice zone loud somehow 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.620
 other tones and a lively voice goes which of 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.380
 you votes more about like to you 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.270
 track more like say about it 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.150
 and 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.400
 write in the comments under on u tube and i 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.000
 I will continue to do and take again 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.290
 track 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.670
 and all because it does longer than 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.030
 release more precisely 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.390
 processing it is not very big there minutes 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:39.340
 ten others to make you nicer 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:41.700
 listen and make it feel better for you 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.580
 because lively voice interest is nothing 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.520
 processed that computer but 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:53.770
 the advantage is all sound clear when i 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:58.900
 silent silence normal sound track 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:02.020
 when I am silent different noises can be 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.260
 some hiss they are a little unpleasant 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.770
 sit to on listen to release 05 10 in a row 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.820
 they start to bore little by 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.040
 at least when i release 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.880
 revise i hear the noise and go 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.890
 headphones and I think so worse for possible 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.230
 better because my voice is greater 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.040
 like and in the treated version especially 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.220
 like the voice 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.320
 but the sound track is clean and again 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.930
 the spirit of the tracks better write to 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.480
 comments on it all with you was 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.480
 flash pain see you soon
