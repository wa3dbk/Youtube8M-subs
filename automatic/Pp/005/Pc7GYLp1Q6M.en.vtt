00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.880 
great because the impossible girl had to
make<00:05:09.210> an<00:05:09.330> impossible<00:05:09.840> decision<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.500> didn't

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
make an impossible decision and didn't

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.620 
make an impossible decision and didn't
magically<00:05:11.130> know<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.730> answer<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:12.300> she<00:05:12.480> has

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
magically know the answer like she has

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.840 
magically know the answer like she has
done<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:12.930> previous<00:05:13.110> episodes<00:05:13.440> I<00:05:14.010> think<00:05:14.700> she

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
done in previous episodes I think she

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.100 
done in previous episodes I think she
handled<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.390> right<00:05:15.600> given<00:05:16.020> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
handled it all right given the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.440 
handled it all right given the
circumstances<00:05:16.920> putting<00:05:17.370> it<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.670> vote<00:05:17.940> added

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
circumstances putting it to a vote added

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:41.490 
circumstances putting it to a vote added
to<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.690> suspense

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.550 

I<00:05:42.000> liked<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.360> turned<00:05:44.020> all<00:05:44.230> their<00:05:44.380> lights

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
I liked that a turned all their lights

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.220 
I liked that a turned all their lights
out<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:45.330> don't<00:05:46.330> like<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:46.660> fact<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:46.960> they<00:05:47.170> were

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
out I don't like the fact that they were

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.200 
out I don't like the fact that they were
basically<00:05:47.800> signing<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.550> death<00:05:48.730> certificate

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
basically signing the death certificate

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.150 
basically signing the death certificate
of<00:05:49.300> this<00:05:49.450> brand<00:05:49.750> new<00:05:49.930> being<00:05:50.170> but<00:05:50.890> it<00:05:51.040> was

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
of this brand new being but it was

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.340 
of this brand new being but it was
accurate<00:05:51.400> earth<00:05:52.210> would<00:05:52.600> want<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:53.140> save

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
accurate earth would want to save

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.370

themselves<00:05:53.940> ourselves<00:05:54.940> at<00:05:55.330> first<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.750> felt<00:05:55.810> bad

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
themselves ourselves at first I felt bad

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.840

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
down there but then I thought well

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.170

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
drowned in the masses but my conscience

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.970 
drowned in the masses but my conscience
would<00:06:38.919> be<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.130> little<00:06:39.340> bit<00:06:39.580> clearer<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:41.800> I'd

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 
would be a little bit clearer and I'd

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.580 
would be a little bit clearer and I'd
want<00:06:42.190> to<00:06:42.280> see<00:06:42.460> what<00:06:42.730> was<00:06:42.820> in<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.180> egg<00:06:43.330> if<00:06:44.230> I<00:06:44.410> was

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.980 
I also admire the workmanship because
the<00:07:22.630> set<00:07:22.960> and<00:07:23.260> the<00:07:24.190> effects<00:07:24.550> were<00:07:24.850> amazing<00:07:25.000> but

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
the set and the effects were amazing but

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.110 
the set and the effects were amazing but
did<00:07:26.380> you<00:07:26.560> think<00:07:26.620> this<00:07:26.890> episode<00:07:27.400> was<00:07:27.640> the<00:07:27.850> Dark

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
did you think this episode was the Dark

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.110 
did you think this episode was the Dark
Side<00:07:28.360> of<00:07:28.419> the<00:07:28.600> Moon<00:07:28.720> or<00:07:29.110> sunny<00:07:29.560> side<00:07:29.890> up

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
Side of the Moon or sunny side up

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:38.690 
Side of the Moon or sunny side up
because<00:07:31.120> it's<00:07:31.270> the<00:07:31.419> moon<00:07:31.630> butter<00:07:31.900> egg

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:38.700 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.550 

was<00:07:39.700> that<00:07:40.000> suspicious<00:07:40.780> sound<00:07:41.080> and<00:07:41.350> noise

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
was that suspicious sound and noise

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.790 
was that suspicious sound and noise
coming<00:07:42.040> from<00:07:42.070> the<00:07:42.280> dark<00:07:42.490> ominous<00:07:42.820> house<00:07:43.300> I

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 
coming from the dark ominous house I

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.950 
coming from the dark ominous house I
should<00:07:44.800> probably<00:07:45.370> check<00:07:45.610> it<00:07:45.790> out<00:07:45.970> because

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 
should probably check it out because

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.810 
should probably check it out because
nothing<00:07:47.320> bad<00:07:47.560> will<00:07:47.770> happen<00:07:47.830> to<00:07:48.220> me<00:07:48.810> hello
