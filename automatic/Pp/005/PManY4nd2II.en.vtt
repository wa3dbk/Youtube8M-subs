00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:21.740
 prepare this rich cheese jelly 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:25.380
 Philadelphia a can of evaporated milk 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.000
 a can of condensed milk a cheese 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 cream philadelphia grenetina without flavor 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.980
 this is for philadelphia and jello 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 we are going to occupy a flavor jelly 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 stress is skin 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 here I have half a cup of water 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.540
 put 3 tablespoons of 15 milliliters if 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.430
 you use the sachets of 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.920
 Grenetine would be 4 sachets 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 I'm going to mix a little bit that resolves 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.470
 the negative in the water 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.850
 in what the grenetina is hydrated 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.850
 to go placing the milk 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.070
 This milk is like milk 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.780
 nothing else that is another brand to be 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.400
 finish with a spatula to get it right 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.300
 all because if there is a little bit more 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.670
 serious and we will not put water 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.670
 let's put cream cheese 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.049
 here is the victim is already hydrated 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.270
 we can see that it's already like that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.939
 sponge is hard call to put the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.159
 microwave for 10 seconds we bring it closer 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.130
 we revolve we put another 10 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.259
 seconds and so three times since we have 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 liquid from argentina let's put point 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.230
 for milk and cheese 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.230
 now we are going to liquefy 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.570
 and we liquefy now let's put in a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.660
 mold I put a little bit of oil 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.210
 of the oil that we use for cooking we go 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.820
 to put the mixture halfway or a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.700
 little above the middle, not what 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.220
 we are going to fill because we have to leave 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 space for the other gelatin we are going to 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.510
 attenuate refrigerate I'll wait for 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.570
 is well curd please do not be me 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.270
 despair this gelatin we can do the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.160
 night and in the morning we prepare the other 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.740
 we finish with the preparation 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.080
 you have to be patient because you have to 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.330
 be well curd this if they are not going 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.640
 to disrupt at the time of making the boot 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.530
 we're going to reserve it yet not the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.820
 let's prepare until it is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.940
 curd this 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.940
 I have these same crimes I am going to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.640
 do well and I'm going to put a little 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.130
 of oil the oil that I use for cooking 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.670
 this nothing else I put a little bit of the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.250
 finger and I'm going to remove the old people we 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.250
 Lets put 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 plant a little more than half 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.610
 to prepare our water jelly 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.610
 let's occupy 2 cups of hot water 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.650
 I'll put a packet of jelly I 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.360
 to stir to dissolve 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 perfectly in gelatin 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.690
 and I'm going to put a cup of cold water 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.180
 let's mix here nothing else we're 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.580
 using three cups if you want 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.560
 you can use the four that says the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.450
 gelatin that leads but I prefer that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.239
 the gelatin is a little firmer and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.670
 I put three cups nothing else let's go 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.739
 to wait for it to cool down in what 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.750
 finish the cheese gelatin 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.060
 I'm already getting cold and we're going to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.220
 put when it's completely cold there 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.440
 put it is warm do not despair 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.980
 because they're going to get rid of the cheese 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.200
 it has to be completely cold these 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 since the jelly is square 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.519
 Milk is already down and the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.030
 jelly of ambo now adds to be 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.519
 cold if your mold does not peel off like this 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.480
 easy what they are going to do is they are going to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.970
 put the mold will sit 10 seconds 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.790
 in hot water nothing but seconds 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.220
 so that it takes off and already and is already 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.739
 it's going to take off easy we're going to 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 take off what takes off a little 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.750
 from the bottom too 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.030
 but we're not going to just take it out 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.340
 be well taken off 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.340
 let's put the water jelly 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.070
 Let the water gelatin cover 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.140
 perfectly the cheese I will pass 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.200
 a spatula by the shore for 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.160
 make sure that between the water jelly 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.810
 to go to the bottom if you 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.280
 ensure that it is well detached from 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.980
 bottom gelatin there's no need to 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.650
 do this I move it and it looks like that 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.080
 Creatine is swimming that already 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.820
 is here swimming in the other gelatin the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.060
 I'm going to go back to the refrigerator so 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.830
 the water gelatin is set now let's go 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.320
 to do the same with these jellies 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.470
 we are also going to take them off this not 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.080
 I need one more eyebrow at a time it pulls and 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.950
 it takes off very easy 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.110
 now let's put the water jelly 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.820
 no German fifth time for shore so 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.100
 to take off a little bit to 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.400
 ensure that the gelatine has 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.260
 being swimming in the other without so that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.810
 we will not be stuck in the background 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.300
 and that we have two colors one above 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.580
 of work in this way we make sure 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.229
 that the gelatin is already swimming 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.090
 now I'm going to put the refrigerator 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.620
 again and wait for it to set there is no 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.090
 how rich are I already dying to eat it already 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.370
 let's disassemble to see how we 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.580
 was this delicious 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.620
 this mold has more handled and takes off 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.080
 I'm not going to put it in hot water 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.750
 because often the hot water we 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.240
 we pass and the gelatin melts do not 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.130
 I do not even want to put it on when it 's 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.960
 necessary good I do it in mold of 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.990
 glass that if it sticks not like a water 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.090
 hot but if I can avoid putting it on 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.530
 hot water I prefer not to put it too 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.630
 I hope I get it right today what a rich 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.530
 see that relocate gelatin 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.139
 today is delicious let's accommodate the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.990
 because it is a little bit small but 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:17.080
 ugly today this is a delight now well 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.270
 taken out other delicious little ones is 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.970
 divine, look, I did not need to 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.300
 put hot water nothing farther 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.160
 with the agro little of the walls that 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.820
 you hit today but this has to 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:34.240
 be very careful because if you 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.150
 suddenly if they break you can put 510 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.729
 seconds in hot water but like 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.080
 I tell them this one I do not want to risk that 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:45.909
 sometimes I pass the time and give 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.659
 but if there is no need to put and 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:54.430
 hot water nothing else let me out 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:56.860
 see what beauty I said is divine 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.710
 Well, I've finished disassembling my 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:04.200
 peanas and this see what sweetie now 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.200
 let's go to see how they are 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.520
 and well, this is how these rich 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:17.060
 Latinas though I'm going to split the other one today 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:20.180
 It's delicious and I do not want to eat it 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.789
 simply delicious and very easy to 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.560
 do but really to do it and
