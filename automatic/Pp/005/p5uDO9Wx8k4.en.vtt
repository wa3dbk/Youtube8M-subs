00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.410
(horn blows)

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.980
you're in the streets with death

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.120
and it would be your number that's up
in three or four seconds

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.540
and you don't know, you might not come
home that night

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.170
so it's it's a big decision

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.280
it's their last morning in the sun running
together before they go to the  bull ring

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.240
for their demise

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.480
you're joining their herd

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.000
your running with them, you're not running against them

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.000
It's an unbelievable, and unacceptably cruel sport

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
something needs to change, and we do need to stop it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.400
(host) Thrilling, detested, adored

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
this is the San Fermin Festival

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
where people come to run with bulls.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.890
The one thing about this,  is   there's no competition in it.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.500
the first thing you do after a run is you go up to somebody else and say

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.579
How did you do today man?

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
not OH, did you see me? Like most sports     and that's the difference

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.200
the camaraderie

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
(host) Ernest Hemingway described it as an explosion

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200
(Crowd Cheering)

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.170
sure enough, if you dare enter this throng it will blast you in all directions

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.100
I am absolutely Sh**ting myself

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.380
(Music)

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.000
(Host) but how has this tradition become a part of Pamplona?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.390
(Music)

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.200
and in the face a modern-day critics can
it survive?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
enter the blood red, sangria soaked festival

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.700
of Pamplona

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.240
(Music)

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.400
and if you're not scared, there is something wrong. You shouldn't be in here

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.700
(Music)
