don't have on her and no I don't I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.109 
don't have on her and no I don't I
don't<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.770> anyone<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.700> her<00:01:44.909> do

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
don't think anyone has on her do

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
don't think anyone has on her do
researchers<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.200> can't<00:01:46.500> find<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.950> good

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
researchers right now can't find a good

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.709 
researchers right now can't find a good
cure<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.549> cancer<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.030> she<00:01:48.179> says<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.539> she's

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
cure for cancer and she says that she's

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.539 
cure for cancer and she says that she's
found<00:01:48.960> something<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.429> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
found something so I think that it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.719 
found something so I think that it's
incredible<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:52.109> love<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.609> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
incredible and I really love that it's a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
incredible and I really love that it's a
woman<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.179> at<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.109> point<00:01:55.320> she's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.469> girl<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
woman or at this point she's a girl and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
woman or at this point she's a girl and
the<00:01:55.920> reason<00:01:56.159> why<00:01:56.249> I<00:01:56.280> say<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.969> because<00:01:56.999> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the reason why I say that is because a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.630 
the reason why I say that is because a
lot<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> girls<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.070> interested<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
lot of girls are not interested in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
lot of girls are not interested in
science<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.179> a<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.479> male-dominated<00:02:01.219> field

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
science it's a very male-dominated field

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.010 
science it's a very male-dominated field
and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.880> think<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.420> great<00:02:03.570> because

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and I think that it's great because

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.109 
and I think that it's great because
maybe<00:02:04.499> other<00:02:04.920> young<00:02:05.280> women<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:05.759> will

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
maybe other young women out there will

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.710 
maybe other young women out there will
look<00:02:06.270> at<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.539> story<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> say<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> know

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
maybe it's something that I should look
