kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> short<00:00:37.950> side<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.460> there's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
kind of on the short side but there's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.729 
kind of on the short side but there's
enough<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> keep<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> good<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.530> I'll

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
enough there to keep it good and I'll

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
enough there to keep it good and I'll
just<00:00:40.890> run<00:00:41.040> over<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.430> three<00:00:41.670> characters

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
just run over these three characters

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
just run over these three characters
here<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:43.620> I'll<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.040> into<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
here and then I'll get right into it and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
here and then I'll get right into it and
basically<00:00:45.450> I'll<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.899> able<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.379> more

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
basically I'll be able to go into more

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
basically I'll be able to go into more
depth<00:00:46.890> about<00:00:47.010> things<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> second<00:00:48.450> part

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
depth about things in the second part

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.060 
depth about things in the second part
because<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> first<00:00:49.260> date<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> short<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
because the first date is short in

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.049 
because the first date is short in
itself<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.539> anyway<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> ninja<00:00:53.640> who

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
itself but anyway we have the ninja who

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
itself but anyway we have the ninja who
was<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> biggest<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.809> strongest<00:00:54.930> character

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
was the biggest and strongest character

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
was the biggest and strongest character
and<00:00:56.160> he's<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> slowest<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:58.410> weighs<00:00:58.649> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and he's also the slowest he weighs so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
and he's also the slowest he weighs so
much<00:00:59.520> that<00:01:00.120> he<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.350> big<00:01:01.739> tub<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> lard

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
much that he is just a big tub of lard

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.840 
much that he is just a big tub of lard
and<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.589> am<00:01:04.589> NOT<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.010> him<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> think<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
this game you need to speed more than

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.660 
this game you need to speed more than
strength<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> he<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> kunoichi<00:01:10.670> I'm

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
not sure if I'm pronouncing these right

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859 
not sure if I'm pronouncing these right

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
so I apologize in advance she's the main

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.410 
so I apologize in advance she's the main
character<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.590> she's<00:01:17.009> average<00:01:17.250> she's<00:01:18.119> also

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
character and she's average she's also

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960 
character and she's average she's also
the<00:01:18.570> shortest<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.430> attacking<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> smallest

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the shortest so attacking the smallest

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
the shortest so attacking the smallest
enemies<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:21.840> easy<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.200> her<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
enemies is pretty easy for her and then

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.530 
enemies is pretty easy for her and then
you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> kama<00:01:24.570> Itachi

his name is translate to the sickle
weasel<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:29.900> appropriate<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.590> guess<00:01:30.620> it's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
weasel which is appropriate I guess it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.770

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
other two characters do it because the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.380 
other two characters do it because the
enemies<00:03:48.140> tend<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.410> jump<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.770> over<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.100> place

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
and it's not only that they're hard it's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.020 
and it's not only that they're hard it's
just<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.860> kind<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.130> waste<00:03:52.340> time<00:03:52.640> fighting
