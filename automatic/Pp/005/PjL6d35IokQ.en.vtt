00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
the world to spawn so don't think your

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.039 
the world to spawn so don't think your
minecraft<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:18.970> crashing<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.450> anything<00:02:19.840> it

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
minecraft is crashing or anything it

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.920 
minecraft is crashing or anything it
just<00:02:20.530> does<00:02:20.980> take<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> little<00:02:21.730> bit<00:02:21.879> longer<00:02:22.330> when

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
just does take a little bit longer when

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.390 
just does take a little bit longer when
you<00:02:23.019> guys<00:02:23.170> do<00:02:23.349> decide<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.769> have<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> bigger

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
you guys do decide to have a bigger

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.509 
you guys do decide to have a bigger
amount<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.390> blocks<00:02:25.720> being<00:02:25.989> spawned<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:27.280> I'm

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
amount of blocks being spawned so I'm

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.410 
amount of blocks being spawned so I'm
gonna<00:02:27.640> go<00:02:27.760> ahead<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.909> plate<00:02:28.180> through<00:02:28.360> our

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
gonna go ahead and plate through our

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.970 
gonna go ahead and plate through our
glass<00:02:28.690> layer<00:02:28.989> what<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> glass<00:02:29.500> layer<00:02:29.709> pretty

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
glass layer what the glass layer pretty

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.470 
glass layer what the glass layer pretty
much<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.459> just<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.730> little<00:02:30.849> layer<00:02:31.120> going

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
much is is just a little layer going

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
much is is just a little layer going
over<00:02:31.750> your<00:02:32.200> whole<00:02:32.410> world<00:02:32.650> it's<00:02:32.980> endless<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.580> it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
over your whole world it's endless so it

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.220 
over your whole world it's endless so it
will<00:02:33.819> keep<00:02:33.940> generating<00:02:34.209> with<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.750> world<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
will keep generating with the world and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
will keep generating with the world and
I<00:02:35.260> guess<00:02:36.069> it's<00:02:36.220> just<00:02:36.280> kind<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.640> acts<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:36.940> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
I guess it's just kind of acts like a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.000 
I guess it's just kind of acts like a
little<00:02:37.330> roof<00:02:37.569> those<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.530> guys<00:02:38.650> who<00:02:38.709> don't

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
little roof those of you guys who don't

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.440 
little roof those of you guys who don't
want<00:02:39.160> rain<00:02:39.519> even<00:02:39.790> though<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.000> could<00:02:40.269> just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
want rain even though you could just

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.180 
want rain even though you could just
turn<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.720> off<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.140> pretty<00:02:41.650> cool<00:02:41.829> though<00:02:42.040> so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
turn it off so pretty cool though so

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.229 
turn it off so pretty cool though so
we're<00:02:42.280> going<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.459> go<00:02:42.489> ahead<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.909> make<00:02:43.060> our<00:02:43.090> way

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
we're going to go ahead and make our way

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.030 
we're going to go ahead and make our way
down<00:02:43.329> here<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.110> when<00:02:44.409> we<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:44.739> way<00:02:44.769> right

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
down here and when we make our way right

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.640 
down here and when we make our way right
down<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.549> see<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.879> all<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.180> our<00:02:46.269> oars

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
down you can see that all of our oars

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.170 
down you can see that all of our oars
start<00:02:47.650> spawning<00:02:47.950> our<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.549> emerald<00:02:48.940> ores

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
start spawning our little emerald ores

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.240 
start spawning our little emerald ores
and<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.599> goes<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.870> forever<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.560> think<00:02:51.160> we

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
and it goes on forever and I think we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.860 
and it goes on forever and I think we
specified<00:02:51.670> six<00:02:51.940> blocks<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.540> let's<00:02:52.720> go<00:02:52.840> ahead

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
specified six blocks so let's go ahead

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.289 
specified six blocks so let's go ahead
and<00:02:53.019> check<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.379> we<00:02:53.590> have<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.980> two<00:02:54.760> three

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
and check that we have one two three

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.229 
and check that we have one two three
four<00:02:55.720> five<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.530> then<00:02:57.160> six<00:02:57.489> right<00:02:57.670> here<00:02:57.700> so

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
four five and then six right here so

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.180 
four five and then six right here so
yeah<00:02:58.569> that's<00:02:58.750> really<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.290> cool<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.980> if<00:03:00.099> you

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
yeah that's really really cool so if you

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.250 
yeah that's really really cool so if you
guys<00:03:00.310> specified<00:03:00.849> say<00:03:01.090> 50<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.599> would<00:03:01.720> have<00:03:01.870> 50

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
guys specified say 50 you would have 50

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.589 
guys specified say 50 you would have 50
emerald<00:03:02.680> or<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:03.730> know<00:03:03.819> blocks<00:03:04.120> going<00:03:04.390> all<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
emerald or you know blocks going all the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.520 
emerald or you know blocks going all the
way<00:03:04.660> up<00:03:04.780> here<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.260> would<00:03:05.349> start

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
way up here then it would start

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.319 
way up here then it would start
automatically<00:03:06.010> generating<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.239> just

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
automatically generating so it's just

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.640 
automatically generating so it's just
how<00:03:07.510> deep<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.930> want<00:03:07.959> your<00:03:08.200> world<00:03:08.379> to<00:03:08.530> be

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
how deep you want your world to be

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.199 
how deep you want your world to be
essentially<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.030> because

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
essentially but I just do this because

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.630 
essentially but I just do this because
it<00:03:10.390> does<00:03:10.569> make<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.739> little<00:03:11.769> bit<00:03:12.099> easier<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
it does make it a little bit easier on

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.039 
it does make it a little bit easier on
your<00:03:12.819> minecraft<00:03:13.000> world<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.780> doesn't<00:03:13.959> have

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
your minecraft world so it doesn't have

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.410 
your minecraft world so it doesn't have
to<00:03:14.109> generate<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.590> much<00:03:14.799> or<00:03:15.040> now<00:03:15.849> what's<00:03:16.209> really

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
to generate as much or now what's really

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.750 
to generate as much or now what's really
really<00:03:16.780> weird<00:03:16.989> i<00:03:17.170> think<00:03:17.500> i<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.829> not<00:03:18.280> disable<00:03:18.549> it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
really weird i think i do not disable it

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.009 
really weird i think i do not disable it
here<00:03:18.940> as<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.120> guys<00:03:19.269> can<00:03:19.389> tell<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.750> kind<00:03:19.989> of

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
here as you guys can tell it kind of

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.770 
here as you guys can tell it kind of
glitches<00:03:20.290> out<00:03:20.530> with<00:03:20.769> npc<00:03:21.250> villages<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.910> what

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
glitches out with npc villages and what

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.470 
glitches out with npc villages and what
I<00:03:22.810> decide<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.280> situation<00:03:24.669> this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
I decide to do in that situation this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.729 
I decide to do in that situation this
would<00:03:25.630> actually<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.959> kind<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.380> cool<00:03:26.560> little

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739
