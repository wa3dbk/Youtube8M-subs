times as you want chain them together so
you<00:01:36.390> start<00:01:36.930> off<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.049> number<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.860> which<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you start off with number one which is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
you start off with number one which is
like<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> time<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like this and then by the time you

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.130 
like this and then by the time you
finish<00:01:40.740> alright<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.450> number

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
finish alright which is like this number

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870 
finish alright which is like this number
four<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.680> should<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:44.280> able<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.700> from

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
four you should be able to go from

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.389 
four you should be able to go from
number<00:01:45.119> four<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.720> number<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.130> very

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
number four to number one and it's very

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.340 
number four to number one and it's very
important<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.149> connect<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
important that you connect all of the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
important that you connect all of the
movements<00:01:49.799> together<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.430> number<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
movements together so number one and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
movements together so number one and
then<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> continued<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.829> see<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> motion

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
then it continued you see the motion

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.270 
then it continued you see the motion
continues<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> leads<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.920> number

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
continues on and then it leads to number

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850 
continues on and then it leads to number
two<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.240> takes<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.990> number<00:01:58.350> three

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
two which then takes you to number three

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.910 
two which then takes you to number three
and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> motion<00:02:00.180> still<00:02:00.420> continues<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and then the motion still continues for

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
and then the motion still continues for
number<00:02:02.189> four<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.119> goes<00:02:03.240> back<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
number four and then it goes back to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.200 
number four and then it goes back to
number<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.680> continues<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
number one and it continues on so it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
number one and it continues on so it's
very<00:02:06.390> important<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> chain<00:02:07.409> everything

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
very important to chain everything

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.440 
very important to chain everything
together<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.910> make<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
together to make it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:40.180 
together to make it
completely<00:02:09.690> fluid<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.649> smooth

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.760 

one<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.180> reasons<00:02:41.570> why<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.260> such<00:02:42.740> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
one of the reasons why this is such a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860 
one of the reasons why this is such a
good<00:02:43.160> forum<00:02:43.520> for<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.850> guys<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.150> practice<00:02:44.660> is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
good forum for you guys to practice is

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.290 
good forum for you guys to practice is
because<00:02:45.830> you're<00:02:46.040> chaining<00:02:46.460> everything

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
because you're chaining everything

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.920 
because you're chaining everything
together

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
together

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.740 
together
it<00:02:48.110> forces<00:02:48.680> everything<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.460> be<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:50.210> together

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
it forces everything to be more together

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.330 
it forces everything to be more together
so<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.170> forces<00:02:51.530> everything<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> be<00:02:52.160> more

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
so it forces everything to be more

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.790 
so it forces everything to be more
compact<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.090> staying<00:02:53.690> within<00:02:53.990> this<00:02:54.350> frame

there is a right time for that I am a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.370 
there is a right time for that I am a
firm<00:03:17.030> believer<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.810> that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
firm believer in that

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.610 
firm believer in that
but<00:03:19.220> most<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.210> time<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.780> mean<00:03:21.110> if<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.440> could

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
but most of the time I mean if you could

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.710 
but most of the time I mean if you could
just<00:03:21.860> parry<00:03:22.400> or<00:03:22.520> defend<00:03:23.060> against<00:03:23.330> an<00:03:23.420> attack

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
or even attack and all it takes is this

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.970 
or even attack and all it takes is this
you'd<00:03:26.180> rather<00:03:26.480> do<00:03:26.780> that<00:03:26.960> and<00:03:27.260> have<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.560> do<00:03:27.740> this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
you'd rather do that and have to do this

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.580 
you'd rather do that and have to do this
every<00:03:28.580> time<00:03:28.610> okay<00:03:29.450> that's<00:03:30.020> going<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.260> put<00:03:30.470> you

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
off balance that's going to create

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.430 
off balance that's going to create
openings<00:03:32.450> it's<00:03:32.930> going<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.200> make<00:03:33.320> you

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
openings it's going to make you

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
put everything connected and keep it

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.140 
put everything connected and keep it
tight<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.500> together<00:03:39.920> much<00:03:40.460> more<00:03:40.490> efficient

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
tight and together much more efficient

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.330 
tight and together much more efficient
less<00:03:41.660> openings<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.770> still<00:03:43.070> be<00:03:43.250> in

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
less openings and you still be in

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.860 
less openings and you still be in
balance

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.250 

now<00:03:49.590> I've<00:03:49.920> given<00:03:50.190> many<00:03:50.730> reasons<00:03:51.270> why<00:03:51.540> twirling

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
now I've given many reasons why twirling

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.250 
now I've given many reasons why twirling
is<00:03:52.470> good<00:03:52.980> there's<00:03:53.340> much<00:03:53.670> more<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.170> a

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
is good there's much more right and a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.990 
is good there's much more right and a
lot<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.800> you<00:03:55.830> want<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.280> discover<00:03:56.700> for

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
lot of it you want to discover for

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.690 
lot of it you want to discover for
yourself<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.810> here's<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.440> more<00:03:58.620> reason<00:03:58.860> okay

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
yourself but here's one more reason okay

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550 
yourself but here's one more reason okay
so<00:03:59.819> when<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.090> come<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.720> cut<00:04:01.020> like<00:04:01.230> this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
so when I come in with a cut like this

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.479 
so when I come in with a cut like this
okay<00:04:02.239> let's<00:04:03.239> think<00:04:03.360> about<00:04:03.630> where<00:04:04.110> exactly<00:04:04.560> is

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
okay let's think about where exactly is

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.000 
okay let's think about where exactly is
the<00:04:05.880> actual<00:04:06.330> major<00:04:06.690> part<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.410> cut<00:04:07.620> taking

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the actual major part of the cut taking

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.120 
the actual major part of the cut taking
place<00:04:08.250> not<00:04:08.970> here<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.080> start<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.980> even

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
place not here this is to start and even

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.800 
place not here this is to start and even
right<00:04:11.489> here<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.450> where<00:04:12.690> it's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
right here this is right where it's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.110 
right here this is right where it's
starting<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.349> go<00:04:13.560> into<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.010> cut<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.550> not

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
starting to go into the cut so not

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.720 
starting to go into the cut so not
really<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.690> still<00:04:15.930> premature<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:17.489> is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
really this is still premature this is

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.210 
really this is still premature this is
the<00:04:17.910> area<00:04:18.389> where<00:04:19.169> I'm<00:04:19.440> actually<00:04:19.620> doing<00:04:20.010> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
the area where I'm actually doing the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.920 
the area where I'm actually doing the
cut<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.700> then<00:04:20.910> back<00:04:21.150> here<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
cut and then back here this is the

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.750 
cut and then back here this is the
follow<00:04:22.169> through<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.800> that's<00:04:23.070> not<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:23.430> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
follow through so that's not really it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.510 
follow through so that's not really it
although<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.810> can<00:04:25.110> cut<00:04:25.470> here<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.280> can

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
although you can cut here and you can

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520 
although you can cut here and you can
cut<00:04:26.790> over<00:04:27.389> here<00:04:27.660> with<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.900> follow<00:04:28.200> through

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
cut over here with a follow through

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.260 
cut over here with a follow through
it<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.830> possible<00:04:29.400> especially<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.940> they<00:04:30.060> stick

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
it is possible especially if they stick

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.750 
it is possible especially if they stick
their<00:04:30.419> hand<00:04:30.630> out<00:04:30.780> or<00:04:30.960> something<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.160> but

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
their hand out or something you can but

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.210 
their hand out or something you can but
the<00:04:32.910> main<00:04:33.180> area<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.690> right<00:04:34.260> here<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.070> it's

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
the main area is right here and it's

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.200 
the main area is right here and it's
it's<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.729> relatively<00:04:36.270> small<00:04:36.840> area<00:04:37.250> okay<00:04:38.250> now<00:04:38.850> if

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
it's a relatively small area okay now if

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.810 
it's a relatively small area okay now if
you<00:04:39.479> add<00:04:39.750> a<00:04:40.139> circle<00:04:40.800> there<00:04:41.010> what<00:04:41.370> you're<00:04:41.520> doing

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
you add a circle there what you're doing

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.040 
you add a circle there what you're doing
is<00:04:42.000> right<00:04:43.340> be<00:04:44.340> right<00:04:44.820> after<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.660> right

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
is right be right after this and right

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.080 
is right be right after this and right
before<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.650> follow<00:04:46.919> through<00:04:47.040> that's<00:04:47.639> where

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
before the follow through that's where

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.659 
before the follow through that's where
the<00:04:48.240> circle<00:04:48.630> takes<00:04:48.840> place<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:49.860> right<00:04:50.280> in<00:04:50.550> that

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the circle takes place so right in that

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.330 
the circle takes place so right in that
small<00:04:51.090> area<00:04:51.120> you're<00:04:51.960> making<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.560> circle<00:04:53.070> okay

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
small area you're making a circle okay

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.460 
small area you're making a circle okay
with<00:04:53.760> de<00:04:53.880> Toro<00:04:54.210> you're<00:04:54.510> making<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.870> circle<00:04:55.289> and

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
with de Toro you're making a circle and

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.469 
with de Toro you're making a circle and
so<00:04:56.070> you're<00:04:56.250> carving<00:04:56.580> there<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.300> you're

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
so you're carving there so you're

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.360 
so you're carving there so you're
actually<00:04:57.630> increasing<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.620> distance<00:04:58.950> of

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
actually increasing the distance of

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:08.750 
actually increasing the distance of
damage<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.539> you're<00:05:00.750> doing

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.820
