00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 yahoo has the assets it is the case of paul 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.040
 hawken point fr today we will speak 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.960
 of a hull that does not cock all that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.330
 is simpler since it is the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.330
 iphone 6 shell more official 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.619
 this is for the little moments 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.660
 as sakho at the corner fr I think 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.349
 apple buddies will send this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.270
 small shell for iphone 6 more at the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.610
 hand since the iphone 6 comes out only 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.350
 normally friday the iphone 6 + 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.320
 should maybe arrive before but we 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.850
 cross fingers and belaya iphone case 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.070
 6 chip is already here what will we 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.540
 to get an idea of ​​the size 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.739
 of the best of yes because basically 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.600
 the agreement passed in motion 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.010
 we will say it clearly when 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 leather since I have not done taking 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.710
 like leather why have you taken a shell 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.190
 in leather so I 'm a big fan of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.540
 quads loc 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.400
 because what of the ocs did not announce 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.780
 of cases for iphone 6 lower they 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.699
 have announced but arriving in a few 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 months so in an upcoming video I 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.519
 will show you how to transform 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.440
 this small bank that still something 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.110
 the ocs simply level size it 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.960
 looks like what we open this draw 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.659
 easily topped canjet the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 thing we announce that like this and so 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.049
 but it's all stupid it 's still a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.220
 hull one that tells you how he 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.900
 must put the iphone then we tell you 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.760
 well again you would be deeply 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.320
 cities that I need I think you have 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.390
 a focus that needs to be 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.560
 to have a very low and high of 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:33.440
 the iphone then the bug iphone iphone 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.930
 I'm here again live magic so the hull 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.610
 for iphone 6 plus is here in terms of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.410
 size it gives what I have no good 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.480
 read chan so it's not really 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.950
 war between is native to the ear that 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.560
 is still a kind of big thing 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.870
 but it's not shocking we come to a 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.550
 height the water through the microphone during and 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.120
 more or less of a level of can not 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.350
 more still 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.510
 I was going to say more or less at the level of 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.420
 the mouth behind but that's it 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.800
 this when we hold something tomorrow if 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.140
 we never want to hold the hull until tomorrow 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.440
 hop for it is there that we here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.240
 do a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.260
 a seizure trick that's still not 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 too stupid hop there and then and that's it 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.090
 a hand it's cool the button on off is 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.890
 find here naturally under the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.300
 forgiveness finger i'm sorry china 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.610
 under the pretty cool name the buttons of 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.040
 volume are here it's still pretty 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.330
 cool it's not that big that I would go 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.740
 even to say that it's not far 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.390
 to be reached by fact six omlt one 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.950
 iphone 5 enough in it looks like 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.510
 what 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.950
 it's tiny iphone 5 is there and he 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.420
 there's plenty of edge around so I repeat 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 it's a case for iphone 6 plus 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.060
 in thick ben it's more or less 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 the same 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 it's the same hand on the near as 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.700
 the iphone finally there is difference cds 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 that is played at mm clearly we are 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.330
 fuck and then and so here it is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 quite firm by cons baye that makes 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.300
 still much bigger like you 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.710
 see it is what leather and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.750
 better quality compared to leathers 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.610
 of the shell for iphone 5 years since 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.140
 I have both here in black leather 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.970
 yes definitely 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.320
 it's leather is different I do not know 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.750
 if the best quality but in any case 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.240
 the leather is clearly different we are 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.490
 more on the ipad leather than on the 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.930
 Leather ae though the iphone that 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.870
 was softer did a little more leather 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.940
 Golf gosh that there is 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.650
 really more and that it did not smell 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 not already some lakes calm and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.459
 beginning it was not and and in terms of 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.750
 touch it's different it's not the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.280
 same leather for sure I do not know 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.600
 few hours is if someone has 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.209
 info he will put it in the comments 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.920
 on the campo fr and then and then 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.600

 will even take you an iphone 6 case 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.840
 more but mostly to realize 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.120
 the size of the device in reality and 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.530
