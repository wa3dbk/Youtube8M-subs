was<00:02:58.760> shocked<00:02:59.450> by<00:02:59.810> how<00:02:59.959> well<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.850> covered

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
was shocked by how well you it covered

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.059 
was shocked by how well you it covered
in<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.450> first<00:03:02.690> one<00:03:02.930> for<00:03:03.140> being<00:03:03.350> such<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.650> high

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
in the first one for being such a high

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.449 
in the first one for being such a high
density<00:03:04.540> glitter<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.680> look<00:03:06.830> how<00:03:06.980> slightly

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
density glitter but look how slightly

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.500 
density glitter but look how slightly
this<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.940> right<00:03:08.180> now<00:03:08.360> I'm<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.560> color<00:03:09.890> I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
this is right now I'm just one color I

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.630 
this is right now I'm just one color I
like<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> let<00:03:11.870> my<00:03:12.140> nails<00:03:12.560> dry<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> little<00:03:13.280> more

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
like to let my nails dry a little more

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.880 
like to let my nails dry a little more
than<00:03:13.820> usual<00:03:14.060> when<00:03:14.540> doing<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.990> pixie<00:03:15.350> finishes

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
than usual when doing the pixie finishes

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.780 
than usual when doing the pixie finishes
just<00:03:16.540> because<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.870> feel<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.230> if<00:03:18.770> you'd<00:03:19.430> let<00:03:19.670> it

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
just because I feel like if you'd let it

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.059 
just because I feel like if you'd let it
dry<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> little<00:03:20.209> more<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.690> between<00:03:20.870> layers<00:03:21.350> you

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
dry a little more in between layers you

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.340 
dry a little more in between layers you
really<00:03:22.340> get<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.520> better<00:03:22.730> finish<00:03:23.690> with<00:03:24.020> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
really get a better finish with the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.680 
really get a better finish with the
pixie<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.070> having<00:03:25.400> textured<00:03:26.030> nails<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:29.570> now

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
pixie and having textured nails so now

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.640 
pixie and having textured nails so now
I'm<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:29.989> going<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.230> apply<00:03:30.530> another<00:03:30.800> layer

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.890 

and<00:03:36.650> once<00:03:37.459> again<00:03:37.670> you<00:03:37.940> really<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.390> not<00:03:38.540> need<00:03:38.750> to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and once again you really do not need to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.600 
and once again you really do not need to
have<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.200> much<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.530> your<00:03:39.680> brush<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:40.370> is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
have that much on your brush this is

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.060 
have that much on your brush this is
just<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.360> best<00:03:41.720> formula<00:03:42.350> I've<00:03:42.470> ever<00:03:42.650> worked

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
just the best formula I've ever worked

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.420 
just the best formula I've ever worked
with

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
with

00:03:43.430 --> 00:04:02.660 
with
for<00:03:43.700> such<00:03:44.110> gorgeous<00:03:45.110> glitters

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.740 

and<00:04:03.670> there<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.630> second<00:04:05.050> complete<00:04:05.530> lair

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
and there is the second complete lair

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.130 
and there is the second complete lair
can<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.930> just<00:04:08.140> see<00:04:08.500> all<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:09.250> glitter<00:04:10.140> and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
can you just see all this glitter and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.550 
can you just see all this glitter and
how<00:04:11.650> perfect<00:04:12.460> you<00:04:12.700> really<00:04:13.090> only<00:04:13.270> need<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.600> cup

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
how perfect you really only need to cup

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.780 
how perfect you really only need to cup
two<00:04:15.160> coats<00:04:15.730> you<00:04:16.660> don't<00:04:16.870> see<00:04:17.170> the<00:04:17.410> natural<00:04:17.980> nail

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
two coats you don't see the natural nail

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:27.710 
two coats you don't see the natural nail
line<00:04:19.060> at<00:04:19.299> all<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:21.580> just<00:04:21.840> shines<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.650> much

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.780 

so<00:04:28.720> once<00:04:29.170> it<00:04:29.350> dries<00:04:29.620> more<00:04:30.100> you'll<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so once it dries more you'll have the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.540 
so once it dries more you'll have the
pixie<00:04:31.600> dust<00:04:31.840> finish<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.830> completely<00:04:36.250> dry

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
pixie dust finish it is completely dry

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.370 
pixie dust finish it is completely dry
now<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.120> it<00:04:37.240> has<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:38.290> texture<00:04:38.890> effect<00:04:39.580> and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
now so it has the texture effect and

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.260 
now so it has the texture effect and
surprisingly<00:04:41.380> even<00:04:41.860> though<00:04:42.160> how<00:04:42.460> chunky<00:04:42.790> some

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
surprisingly even though how chunky some

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.420 
surprisingly even though how chunky some
of<00:04:43.360> these<00:04:43.480> glitters<00:04:43.990> are<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:45.130> would<00:04:45.250> think

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
of these glitters are you would think

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.810 
of these glitters are you would think
the<00:04:45.670> texture<00:04:46.090> was<00:04:46.600> more<00:04:47.050> rough<00:04:47.520> but<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.700> is

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
the texture was more rough but it is

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.710 
the texture was more rough but it is
very<00:04:49.270> similar<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.650> regular<00:04:50.830> pixie<00:04:51.490> dust

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
very similar to the regular pixie dust

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.470 
very similar to the regular pixie dust
it's<00:04:52.720> just<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.670> slightest<00:04:54.670> amount<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.330> get

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
it's just the slightest amount to get

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.650 
it's just the slightest amount to get
rid<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:55.900> extra<00:04:56.290> interest<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.570> give<00:04:58.570> you

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
rid of that extra interest and give you

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.520 
rid of that extra interest and give you
the<00:04:58.810> texture<00:04:59.230> effect<00:05:00.420> overall<00:05:01.420> I<00:05:02.020> obviously

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
the texture effect overall I obviously

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.930 
the texture effect overall I obviously
love<00:05:03.220> this<00:05:03.640> color<00:05:03.940> Cosmo<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:05.130> am<00:05:06.130> going<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.790> be

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
probably really interested in this these

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.350 
probably really interested in this these
magical<00:05:23.140> pixie<00:05:23.350> dust<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.100> if<00:05:25.030> you<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.270> the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
magical pixie dust and if you have the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.850 
magical pixie dust and if you have the
same<00:05:25.540> concerns<00:05:25.780> about<00:05:26.200> me<00:05:26.530> having<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:28.030> be<00:05:28.300> hard

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
same concerns about me having it be hard

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.860 
same concerns about me having it be hard
application<00:05:29.860> because<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.370> chunkiness

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
application because of the chunkiness

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.280 
application because of the chunkiness
I'm<00:05:31.870> pleased<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:33.010> tell<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.310> I<00:05:33.930> did<00:05:34.930> not<00:05:35.050> have

any problems and you probably could tell

any problems and you probably could tell
from<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.230> but<00:05:39.000> soya<00:05:40.000> just<00:05:40.419> has<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.990> best

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200

I really highly suggest getting these
