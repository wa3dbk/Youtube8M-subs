00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
we've got to come out and beat those

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
we've got to come out and beat those
teams<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.590> come<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> play<00:00:50.280> ten<00:00:50.489> behind<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
teams that come and play ten behind the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.069 
teams that come and play ten behind the
ball<00:00:50.940> against<00:00:51.270> us<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.600> wasn't<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.020> was

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
ball against us and that wasn't what was

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
ball against us and that wasn't what was
happening<00:00:52.379> today<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.129> looked<00:00:53.280> incredibly

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
happening today but we looked incredibly

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.819 
happening today but we looked incredibly
organized<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.420> MoPO<00:00:54.719> got<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.170> but

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
organized i think MoPO got it right but

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
organized i think MoPO got it right but
again<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.030> come<00:00:57.210> away<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.510> Old<00:00:57.750> Trafford

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
with nothing we haven't won here in a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.459 
with nothing we haven't won here in a
couple<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> years<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:01.230> seem

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
couple of years and we just don't seem

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
couple of years and we just don't seem
to<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> pace<00:01:01.980> at<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> moment<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> hit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to have the pace at the moment to hit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.250 
to have the pace at the moment to hit
teams<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> counter-attack<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.080> what

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
teams on the counter-attack that's what

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
teams on the counter-attack that's what
I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:05.250> terms<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> performances<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
I think in terms of performances like I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.570 
I think in terms of performances like I
said<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.110> Walker<00:01:07.350> did<00:01:07.590> well<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.490> well

the<00:01:16.740> viral<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> he<00:01:17.580> was<00:01:17.670> trying<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> load<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> lot

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the viral is he was trying to load a lot

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.999 
the viral is he was trying to load a lot
of<00:01:18.810> long<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> sweeping<00:01:19.619> Crossfield

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of long kind of sweeping Crossfield

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
of long kind of sweeping Crossfield
balls<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:21.210> weren't<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.570> coming<00:01:21.810> off

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
balls and they weren't really coming off

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.850 
balls and they weren't really coming off
and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.799> he

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and I think that's more because he

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.380 
and I think that's more because he
wasn't<00:01:23.040> getting<00:01:23.369> enough<00:01:23.460> coming<00:01:24.210> from

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
wasn't getting enough coming from

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
wasn't getting enough coming from
defensive<00:01:24.840> midfield<00:01:25.140> bentaleb<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.979> looked

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
defensive midfield bentaleb he looked

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
defensive midfield bentaleb he looked
tired<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:27.000> played<00:01:27.210> both<00:01:27.420> those<00:01:27.600> games<00:01:27.780> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
tired he played both those games in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
tired he played both those games in
pre-season<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> other<00:01:28.710> day<00:01:29.009> against<00:01:29.549> Munich

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pre-season the other day against Munich

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
pre-season the other day against Munich
and<00:01:30.420> real<00:01:30.570> madrid<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.590> looked<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and real madrid and it looked like a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
and real madrid and it looked like a
mistake<00:01:32.280> dire<00:01:32.520> isn't<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> central<00:01:33.329> midfielder

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
mistake dire isn't a central midfielder

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
mistake dire isn't a central midfielder
I<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.140> think<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:34.979> weren't<00:01:35.220> coming<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I don't think so they weren't coming to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.859 
I don't think so they weren't coming to
get<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> ball<00:01:35.880> enough<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.270> alder<00:01:36.509> viral<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
get the ball enough of alder viral so

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
get the ball enough of alder viral so
that<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> problem<00:01:37.500> Chadli<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.549> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that was a problem Chadli I like I think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.830 
that was a problem Chadli I like I think
Chadli<00:01:39.000> might<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> good<00:01:39.659> season
