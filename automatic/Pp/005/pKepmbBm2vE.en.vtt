 James is the fool that come my cool 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.420
 video camera 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.969
 now I can make super videos 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 productions in high definition I can turn 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.270
 a filmmaker and peraÃ­ that government is this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.000
 let me see here is the craze link 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.220
 newlink 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.189
 let's see what it is that makes a good is light 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 fits well in hand here it says here that is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 full hd 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 Come on record, let me just get the card. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.309
 memory and is each card does not come 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 together 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.280
 there is in our display here that can not really 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.809
 see right seems a little weak just has 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.750
 digital zoom 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.789
 those buttons here are kind of hard 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.469
 she takes photos too I'm going to take some 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.469
 I'll see you later, how you got 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.780
 But what is this fruit of the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.299
 granulated and that was hd and that takes me 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.210
 only 15 frames per second 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.460
 the zoom is bad the sound also does not give 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.690
 To hear what people are talking about. 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.970
 and the photos 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.610
 Look at the white bursting noise 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.680
 in the image in the cobom this here is not a 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.729
 battery is running out 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.770
 each one carries what he does not have 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.240
 has solar charger to charge sv 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.350
 still have to have a computer for 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.570
 near and now I did not like this camera 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.580
 Will I throw money away? 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 it's not possible this has to have 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.030
 some utility 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.660
 but not even for the weight of paper she serves
