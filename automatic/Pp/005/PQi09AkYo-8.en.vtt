00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.790
 there are many questions from ours 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 watch for the upcoming windows 10 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.810
 upgrade that is well known for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.119
 windows 7 and windows 8 users 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 be free and even windows 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 insider of the eponymous beta-test 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 programs may appear after 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 windows 10 your free versions 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 continue to use and test if synonymous with 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 a few technical issues like 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.719
 Constant beta updates and the microsoft 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 your usage data may be used in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.290
 age of facebook where we are anyway 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870
 all inhibitions drop and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.450
 reveal the most intimate things because I have none 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.730
 inappropriate condition many but 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 Worrying about whether you are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.980
 again after the free upgrade 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 back if you can windows 10 easy 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.050
 stupid or not clever 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.789
 works or they complain that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.879
 your free upgrade to the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.589
 existing pc is now tied too 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.720
 today that's a new one 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.060
 windows pc just a license for just 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 this device contains is the times over 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.780
 There is also no free new one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.890
 version 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 that's why these so-called oem 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.930
 Licenses are also much cheaper than that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.909
 full version in loading the operating system 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.430
 apple ios apps are there for everyone 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.110
 for free one puts with the purchase one 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 new apple computers too neat 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.590
 money on the table 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.869
 In addition, apple alone earns with the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 hardware sale so much money then 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.729
 its high margins from those others 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 manufacturers can only dream 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.100
 that's why apple can loose that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.439
 operating system for its own 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.880
 give away a computer 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.640
 I therefore find the free windows 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 10 upgrade really good too because 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.380
 microsoft admits that windows 8 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.810
 was not so great and the same 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.470
 a version number skips my 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.630
 Conclusion 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
 You do not look at a gift horse 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.290
 in the mouth and my advice to all 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.060
 undecided you wait 364 days and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 then install it for free 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 windows 10 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.409
 because by that time, surely, everyone 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.409
 teething problems are eliminated
