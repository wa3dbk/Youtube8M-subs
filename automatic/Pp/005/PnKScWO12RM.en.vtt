listened to
at<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:14.970> point<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.509> start<00:01:16.020> listening<00:01:16.170> again<00:01:16.500> I

at which point I start listening again I

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.560 
at which point I start listening again I
find<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.580> difficult<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.240> listen<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
find it really difficult to listen to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
find it really difficult to listen to
the<00:01:18.780> boys<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.350> they're<00:01:19.500> talking<00:01:19.830> about

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

something<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> they're<00:01:20.580> interested<00:01:20.940> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
something that they're interested in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090 
something that they're interested in
because<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.259> fact<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.560> they're<00:01:22.770> children

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
because the fact that they're children

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.680 
because the fact that they're children
means<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> they're<00:01:23.759> interested<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.479> things

are getting the lines for rules are
getting<00:03:16.300> blurred<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.530> think<00:03:17.740> yeah<00:03:18.430> they

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
getting blurred so I think yeah they

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.580 
getting blurred so I think yeah they
need<00:03:19.060> boundaries<00:03:19.390> that<00:03:19.720> if<00:03:20.110> they<00:03:20.320> don't<00:03:20.470> have

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
need boundaries that if they don't have

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.320 
need boundaries that if they don't have
a<00:03:20.620> strict<00:03:21.010> schedule<00:03:21.370> then<00:03:21.790> how<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.030> they

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
a strict schedule then how will they

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.300 
a strict schedule then how will they
learn<00:03:22.570> what<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:22.960> like<00:03:23.140> later<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.650> they<00:03:24.070> don't

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
learn what it's like later on they don't

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.550 
learn what it's like later on they don't

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
and of course ultimately we're their

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.800 
and of course ultimately we're their
parents<00:04:05.950> we<00:04:06.460> have<00:04:06.490> to<00:04:06.700> keep<00:04:06.940> them<00:04:07.120> safe<00:04:07.360> so

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
parents we have to keep them safe so

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
parents we have to keep them safe so
it's<00:04:08.080> it's<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.410> tussle<00:04:09.190> isn't<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.790> it's<00:04:09.910> what

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
it's it's that tussle isn't it it's what

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.850 
it's it's that tussle isn't it it's what
being<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.330> parent<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.720> such<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> tough<00:04:11.140> job<00:04:11.380> well

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
being a parent is such a tough job well

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.800 
being a parent is such a tough job well
I<00:04:11.890> think<00:04:12.010> one<00:04:12.490> of<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.760> things<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:13.630> can

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
I think one of the things that we can

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.600 
I think one of the things that we can
help<00:04:13.840> our<00:04:14.170> children<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.370> whole

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
help our children with is this whole

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.250 
help our children with is this whole
business<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:16.090> helping<00:04:16.720> them<00:04:16.960> move<00:04:17.080> to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
business of helping them move to

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.470 
business of helping them move to
independence<00:04:17.980> we<00:04:18.730> can<00:04:18.880> help<00:04:19.090> them<00:04:19.239> by

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
independence we can help them by

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.180 
independence we can help them by
equipping<00:04:20.080> them<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.290> make<00:04:20.500> little<00:04:20.950> choices

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
equipping them to make little choices

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.800 
equipping them to make little choices
giving<00:04:21.640> them<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.880> opportunity<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.600> make

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
giving them the opportunity to make

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.200 
giving them the opportunity to make
little<00:04:23.560> choices<00:04:23.980> about<00:04:24.160> things<00:04:25.120> that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
little choices about things that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.820 
little choices about things that
actually<00:04:25.660> aren't<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.050> important<00:04:26.650> when

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
actually aren't that important when

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.470 
actually aren't that important when
they're<00:04:26.980> little<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.520> are<00:04:27.910> they<00:04:28.090> going<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.360> wear

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
they're little so are they going to wear

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.830 
they're little so are they going to wear
red<00:04:29.290> socks<00:04:29.560> or<00:04:29.710> blue<00:04:29.890> socks<00:04:30.160> today<00:04:30.370> or<00:04:30.840> they're

red socks or blue socks today or they're

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.120 
red socks or blue socks today or they're
packed<00:04:32.080> lunch<00:04:32.290> you<00:04:32.500> know<00:04:32.530> do<00:04:32.830> they<00:04:32.950> want

whatever<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.250> what<00:04:36.760> color<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.030> they

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
whatever it is and what color do they

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.060 
whatever it is and what color do they
want<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> pick<00:04:37.450> their<00:04:37.600> room<00:04:37.870> what<00:04:38.680> clothes<00:04:38.890> do

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
they want to wear and as we do that I

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.740 
they want to wear and as we do that I
think<00:04:41.830> we're<00:04:42.070> helping<00:04:42.490> them<00:04:42.700> make<00:04:43.570> those

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
think we're helping them make those

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.150 
think we're helping them make those
choices<00:04:43.990> about<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.470> little<00:04:44.770> things<00:04:44.980> that

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
choices about the little things that

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.950 
choices about the little things that
then<00:04:45.460> equips<00:04:46.060> them<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.510> builds<00:04:46.750> trust

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
then equips them and builds trust

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.110 
then equips them and builds trust
actually<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.650> helps<00:04:47.890> them<00:04:48.070> make<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
actually and helps them make the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.850 
actually and helps them make the
decisions<00:04:49.840> about<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.110> more<00:04:50.440> important

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
decisions about the more important

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.910 
decisions about the more important
things<00:04:51.100> as<00:04:51.370> they<00:04:51.970> grow<00:04:52.240> up<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:53.590> guess

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
things as they grow up and I guess

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.810 
things as they grow up and I guess
that's<00:04:54.070> what<00:04:54.250> we've<00:04:54.370> been<00:04:54.400> talking<00:04:54.610> about

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
that's what we've been talking about

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.390 
that's what we've been talking about
really<00:04:55.210> equipping<00:04:56.020> our<00:04:56.170> children<00:04:56.710> for

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
really equipping our children for

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.880 
really equipping our children for
independence<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:58.540> out<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:59.020> all<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.320> firm

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
independence and so out of all that firm

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.010 
independence and so out of all that firm
what<00:05:00.160> would<00:05:00.310> be<00:05:00.460> your<00:05:00.640> top<00:05:01.060> tip<00:05:01.480> that<00:05:01.870> you'd

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
what would be your top tip that you'd

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.510 
what would be your top tip that you'd
want<00:05:02.230> do<00:05:02.350> there's<00:05:02.530> one<00:05:02.710> thing<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.340> could

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
want do there's one thing that you could

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.450 
want do there's one thing that you could
say<00:05:03.669> to<00:05:03.700> parents<00:05:04.000> for

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
this is a constant pressure almost to

parent<00:07:08.400> it<00:07:09.180> can<00:07:09.360> be<00:07:09.479> very<00:07:09.689> rewarding<00:07:09.810> but

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:10.469 
parent it can be very rewarding but

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.800

what I think is best

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.029 
what I think is best
it<00:07:23.610> is<00:07:23.789> a<00:07:23.819> learning<00:07:24.120> process<00:07:24.680> things<00:07:25.680> change
