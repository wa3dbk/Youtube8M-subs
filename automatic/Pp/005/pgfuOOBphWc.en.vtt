last few days
just<00:00:23.340> thought<00:00:23.430> I'd<00:00:23.580> choose<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:24.119> early

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930

just thought I'd choose some early
gameplay<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:27.109> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> saved<00:00:28.920> game

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099

gameplay and this is from a saved game
that<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.550> already<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.060> cartridge

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570

some<00:01:37.600> more<00:01:37.720> gameplay<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:39.039> really<00:01:39.580> showing

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
some more gameplay it's really showing

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.359 
some more gameplay it's really showing
you<00:01:40.119> some<00:01:40.360> early<00:01:40.720> stuff<00:01:40.990> which<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.950> can<00:01:42.130> talk

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
you some early stuff which you can talk

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.399 
you some early stuff which you can talk
to<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.640> characters<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:46.509> is<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.659> map<00:01:47.080> on<00:01:47.289> the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
to the characters there is a map on the

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.260 
to the characters there is a map on the
bump<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:47.830> will<00:01:48.039> do<00:01:48.189> a<00:01:48.220> bit<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.399> double<00:01:48.970> screen

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
bump so I will do a bit of double screen

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.770 
bump so I will do a bit of double screen
gameplay<00:01:49.990> as<00:01:50.140> well

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.340 

and<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:57.640> pretty<00:01:57.909> fun<00:01:59.310> although<00:02:00.310> obviously

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and it's pretty fun although obviously

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.940 
and it's pretty fun although obviously
with<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.440> kind<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.770> language<00:02:03.780> differences<00:02:04.950> it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
with the kind of language differences it

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.469 
with the kind of language differences it
is<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.130> little<00:02:06.610> bit<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.940> understand<00:02:07.360> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
is a little bit to understand it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.719 
is a little bit to understand it
difficult<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.560> understand<00:02:08.920> exactly<00:02:09.039> what

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
difficult to understand exactly what

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.390 
difficult to understand exactly what
you're<00:02:09.910> doing<00:02:10.030> at<00:02:10.300> some<00:02:10.539> points

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
you're doing at some points

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.860 
you're doing at some points
I've<00:02:12.400> Legend<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:12.970> played<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.660> few

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
I've Legend and played it for a few

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.510 
I've Legend and played it for a few
minutes<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:14.530> I'm<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.390> know<00:02:16.540> give<00:02:16.810> me<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.959> few<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
minutes so I'm you know give me a few a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.000 
minutes so I'm you know give me a few a
little<00:02:18.520> time<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.540> should<00:02:19.900> hopefully<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
little time and I should hopefully get a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:31.229 
little time and I should hopefully get a
bit<00:02:21.190> further<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:22.920> okay<00:02:23.920> come<00:02:24.430> over<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
bit further with it okay come over and

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.120 
bit further with it okay come over and
go<00:02:31.480> ahead<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.140> gonna<00:02:32.380> try<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.709> head<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.100> my

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
boat I can find us we'll make this one

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.540 
boat I can find us we'll make this one
pretty<00:02:36.850> short<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.660> looks<00:02:38.080> like<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:38.560> headed

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550
