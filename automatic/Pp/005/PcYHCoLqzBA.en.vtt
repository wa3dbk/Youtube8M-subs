and for what I was doing at the time it
was<00:01:09.979> perfect<00:01:10.490> really<00:01:10.610> because<00:01:11.380> as<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.409> jazz

for something that was add the real
direct<00:01:20.030> sound<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.870> melodies<00:01:21.230> weren't

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
direct sound so the melodies weren't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.320 
direct sound so the melodies weren't
going<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.680> lost<00:01:21.920> behind<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.090> rhythm

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
going to get lost behind the rhythm

section<00:01:23.480> all<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:23.840> sort<00:01:24.050> of<00:01:24.080> stuff<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:24.320> also

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
section all that sort of stuff but also

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.950 
section all that sort of stuff but also
had<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.980> power<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.430> lay<00:01:26.210> down<00:01:26.240> good<00:01:26.600> rhythmic

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
had the power to lay down good rhythmic

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.160 
had the power to lay down good rhythmic
parts<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.490> lot<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.640> acoustics<00:01:29.210> especially

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
parts and a lot of acoustics especially

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.320 
parts and a lot of acoustics especially
they<00:01:30.290> don't<00:01:30.440> have<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.650> clarity<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> tone<00:01:31.490> when

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
they don't have the clarity a tone when

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.100 
they don't have the clarity a tone when
you're<00:01:32.450> laying<00:01:32.630> down<00:01:32.780> kind<00:01:33.140> of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
you're laying down kind of

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.040 
you're laying down kind of
kind<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:35.740> complex<00:01:36.040> like<00:01:36.750> contemporary<00:01:37.750> core

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
kind of complex like contemporary core

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.680 
kind of complex like contemporary core
voicings<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.620> really<00:01:38.890> needs<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.640> some<00:01:40.600> of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
voicings that really needs of some of

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.590 
voicings that really needs of some of
this<00:01:40.780> redesigned<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.470> kind<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.740> have<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> good

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this redesigned to kind of have a good

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
so each of the nodes kind of comes out

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.160 
so each of the nodes kind of comes out
you<00:01:45.670> know<00:01:46.920> find<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.980> sitar<00:01:48.310> specifically

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
whether it's down to the design or not I

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.010 
whether it's down to the design or not I
don't<00:01:51.820> know<00:01:51.970> anybody<00:01:52.240> actually<00:01:52.450> it's<00:01:52.900> a
