piece of the molding is missing here I'm

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.599 
piece of the molding is missing here I'm
not<00:00:28.199> sure<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:28.650> kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> molding

not sure what kind of what the molding
is<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.810> sand<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.529> bit<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> see

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is I'm gonna sand it a little bit to see

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.799

if I can determine and then I'll mill up

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.130 
if I can determine and then I'll mill up
a<00:00:33.870> piece<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> wood<00:00:34.460> cut<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.149> close<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
a piece of wood cut it just close to the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.160 
a piece of wood cut it just close to the
shape<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.980> glue<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.020> also

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
shape as I can glue it in and then also

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
shape as I can glue it in and then also

match<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> scrape<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
match I'm going to scrape this little to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
match I'm going to scrape this little to
try<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> determine<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> wood<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
try to determine what kind of wood this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.369 
try to determine what kind of wood this
is<00:00:52.100> it's<00:00:53.100> still<00:00:53.309> hard<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> determine<00:00:54.379> what

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
is it's still hard to determine what

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
is it's still hard to determine what
kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.610> gonna<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
kind of what it is I'm gonna put a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
kind of what it is I'm gonna put a
little<00:00:57.120> alcohol<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.840> it<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:01.710> looks

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
little alcohol on it it really looks

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
little alcohol on it it really looks
like<00:01:02.039> walnut<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.760> me<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.690> I'll<00:01:03.989> use

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
like walnut to me I think I'll use

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.200 
like walnut to me I think I'll use
walnut<00:01:04.680> maybe<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.430> find<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.850> lighter<00:01:06.689> piece

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
walnut maybe I can find a lighter piece

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.070 
walnut maybe I can find a lighter piece
looks<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.420> I'll<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.840> piece<00:01:11.000> about<00:01:12.080> maybe

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
looks like I'll need a piece about maybe

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.179 
looks like I'll need a piece about maybe
5/16<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:15.229> found<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> piece<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> scrap<00:01:16.920> wood

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
5/16 I found a piece of scrap wood

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
5/16 I found a piece of scrap wood
walnut<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:19.110> exact<00:01:19.439> thickness<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.040> want

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
walnut that's the exact thickness I want

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
walnut that's the exact thickness I want
and<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.939> some<00:01:21.150> white<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.540> walnut<00:01:21.960> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and it's got some white or walnut this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
and it's got some white or walnut this
end<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.280> I've<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> draw<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> curve

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
end so now I've got to draw the curve

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
end so now I've got to draw the curve
with<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> compass<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> looks<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
with a compass this looks like a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.420 
with a compass this looks like a
complete<00:01:29.909> radius<00:01:30.360> here

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
complete radius here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.120 
complete radius here
see<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> diameter<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.090> five<00:01:34.390> inches<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:36.040> I'll

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
see the diameter is five inches so I'll

00:01:36.130 --> 00:02:27.800 
see the diameter is five inches so I'll
set<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.369> compost<00:01:36.939> for<00:01:37.090> two<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.420> half

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.060 

the<00:02:28.810> next<00:02:29.050> step<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.350> let<00:02:29.500> me<00:02:29.530> clean<00:02:29.890> up<00:02:29.920> my

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
the next step is let me clean up my

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.000 
the next step is let me clean up my
edges<00:02:30.730> here<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:31.750> I'll<00:02:31.870> cut<00:02:32.110> out<00:02:32.140> my

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
edges here and then I'll cut out my

00:02:33.010 --> 00:03:07.420 
edges here and then I'll cut out my
patch

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.710 

okay

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
okay

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.870 
okay
it<00:03:09.720> seems<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.140> fit<00:03:10.320> pretty<00:03:10.560> well<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.520> before<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it seems to fit pretty well but before I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.140 
it seems to fit pretty well but before I
go<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.270> down<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:12.780> gonna<00:03:12.900> sand<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.730> edges<00:03:14.940> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
go it down I'm gonna sand the edges a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:24.960 
go it down I'm gonna sand the edges a
little<00:03:15.450> bit<00:03:15.570> here

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.759 

so<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.120> next<00:03:26.330> step<00:03:26.599> now<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:27.140> I'm<00:03:27.409> going<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> use

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
so the next step now is I'm going to use

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.520 
so the next step now is I'm going to use
my<00:03:27.950> compass<00:03:28.190> again<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:29.599> strike<00:03:29.900> these<00:03:30.140> lines

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
my compass again to strike these lines

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.430 
my compass again to strike these lines
there's<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.280> little<00:03:31.489> ledge<00:03:31.730> right<00:03:31.760> here<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.659> want

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
there's a little ledge right here I want

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.789 
there's a little ledge right here I want
to<00:03:33.590> cut<00:03:33.799> these<00:03:34.549> lines<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:36.080> then<00:03:36.260> form<00:03:36.590> that

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
to cut these lines and then form that

00:03:36.799 --> 00:04:42.020 
to cut these lines and then form that
top<00:03:37.099> bead

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.460 

I'm<00:04:43.030> gonna<00:04:43.180> make<00:04:43.390> sure<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.690> got<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.200> little

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
I'm gonna make sure I got this little

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.390 
I'm gonna make sure I got this little
ledge<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.850> along<00:04:46.120> here<00:04:47.190> exactly<00:04:48.190> where<00:04:48.370> I

want<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:52.630> I'm<00:04:52.720> gonna<00:04:52.810> work<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.230> this

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
want it now I'm gonna work on this

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:36.330 
want it now I'm gonna work on this
little<00:04:54.340> Cove<00:04:54.640> right<00:04:54.970> here<00:05:34.920> so<00:05:35.920> I've<00:05:36.040> got<00:05:36.220> it

close to the right color

close to the right color
I'll<00:07:00.889> let<00:07:01.069> the<00:07:01.159> stain<00:07:01.430> dry<00:07:01.669> I<00:07:02.059> give<00:07:02.960> it<00:07:03.080> one
