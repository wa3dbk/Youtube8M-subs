we're going to discuss this pesky link
here<00:04:00.670> at<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.880> bottom<00:04:01.060> which<00:04:01.510> unfortunately

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
here at the bottom which unfortunately

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.080 
here at the bottom which unfortunately
does<00:04:02.650> mean<00:04:02.890> that<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.160> jailbreak<00:04:03.520> is<00:04:03.610> patched

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
does mean that the jailbreak is patched

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.720 
does mean that the jailbreak is patched
so<00:04:04.750> one<00:04:04.989> disconcerting<00:04:05.830> note<00:04:06.070> as<00:04:06.280> far<00:04:06.580> as

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
so one disconcerting note as far as

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.250 
so one disconcerting note as far as
jailbreaking<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.480> concerned<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.110> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
jailbreaking is concerned is the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.680 
jailbreaking is concerned is the
