00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.139
 today we meet the trainer of and many fc groningen cambuur zenith 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.129
 Rick Mulder 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.349
 Mulder has been a trainer at FC Groningen for the two years, but he has before 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.410
 several others well trained i started at fc emmen 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.990
 five six years ago after that i have one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.500
 we have two weeks of training after which I did the regular internship 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.249
 and m from groningen stand they have done the wife of heerenveen for two years 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.909
 and i have been back here last year when it is a debate with 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.519
 second year 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.920
 he himself has only played football on an amateur basis 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 but to leave 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
 8 further is very special must say the number of harvests what is the main class 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 but more in the bank than in the field 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.490
 so I did get a first-class at the few mulder's injuries 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.830
 forced to stop playing football and then made the conscious decision to 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.109
 become a youth trainer 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.819
 yes because I have complaints I have had surgery on a hernia twice so I am me 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.380
 did you also opt for the trainers profession? 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.090
 we have stopped all the tidings and were happier than rewarded 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.140
 is that that has been for the youth 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.440
 yes yes because I am hopeful of services at Groningen with, for example, a teacher 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.660
 it is good working with with one the cube off with the known media 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.640
 speaker of them the coach of fc groningen is someone who is very sympathetic 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 during the game against his players in the field on the bench 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.280
 involved in the game but I can wonder 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.610
 quite new 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
 then it can be crazy guys 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
 Bruins back to win last year 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 sit next to the options 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.440
 bailly heijkoop I sympathize with those guys it is real and me 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.470
 try to help his game to get the law right that the group needs 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 played too bad 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.690
 so what do you see typical 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.040
 yes but I look forward to turning back in 2013 the hague the hague is coming 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.300
 an end to it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.600
 to be ready 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 sometimes that is critical because of the critical way but also very often because of that 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.840
 hey boys was also considering it was just a stinking game 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.680
 do best 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.320
 so i have to say i'm on a 9 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.920
 own 3 day all 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 breda amsterdam investors it was a good start last year had a hard time 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.240
 we have a hard time this year too, but I think we will give you something step by step 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:13.980
 better 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.500
 and you can also be sure that they go through the fire one by one 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 negative sound and during the match between even if you stand behind 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.279
 and m the elections 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.389
 at the court 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 but that is normal 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.790
 he normally gets to touch eu countries but it doesn't matter much 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.339
 only then boys 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.899
 this year already back at az 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.899
 the latest contract on the framework contract 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.119
 but stopped 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:01.399
 2 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.839
 the bruyn agent says 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.889
 lay my mind 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 but sir 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.419
 Rick Mulder currently expresses the ambition to be as short-term as 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.229
 head coach to get started somewhere 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.349
 He is still having a good time with the youth. My ambitions have passed 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.759
 almost a miracle to train at the moment I am fine with it 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.189
 sense 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.889
 for the time being he will stay behind with this group of parties 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.000
 at 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 oomen art 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.869
 his state now 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:39.859
 we were in ninth place ria group this was the leader in the acer 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.599
 I still thought it was reasonable to play and unfortunately you will 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
 Ajax 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.409
 fortunately the residents have 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.019
 frontrunner almere city fc was a size too big for the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.499
 victory by fc groningen 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.799
 Almere City won the competition with four weeks 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.369
 I don't think it's necessary 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.879
 we perform travel 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:03.709
 good luck because there are
