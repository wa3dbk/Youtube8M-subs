00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.880
A 34-year-old man stood
before the Rotorua District Court

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.440
charged with killing 22-year-old
Joe Collier on Sunday night.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.680
A 20-year-old individual
was also charged

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.120
at Whakatane Court today

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.880
in connection
with last Sunday night's events.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.600
Let's cross over now
to Kereama Wright

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.560
who was at Rotorua
District Court today.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.160
Kereama, can you tell us the latest?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.280
Oriini, the accused appeared
before the judge this morning

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.960
for about five minutes.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.360
The judge consented
to name suppression

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.920
that will be enforced until 6 August
when the individual is due

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.040
to make another court appearance
in Tauranga.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.040
Three others were also brought
into custody today

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.200
in relation to the events
surrounding the incident

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.920
at Whakatane Court and have been
remanded in custody until Friday.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.440
A 20-year-old man
has also been charged

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.160
for using his vehicle as a weapon

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.680
during the brawl
that broke out on Sunday night.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.160
He's set to appear again in court
in Opotiki next month.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.880
You were in Opotiki yesterday -

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.360
can you tell us
what the mood was like?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.800
My cameraman, Zane,
and I arrived at about 1pm,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.320
and the air was thick
with fear and concern

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.600
amongst Opotiki residents.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.040
We stumbled across a house swarming
with Black Power members and police.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.280
They had just been assaulted
by members of the Mongrel Mob,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120
trashing houses and cars,
among other things.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.840
It was an act of revenge
that began yesterday.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.640
I spoke to some of them,
and they told me that it's to avenge

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.280
the death of their friend
on Sunday.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.040
Where's Collier's body
at the moment?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.880
Collier's body is being returned
to Omarumutu, east of Opotiki.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.280
For the last two days,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.880
the body has been kept in Rotorua

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.160
until things
settled down in Opotiki,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
then the family decided
to keep the body there

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.000
until the victim's father
in Rangipo Prison

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800
could be released for the funeral,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.080
but due to safety concerns,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.760
with the man that stands accused
also being in Rotorua,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.960
his request has been denied.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.520
Joe Collier's body was taken

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.400
to his father at Rangipo Prison
this morning for two hours.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.560
They're now on their way home.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.240
It's believed Joe Collier
will be laid to rest this Friday.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.400
Thank you Kereama Wright
for bringing us up to speed.
