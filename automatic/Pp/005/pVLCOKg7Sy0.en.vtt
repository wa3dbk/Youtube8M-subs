a little PSA on this no it is not a
Toyota<00:00:27.340> timing<00:00:27.669> belt<00:00:27.820> indeed<00:00:28.390> it<00:00:28.689> is<00:00:28.840> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
Toyota timing belt indeed it is the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.620 
Toyota timing belt indeed it is the
gates<00:00:30.130> timing<00:00:30.579> belt<00:00:30.790> then<00:00:31.180> I<00:00:31.210> made<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.450> video

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
gates timing belt then I made a video

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.920 
gates timing belt then I made a video
about<00:00:32.910> towards<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.090> beginning<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.750> van

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
about towards the beginning of the van

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.750 
about towards the beginning of the van
build<00:00:35.410> series<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:38.980> have<00:00:39.130> watched<00:00:39.400> any

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
build series and if you have watched any

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.600 
build series and if you have watched any
of<00:00:39.880> my<00:00:40.000> other<00:00:40.300> videos<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:41.050> saw<00:00:41.680> that<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.340> was

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
of my other videos you saw that I was

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.700 
of my other videos you saw that I was
having<00:00:42.760> some<00:00:43.060> noise<00:00:43.270> coming<00:00:43.570> from<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.020> timing

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
having some noise coming from the timing

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.670 
having some noise coming from the timing
belt<00:00:44.829> area<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:46.110> after<00:00:47.110> further

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
belt area and after further

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.420 
belt area and after further
investigation<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:49.950> took<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> mechanic

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
investigation I took it to a mechanic

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.360 
investigation I took it to a mechanic
and<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.989> both<00:00:53.170> kind<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.470> concluded<00:00:53.950> that<00:00:54.070> it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
and we both kind of concluded that it

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.850 
and we both kind of concluded that it
was<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.150> the<00:00:55.510> idler<00:00:55.810> bearings<00:00:56.140> they<00:00:56.680> were

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
was the the idler bearings they were

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.450 
was the the idler bearings they were
pretty<00:00:57.310> sure<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.610> was<00:00:57.760> either<00:00:57.970> bearings<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.430> I

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
pretty sure it was either bearings so I

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.079 
pretty sure it was either bearings so I
said<00:01:00.700> okay<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:03.430> ahead<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.670> replace<00:01:03.820> it

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
said okay and go ahead and replace it

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.819 
said okay and go ahead and replace it
and<00:01:04.239> by<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.839> way<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.170> mechanic<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.680> actually

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
and by the way the mechanic I actually

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.560 
and by the way the mechanic I actually
went<00:01:06.100> ahead<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.369> took<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.640> two<00:01:07.180> Toyota

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
went ahead and took it to two Toyota

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.849 
went ahead and took it to two Toyota
since<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:09.119> something<00:01:10.119> that<00:01:10.259> I<00:01:11.259> don't

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
since this is something that I don't

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.469 
since this is something that I don't
really<00:01:12.039> want<00:01:12.249> to<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.729> wouldn't<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.210> want<00:01:13.389> to

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
really want to I wouldn't really want to

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.539 
really want to I wouldn't really want to
mess<00:01:13.659> around<00:01:13.810> with<00:01:14.139> I<00:01:14.259> can<00:01:14.560> do<00:01:14.710> most<00:01:15.069> kind<00:01:15.460> of

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
mess around with I can do most kind of

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.569 
mess around with I can do most kind of
repairs<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:15.969> indeed<00:01:16.450> I<00:01:16.859> did<00:01:17.859> replace<00:01:18.460> the

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
repairs and indeed I did replace the

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.020 
repairs and indeed I did replace the
timing<00:01:18.759> belt<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.270> this<00:01:19.539> vehicle<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.700> wanted

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030

I'm<00:02:37.580> satisfied<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.209> quality<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.690> work

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
I'm satisfied with the quality of work

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.960 
I'm satisfied with the quality of work
that<00:02:39.870> they've<00:02:40.140> done<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.770> far<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.820> both

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that they've done so far on for both

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.470 
that they've done so far on for both
times<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:43.170> taken<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.650> van<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.010> them<00:02:44.480> but

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
times I have taken the van to them but

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
times I have taken the van to them but
yeah<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.989> anyway<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.100> had<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> terrible<00:02:48.180> time

yeah so anyway I had a terrible time
trying<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.020> ahold<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.260> them<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.000> they<00:02:51.000> end

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
trying to get ahold of them and they end

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.370 
trying to get ahold of them and they end
up<00:02:51.180> getting<00:02:51.270> ahold<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.630> me<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> next<00:02:52.050> day<00:02:52.170> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
up getting ahold of me the next day and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.699 
up getting ahold of me the next day and
said<00:02:52.790> vans<00:02:53.790> ready<00:02:54.000> oh<00:02:54.209> by<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.660> way<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.380> wasn't

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
said vans ready oh by the way it wasn't

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.199 
said vans ready oh by the way it wasn't
the<00:02:55.769> idler<00:02:56.010> bearings<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.610> was<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> timing<00:02:57.090> belt

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
the idler bearings it was a timing belt

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.090 
the idler bearings it was a timing belt
it<00:02:58.019> was<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.170> timing<00:02:58.350> belt<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.709> was<00:02:58.799> making

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
it was a timing belt that was making

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.830 
it was a timing belt that was making
noise<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.070> PSA<00:03:02.570> I'm<00:03:03.570> going<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
noise so this is just a PSA I'm going to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.300 
noise so this is just a PSA I'm going to
splice<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.380> noise<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.920> was<00:03:05.070> hearing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
splice in the noise that I was hearing

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:33.750 
splice in the noise that I was hearing
here

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.850 

and<00:03:34.629> if<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.170> were<00:03:35.290> hearing<00:03:35.470> noise<00:03:37.170> which<00:03:38.170> to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
and if you were hearing noise which to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.500 
and if you were hearing noise which to
me<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.489> initial<00:03:39.879> thought<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.299> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
me and the initial thought of the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.479 
me and the initial thought of the
mechanic<00:03:41.110> thought<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.709> was<00:03:41.860> an<00:03:41.950> idler<00:03:42.220> bearing

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
mechanic thought it was an idler bearing

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.339 
mechanic thought it was an idler bearing
it<00:03:42.670> might<00:03:43.030> not<00:03:43.239> be<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.599> idler<00:03:43.900> bearing<00:03:44.170> it

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
it might not be the idler bearing it

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.820 
it might not be the idler bearing it
might<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.860> be<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.849> timing<00:03:46.090> belt<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.830> even

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
might just be the timing belt and even

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.530 
might just be the timing belt and even
Toyota<00:03:48.159> and<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.400> mechanic<00:03:48.760> admitted<00:03:49.150> there

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
Toyota and the mechanic admitted there

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.030 
Toyota and the mechanic admitted there
was<00:03:49.569> nothing<00:03:49.989> wrong<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:50.470> installation

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
was nothing wrong with the installation

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.070 
was nothing wrong with the installation

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
everything was done properly as it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.059 
everything was done properly as it
should<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.349> been<00:03:53.879> nothing<00:03:54.879> looked<00:03:55.360> bad

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
should have been nothing looked bad

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.559 
should have been nothing looked bad

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
about here I inspected it and actually

here<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.430> California<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.120> then<00:04:37.240> have

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
here in California and then have

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.839 
here in California and then have
something<00:04:37.810> catastrophic<00:04:38.380> happen<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.760> know

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
something catastrophic happen you know

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.670 
something catastrophic happen you know
I'm<00:04:39.970> willing<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.300> take<00:04:40.720> chances<00:04:40.780> with<00:04:41.380> things

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
I'm willing to take chances with things

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.719 
I'm willing to take chances with things
like<00:04:41.860> accessories<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:44.470> know<00:04:44.729> alternators

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
like accessories you know alternators

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.430 
like accessories you know alternators
and<00:04:45.760> stuff<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.450> because<00:04:46.630> that's<00:04:46.900> stuff

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
and stuff like that because that's stuff

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.409 
and stuff like that because that's stuff
I<00:04:47.590> may<00:04:47.800> or<00:04:47.889> may<00:04:48.010> not<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.580> able<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.849> replace<00:04:49.090> but

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
I may or may not be able to replace but

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.230 
I may or may not be able to replace but
it's<00:04:49.570> also<00:04:49.720> not<00:04:49.990> catastrophic<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.789> dies<00:04:52.000> on

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
it's also not catastrophic if it dies on

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.659 
it's also not catastrophic if it dies on
the<00:04:52.330> road<00:04:52.950> anyway<00:04:53.950> right<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> little<00:04:54.520> bit

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
the road anyway right a little bit

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.040 
the road anyway right a little bit
longer<00:04:54.910> than<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.120> thought<00:04:55.150> on<00:04:55.389> this<00:04:55.510> video<00:04:55.780> but

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
longer than I thought on this video but

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.640 
longer than I thought on this video but
just<00:04:56.320> a<00:04:56.410> PSA<00:04:57.330> if<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.810> replace<00:04:59.200> your<00:04:59.320> timing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
just a PSA if you replace your timing

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.610 
just a PSA if you replace your timing
belt<00:04:59.680> with<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.880> gates<00:05:01.270> timing<00:05:01.660> belt<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:02.440> may

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
belt with a gates timing belt you may

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.170 
belt with a gates timing belt you may
have<00:05:02.830> some<00:05:03.039> noise<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.550> apparently<00:05:04.030> during

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
have some noise and apparently during

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.940 
have some noise and apparently during
doing<00:05:04.750> my<00:05:04.840> research<00:05:05.139> this<00:05:05.320> is<00:05:05.500> quite<00:05:05.710> common

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
doing my research this is quite common

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.890 
doing my research this is quite common
not<00:05:06.580> not<00:05:07.450> particularly

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
not not particularly

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.070 
not not particularly
not<00:05:08.260> this<00:05:08.650> noise<00:05:08.919> in<00:05:09.130> particular<00:05:09.690> but<00:05:10.690> timing

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
not this noise in particular but timing

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.140 
not this noise in particular but timing
belt<00:05:11.320> noise<00:05:11.530> from<00:05:11.650> gates<00:05:11.889> timing<00:05:12.190> belts<00:05:12.430> so

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
belt noise from gates timing belts so

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:32.070 
belt noise from gates timing belts so
here's<00:05:13.599> what<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.810> sounds<00:05:14.020> like<00:05:14.050> now

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.529 

and<00:05:33.080> yeah<00:05:33.439> sounds<00:05:34.129> okay<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.819> granted<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:35.389> only

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
and yeah sounds okay I granted I only

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.779 
and yeah sounds okay I granted I only
have<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:36.050> few<00:05:36.680> hundred<00:05:37.009> miles<00:05:37.189> on<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.610> belt

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
have a few hundred miles on the belt

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.740 
have a few hundred miles on the belt
maybe<00:05:38.090> so<00:05:39.020> we'll<00:05:39.199> see<00:05:39.439> if<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:40.270> holds<00:05:41.270> up<00:05:41.539> if

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
maybe so we'll see if it holds up if

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.469 
maybe so we'll see if it holds up if
it's<00:05:42.080> if<00:05:42.469> it<00:05:42.620> stays<00:05:43.069> not<00:05:43.729> squeaky<00:05:44.030> like<00:05:44.300> this

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
it's if it stays not squeaky like this

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.999 
it's if it stays not squeaky like this
actually<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:44.960> gates<00:05:45.199> timing<00:05:45.530> belt<00:05:45.710> didn't

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
actually the gates timing belt didn't

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.240 
actually the gates timing belt didn't
start<00:05:46.189> squeaking<00:05:46.930> until<00:05:47.930> maybe<00:05:48.379> about<00:05:48.530> eight

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
start squeaking until maybe about eight

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.159 
start squeaking until maybe about eight
thousand<00:05:49.789> miles<00:05:49.939> eight<00:05:50.479> or<00:05:50.629> nine<00:05:50.750> thousand

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
thousand miles eight or nine thousand

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.320 
thousand miles eight or nine thousand
miles<00:05:51.319> after<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:51.860> replaced<00:05:52.250> it<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:52.669> I'm<00:05:53.210> gonna

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
miles after I replaced it so I'm gonna

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.209 
miles after I replaced it so I'm gonna
keep<00:05:53.449> tabs<00:05:53.659> on<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:53.900> but<00:05:54.110> anyways<00:05:54.349> guys<00:05:54.530> um<00:05:54.889> I

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
keep tabs on it but anyways guys um I

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.129 
keep tabs on it but anyways guys um I
just<00:05:55.610> wanted<00:05:55.849> to<00:05:55.969> do<00:05:56.090> a<00:05:56.120> little<00:05:56.330> PSA<00:05:56.810> about

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
just wanted to do a little PSA about

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.140 
just wanted to do a little PSA about
gates<00:05:57.379> timing<00:05:57.949> belts<00:05:58.219> and<00:05:58.490> I'm<00:05:58.729> not<00:05:58.909> knocking

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
gates timing belts and I'm not knocking

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.029 
gates timing belts and I'm not knocking
them<00:05:59.389> I'm<00:05:59.900> not<00:06:00.259> saying<00:06:00.469> they're<00:06:00.620> bad<00:06:00.650> actually

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
them I'm not saying they're bad actually

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.129 
them I'm not saying they're bad actually
I<00:06:01.219> put<00:06:01.340> one<00:06:01.490> on<00:06:01.610> my<00:06:01.699> Subaru<00:06:01.879> as<00:06:02.240> well<00:06:02.419> just

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
I put one on my Subaru as well just

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.950 
I put one on my Subaru as well just
saying<00:06:03.379> if<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:03.740> hear<00:06:04.039> noise<00:06:04.719> could<00:06:05.719> be<00:06:05.779> the

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
saying if you hear noise could be the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.390 
saying if you hear noise could be the
timing<00:06:06.139> belt<00:06:06.319> might<00:06:06.889> not<00:06:07.039> be<00:06:07.129> the<00:06:07.250> height<00:06:07.370> of

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
timing belt might not be the height of

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.050 
timing belt might not be the height of
the<00:06:07.520> bearings

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
the bearings

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.610 
the bearings
sorry<00:06:08.330> guys<00:06:08.449> guys<00:06:08.689> thanks<00:06:09.110> for<00:06:09.199> watching

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
sorry guys guys thanks for watching

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.340
