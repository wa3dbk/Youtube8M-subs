00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.210
 but for this gruel blyat porcupines 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.359
 but apparently very much 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.399
 there we see what happened poor 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.399
 animals 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.399
 but got scared and went on the attack to write off 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800

 Yuri Zhevnov 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 at the end of last year 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.020

 Kirinsky GKM 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
 strange flows on what trace of a cold 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.289
 often people just reference source 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869
 and suddenly he will do one more time 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.339
 this package is rubble 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.339
