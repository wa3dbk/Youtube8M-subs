protected<00:00:49.320> although<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> could<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.670> leave

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it out in this and it would probably be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639 
it out in this and it would probably be
fine<00:00:53.300> but<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> jar<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> comes<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.530> looks

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
fine but the jar that it comes and looks

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.930 
fine but the jar that it comes and looks
just<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> open<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.160> up

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I said it does not take too much it's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
I said it does not take too much it's
more<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> heavier<00:01:59.130> product<00:01:59.729> than<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
more of a heavier product than what I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
more of a heavier product than what I
was<00:02:00.509> using<00:02:00.719> before<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.159> fine<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.670> me

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
was using before but that's fine with me

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.110 
was using before but that's fine with me
I<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.799> heavier<00:02:05.189> products

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
I do like the heavier products

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.810 
I do like the heavier products
I<00:02:06.180> tend<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.230> use<00:02:07.530> those<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.430> winter

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.940 
I tend to use those more in the winter
than<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> summer<00:02:09.510> but<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.380> have<00:02:10.619> really

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
than the summer but I have really

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.080
