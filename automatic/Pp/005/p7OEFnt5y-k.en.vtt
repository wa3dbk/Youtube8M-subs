00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.869
 the labor market 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 the share 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.729
 I can only do that 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.819
 to share on the bed 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.079
 just like with paid work 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:44.920
 and then say 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.300

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.560
 there were fewer things for the kids to do on Friday I knew a lot 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.760
 place 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.979
 all times 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.099
 these were in japan 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.690
 greatly improved 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.299
 it has no use 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.859
 one of the fifteen years with great pleasure 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.369
 and they were also put in the spotlight separately every year 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.269
 theme that is the theme this year 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.090
 this year's theme is when I grow up later and that also has to do with the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.559
 last thirty years 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.669
 look back a little look a little fruit and a goose with the 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.919
 Children actually look at what everyone wants to be and what you could become 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.399
 you can lift a little car from the veil what they are all doing 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.609

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.779

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.779

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.669

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.299
 shut down 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.449
