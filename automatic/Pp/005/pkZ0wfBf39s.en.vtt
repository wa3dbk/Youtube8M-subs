changed this is any factory property
you'll<00:00:48.200> notice<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.559> conveyors<00:00:49.190> now<00:00:49.430> have<00:00:49.670> a

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
you'll notice that conveyors now have a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.080 
you'll notice that conveyors now have a
motor<00:00:50.059> direction<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:52.100> motor<00:00:52.340> marks<00:00:52.789> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
motor direction the motor marks the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.529 
motor direction the motor marks the
front<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.840> conveyor<00:00:55.300> let's<00:00:56.300> see<00:00:56.449> what

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
front of the conveyor let's see what

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:07.700 
front of the conveyor let's see what
happens<00:00:56.960> when<00:00:57.079> we<00:00:57.199> run<00:00:57.230> this<00:00:57.590> scene

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.900 

you'll<00:01:08.710> notice<00:01:09.010> on<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.220> first<00:01:09.490> slide<00:01:09.610> when

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
you'll notice on the first slide when

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.760 
you'll notice on the first slide when
the<00:01:10.000> boxes<00:01:10.390> hit<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.750> third<00:01:11.080> conveyor<00:01:11.530> they

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the boxes hit the third conveyor they

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.190 
the boxes hit the third conveyor they
stopped<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.910> on<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> second<00:01:13.540> line<00:01:13.690> when<00:01:14.110> they

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
stopped and on the second line when they

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.380 
stopped and on the second line when they
hit<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.470> y<00:01:14.650> merge<00:01:14.890> they<00:01:15.130> stopped<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.730> on<00:01:16.240> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
hit the y merge they stopped and on the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.380 
hit the y merge they stopped and on the
branch<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:17.110> boxes<00:01:17.500> fall<00:01:17.680> off<00:01:17.830> backwards<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
branch the boxes fall off backwards this

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.090 
branch the boxes fall off backwards this
is<00:01:19.540> because<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.110> conveyor<00:01:20.440> directions

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
is because the conveyor directions

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.520 
is because the conveyor directions
aren't<00:01:21.430> going<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.850> right<00:01:22.000> way<00:01:22.230> so<00:01:23.230> let's<00:01:23.380> try

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
aren't going the right way so let's try

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.310 
aren't going the right way so let's try
to<00:01:23.590> fix<00:01:23.830> this<00:01:24.780> let's<00:01:25.780> click<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> third

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
to fix this let's click the third

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.160 
to fix this let's click the third
conveyor<00:01:26.710> here<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.510> can<00:01:28.660> reverse<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
conveyor here and we can reverse the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.980 
conveyor here and we can reverse the
direction<00:01:29.910> you'll<00:01:30.910> notice<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.420> conveyor<00:01:31.780> was

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
direction you'll notice the conveyor was

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.650 
direction you'll notice the conveyor was
put<00:01:32.230> on<00:01:32.320> backwards<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.850> let's<00:01:37.030> go<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.300> this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
put on backwards now let's go to this

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.260 
put on backwards now let's go to this
one<00:01:37.950> similarly<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.550> can<00:01:39.700> reverse<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:41.350> motor

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
one similarly we can reverse this motor

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.780 
one similarly we can reverse this motor
then<00:01:43.270> if<00:01:43.390> we<00:01:43.510> click<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.870> Y<00:01:44.050> merge<00:01:44.790> you'll

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
then if we click the Y merge you'll

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.910 
then if we click the Y merge you'll
notice<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.330> branch<00:01:46.600> Direction<00:01:47.200> default<00:01:47.680> is

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
notice the branch Direction default is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.780 
notice the branch Direction default is
out<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.940> we<00:01:49.060> want<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.510> branch<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.960> go<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.790> so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
out but we want the branch to go in so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.570 
out but we want the branch to go in so
we<00:01:51.910> can<00:01:51.940> change<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.690> N<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:54.160> also<00:01:54.310> need

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
we can change that to N and we also need

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.080 
we can change that to N and we also need
to<00:01:54.610> change<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.150> motor<00:01:55.600> direction<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.530> reverse

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to change the motor direction to reverse

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.170 
to change the motor direction to reverse
now<00:01:58.090> let's<00:01:58.270> see<00:01:58.390> what<00:01:58.510> happens<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:03.910> can

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
now let's see what happens now you can

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.460 
now let's see what happens now you can
see<00:02:04.330> all<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.510> conveyors<00:02:04.930> are<00:02:05.170> go<00:02:05.290> on<00:02:05.380> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
see all the conveyors are go on the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.410 
see all the conveyors are go on the
right<00:02:05.620> direction<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.910> can<00:02:07.030> also<00:02:07.150> change

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
right direction you can also change

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.389 
right direction you can also change
other<00:02:07.720> properties<00:02:08.260> for<00:02:08.590> example<00:02:08.649> let's

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
other properties for example let's

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.430 
other properties for example let's
select<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.790> generator<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.510> let's<00:02:11.200> say<00:02:11.320> we

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
select the generator and let's say we

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.250 
select the generator and let's say we
only<00:02:11.590> want<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.190> have<00:02:12.340> red<00:02:12.610> boxes<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:14.170> can

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
only want it to have red boxes we can

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.070 
only want it to have red boxes we can
change<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:15.510> let's<00:02:16.510> say<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.660> want<00:02:16.959> them

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
change this one let's say we want them

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.280 
change this one let's say we want them
to<00:02:17.110> be<00:02:17.260> generated<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:19.650> three<00:02:20.650> seconds<00:02:21.160> each

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
to be generated at three seconds each

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.830 
to be generated at three seconds each
then<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.560> change<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.130> over<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
then we can change this one over here to
