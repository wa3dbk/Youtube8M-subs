00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
about it right now in that water it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
about it right now in that water it's
like<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:05.060> this<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.890> um

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
like not actually water it's this but um

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
like not actually water it's this but um
we<00:01:08.729> can't<00:01:08.909> criticize<00:01:09.329> it<00:01:09.509> too<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.840> all

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
we can't criticize it too much all

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.210 
we can't criticize it too much all
because<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> working

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because you know that this is working

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
because you know that this is working
progress<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.420> he<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:12.930> just

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
progress and I think he was like just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
progress and I think he was like just
coming<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> was

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
coming out with this and when I was

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
coming out with this and when I was
thinking<00:01:15.329> about<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
thinking about this I was like well you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.099 
thinking about this I was like well you
know<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.420> could<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.899> more

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
know this one could be like a more

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.580 
know this one could be like a more
serious<00:01:19.469> slower<00:01:20.069> paced<00:01:20.460> version<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:22.229> attack

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
serious slower paced version of attack

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
serious slower paced version of attack
on<00:01:22.740> Titan<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.609> want<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.819> fast<00:01:24.119> pace

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
on Titan and if you want a fast pace

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.779 
on Titan and if you want a fast pace
chibi<00:01:25.259> version<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:26.009> play<00:01:26.189> things

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
chibi version and play things

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.389 
chibi version and play things
so<00:01:27.479> things<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.109> fast-paced<00:01:28.499> cheapy<00:01:29.069> version

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
so things is a fast-paced cheapy version

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.440 
so things is a fast-paced cheapy version
and<00:01:29.639> this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.569> slower<00:01:31.020> pace

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
and this one is a slower pace

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.199 
and this one is a slower pace
more<00:01:33.450> serious<00:01:33.869> version<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.789> he<00:01:35.880> did

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
more serious version but I think he did

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.669 
more serious version but I think he did
really<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.780> good<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> design

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
really really good on the design

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.160 
really really good on the design
actually<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.789> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.389> camera<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.990> can't

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
actually out on the camera and I can't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
actually out on the camera and I can't
really<00:01:40.319> turn<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:42.299> keeps<00:01:42.450> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
really turn that well it keeps on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
really turn that well it keeps on
getting<00:01:42.749> off<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> screen<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
getting off of the screen of what is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.399 
getting off of the screen of what is
going<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.700> now

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
going on right now

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.989 
going on right now
but<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.659> what's<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.529> is<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.859> on<00:01:50.009> okay

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
but but what's it what is going on okay

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.800 
but but what's it what is going on okay

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that was weird

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you can get out of the wall so I've been

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.029 
you can get out of the wall so I've been
trying<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> run<00:01:58.139> to<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.859> place

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
trying to run to that because this place

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.989 
trying to run to that because this place
is<00:01:59.189> pretty<00:01:59.670> freaking<00:02:00.299> big<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:01.789> this<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:02.969> a

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
is pretty freaking big and this is a

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.919 
is pretty freaking big and this is a
place<00:02:03.359> where<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.719> guess<00:02:03.959> Aaron<00:02:04.380> grew<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:06.719> see

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
place where I guess Aaron grew up to see

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.160 
place where I guess Aaron grew up to see
they<00:02:07.139> got<00:02:07.259> breached<00:02:07.619> by<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.270> colossal<00:02:09.990> Titan

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
they got breached by the colossal Titan

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.839

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
we were pretty good oh he has like a

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.319 
we were pretty good oh he has like a
little<00:03:18.540> shops<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.349> whatnot<00:03:19.939> the<00:03:20.939> only<00:03:21.150> ones

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
little shops and whatnot the only ones

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.289 
little shops and whatnot the only ones
here<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.200> there's<00:03:22.379> one<00:03:22.530> tree<00:03:23.120> yeah<00:03:24.120> it's

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
here I think there's one tree yeah it's

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.550 
here I think there's one tree yeah it's
a<00:03:24.359> one<00:03:24.510> tree<00:03:24.750> right<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.109> guess<00:03:25.319> he's<00:03:25.530> just

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
a one tree right there I guess he's just

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.899 
a one tree right there I guess he's just
testing<00:03:25.950> out<00:03:26.250> how<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.549> looks

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909
