actually would clean themselves rubbing
against<00:03:00.730> each<00:03:00.879> other<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
against each other but I think the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.780 
against each other but I think the
gravel<00:03:02.230> sort<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.799> addition<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.579> helping

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
gravel sort of in addition to helping

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.629 
gravel sort of in addition to helping
clean<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.299> coins<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:05.590> separates<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.310> coins

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
and you'll get them cleaner a lot

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.059

quicker<00:03:09.389> alright<00:03:10.389> next<00:03:10.840> step<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.560> couple<00:03:12.010> of

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
quicker alright next step a couple of

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.509 
quicker alright next step a couple of
squirts<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.549> dishwashing<00:03:12.940> liquid<00:03:14.310> not<00:03:15.310> too

and start counting
I<00:06:05.650> just<00:06:05.949> stood<00:06:06.070> there<00:06:06.310> smiling<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:07.290> when<00:06:08.290> she
