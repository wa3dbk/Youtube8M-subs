00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.440
 marble cake has its big appearance 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.960
 usually on birthdays that likes it 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.369
 I love him so much 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.699
 show you a lot now and we succeed 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.140
 marble cake will be particularly juicy 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.860
 light and dark green dough 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.100
 baked 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.510
 for that we need butter sugar 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.810
 vanilla sugar baking powder a bit 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.390
 Milk eggs and flour and for the dark 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.190
 still cocoa sugar and also a dough 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.920
 little world and we start now 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.649
 the preparation of the previous day but before 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.239
 another tip to the ingredients of butter eggs 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.219
 and milk should all three 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.870
 room temperature that is two 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.769
 hours before you just start from the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.329
 take a fridge 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.249
 so they connect well to one 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.780
 homogeneous mass and that leads to that 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.079
 the cake gets nicely liquid and that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.629
 we want yes we need one 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:05.950
 mixing bowl because complicated room warm 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:08.520
 butter then mixa and take the butter 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.520
 stir frothy 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.420
 parallel you let gradually the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.420
 pour in sugar 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.740
 The whole thing will definitely take three four 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.060
 minutes because the sugar dissolve such 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 if continue to trickle 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.540
 from 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.140
 so that you are done you can too 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.969
 recognize that the mass now completely 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.380
 has become bright no longer as with the 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.630
 Butter was a bit yellow but 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.929
 now is the beautiful bright than this 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.819
 the eggs come to each one of them 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.719
 stir for about half 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.219
 minute 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.030
 so the dough film with the 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.030
 connect 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 who will make his cake fruity and whole 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.940
 especially juicy likes easy 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 a ripe crushed banana to it and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.930
 stir the whole thing again 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.490
 come next and baking powder for 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.450
 just add some flour and for that 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.450
 Mix baking powder 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.710
 and then the dough they hire for it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.710
 she just put it on 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.970
 and gives the flour then out into the dough 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.220
 This ensures that the dough is especially 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.220
 becomes airy 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.090
 so 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.090
 Let's lose his mail fog first 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.080
 and the rest 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 1 s 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.870
 finished is the bright stirs so the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.360
 light dough we now feel to two 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.790
 thirds in a springform with pipe 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.709
 ground use, this thing is enough here 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.709
 I put it in now 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.620
 so and the rest we do now 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.290
 a dark breeze out by us 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:15.220
 to give the cocoa once on seven of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.609
 comcom then a little sugar 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.199
 shot milk 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.199
 and extend the whole thing again 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.659
 perfect the dark sponge coming 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.659
 right on the light right now 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.010
 distribute evenly along the shape 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.770
 so that it will now marble cake 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.080
 for it takes in the fork and ride with 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.060
 the fork always in such a way by the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.760
 dough that has the effect that the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.230
 bright day with the dark dough like that 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.230
 mixed 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.230
 so 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.720
 once along 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.010
 that's it already 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.630
 the dough comes the 250 minutes at 180 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.040
 degree top and bottom heat in the oven 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.080
 I have a trick you can see if 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.090
 the cake is ready just take it 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.280
 wooden sticks put that in the customer 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.750
 pure and if no day stays alive 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.750
 then the cake is ready 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.169
 a little extra powdered sugar on it 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.669
 Finish the marble cake perfectly 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.669
 Have fun baking
