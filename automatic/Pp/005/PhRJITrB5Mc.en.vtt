worn like this can you see the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.899 
worn like this can you see the
difference<00:01:34.990> when<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.260> happens<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.549> risk

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
difference when this happens you risk

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.070 
difference when this happens you risk
breaking<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.840> disc<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:41.299> can

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
breaking on the disc and this can

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.430 
breaking on the disc and this can
stretch<00:01:42.590> or<00:01:42.950> break<00:01:43.280> them<00:01:44.049> changing<00:01:45.049> your<00:01:45.200> pads

stretch or break them changing your pads

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.219 
stretch or break them changing your pads
promptly<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.979> much<00:01:46.280> better<00:01:46.700> both<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.840> terms<00:01:48.080> of

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
promptly is much better both in terms of

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.340 
promptly is much better both in terms of
braking<00:01:48.710> performance<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.460> your<00:01:49.970> hip<00:01:50.119> pocket
