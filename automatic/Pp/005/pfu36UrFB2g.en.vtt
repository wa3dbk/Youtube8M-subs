00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone i'm coming back 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 today to introduce you to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.840
 books so following a style of play 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.630
 you with them I from my collection that I 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.100
 would like to introduce parents 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.900
 So here I present you 5 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:29.789
 the first but fabulous coloring 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:33.590
 so this deal with nokia cover 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.110
 hardback with different patterns 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.320
 I find them really pretty you have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 pages with noah with black pork 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.629
 while you have to eiffage with the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 white background that's really it's true 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.360
 infective close that's it to say small 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.670
 girl it's really games 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.670
 sorry sign of cut tails 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:14.030
 I started this even if it 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:20.240
 allows to hide cabinets teapots 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:33.500
 the acrobatic trapeze artists and rather 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:33.500
 number one dog discovered it seems 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 so this one he is he is really not 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.900
 badly I do not find pretty in addition to the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 hard cover holy do not know 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.250
 it's really not me I like 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.170
 decorate hard covers 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 since according to or angers there is a tail 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.600
 email to the box and suddenly we can 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.979
 rely on the carton 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 that's the first time it's often 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.369
 the case the ideas then arose forgotten from 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.000
 tell you this one is a game the countries to 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.150
 8,90 will be my zone 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.290
 the caleido me it is this side of 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.290
 mandalas is that mandalas on bottom 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.290
 black 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 I made a few hours but I 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.210
 vetoes actually work in fact it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.370
 no I feel detachable ja 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.420
 small small housings blow 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.070
 we can detach them so that's the one 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.960
 who loved that I'm doing 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:48.750
 also and that one I think I 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.700
 paid 5.90 if my memories are correct 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.880
 So here is a book thirty years ago 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.980
 mandala actually the alasay 120's in am 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.050
 where it's one of my first boeing 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.570
 that I actually bought so there was 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.330
 past because it's not done now 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.700
 there in fact I found that we do that 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.040
 it's not a mandala 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.220
 but the deaths are super and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.580
 Moreover, we find them in months 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.650
 the morning the zenn the small format to 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 104,90 or something like that in the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.350
 small formats you know I can not 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.080
 to show you because I did not have because 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.750
 that I had a game the data because 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:46.680
 me it did not suit me and I like 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.680
 not so here is against that it goes through 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.790
 I like I prefer to do a pencil 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.890
 or if we throw this one and I am 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.970
 the agent hunt 90 and that's it then 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.250
 that's really the one of those two 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.890
 and there 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.660
 I really know the two that I have 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.459
 ordered first when I 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.709
 started to cover 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.950
 it's really the two books that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.630
 I ordered with garden secret garden 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.930
 secret I will not introduce it to you 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.820
 because it makes you send images 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.470
 everywhere you type secret garden on 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:38.540
 google and you will have one 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.760
 an image library on google if 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:49.020
 there's nothing to what I'll show you 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:52.050
 not so the mandalas so in fact it's 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.380
 that mandalas but it remains a text 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.840
 so it's page style pages 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.580
 printer 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.820
 I think you said it I 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.230
 paid for the games it's not at all 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.400
 her daughter 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.570
 I mean that barely more than 200 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:15.660
 points so here's that one then I have 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:20.780
 not done at all so that's definitely 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.780
 dallas so it's that mandates the 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.260
 voice if you have a taste of his children 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.730
 who will travel to that one we follow there 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.730
 I did a little bit more 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:45.480
 it's right now so less that I 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.420
 really prefer what I do not want 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.070
 to think in fact I do not want to 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.840
 reflect 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:57.540
 I open that and I know it is 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.920
 really story of letting go 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.290
 completely since there is no 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:07.340
 cheated 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:10.430
 this is this video 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.919
 DC is not that May was sad 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.949
 so I invite you always to us 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:20.750
 join on the coloring group 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:22.729
 coloring and anti stress drawings 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.280
 are almost 2000 in the day 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.330
 present-day 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.150
 so I do not know when is this 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.449
 video will be posted but on time 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:37.310
 of today on and 1991 does in these 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.880
 waters where I was interviewed by the 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.160
 Parisian 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.140
 so I think the 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.690
 the article should go into no 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:49.580
 a long time and so I invite you to come 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.450
 to join us we are becoming 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.560
 more numerous 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.660
 we want to accept you 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.570

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:27.100
 also since I have a blog that I do 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.880
