Vapor X 80 hockey shoulder pad so taking
a<00:00:12.450> look<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.809> front<00:00:13.110> they<00:00:13.530> use<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:13.980> high

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
a look at the front they use some high

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.919 
a look at the front they use some high
density<00:00:14.730> foams<00:00:15.030> through<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> center<00:00:15.719> back

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
density foams through the center back

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
density foams through the center back
the<00:00:16.170> plastic<00:00:16.680> inserts<00:00:17.100> giving<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.609> good

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the plastic inserts giving you that good

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
the plastic inserts giving you that good
level<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.240> protection<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.680> what

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
level of protection what I like what

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.460 
level of protection what I like what
Bauer<00:00:20.010> did<00:00:20.189> also<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> 80<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:22.109> used<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
Bauer did also on this 80 is they used a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
Bauer did also on this 80 is they used a
lot<00:00:22.680> more<00:00:22.890> segments<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.910> foam<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.810> what

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
lot more segments of this foam so what

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.269 
lot more segments of this foam so what
this<00:00:25.019> does<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> allows<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.949> move

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this does is it allows it to move

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
this does is it allows it to move
somewhat<00:00:27.029> independently<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.930> another<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
somewhat independently one another but

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
somewhat independently one another but
more<00:00:28.980> importantly<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.580> keeps<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> protection

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
more importantly it keeps the protection

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.049 
more importantly it keeps the protection
where<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.929> needs<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.520> now<00:00:32.520> looking<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
where it needs to be now looking at the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.880 
where it needs to be now looking at the
strapping<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.989> could<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.559> two

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
strapping we could see we have two

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
strapping we could see we have two
elastic<00:00:35.520> straps<00:00:35.850> attached<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.480> Velcro<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
elastic straps attached with Velcro and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
elastic straps attached with Velcro and
they<00:00:37.500> also<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:38.010> two<00:00:38.280> different<00:00:38.870> forms<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
they also have two different forms that

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
they also have two different forms that
you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.290> set<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.890> onto<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.239> just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you can set it onto so if you want just

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
you can set it onto so if you want just
a<00:00:42.570> loose<00:00:42.780> fit<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.100> if

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
a loose fit you can use this one here if

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.920 
a loose fit you can use this one here if
you<00:00:44.579> really<00:00:44.879> want<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.120> give<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> tight<00:00:45.629> fit

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you really want to give it a tight fit

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.310 
you really want to give it a tight fit
you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.680> ahead<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> throw<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.610> top

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
you can go ahead and throw it up up top

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
you can go ahead and throw it up up top
through<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> center<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> should<00:00:50.010> say<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> then

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
through the center I should say and then

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
through the center I should say and then
down<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> bottom<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.590> removable

wrap its back with medium density foams

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
wrap its back with medium density foams
and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> spin<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and then as I spin it you can see how it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
and then as I spin it you can see how it
exposes<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.470> bicep<00:01:28.740> guard<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.150> see

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
exposes this bicep guard now you can see

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.870 
exposes this bicep guard now you can see
it<00:01:30.420> has<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.079> solid<00:01:31.470> wrap<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it has a really solid wrap to it it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
it has a really solid wrap to it it
covers<00:01:33.259> majority<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> outside<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> the

covers majority of the outside of the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
covers majority of the outside of the
arm<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.880> protected<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
arm so you're well protected it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
arm so you're well protected it's
attached<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> cap<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
attached right down into the cap so you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.580 
attached right down into the cap so you
don't<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.880> any<00:01:39.030> adjustability<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:40.200> still

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
don't have any adjustability but still

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.770 
don't have any adjustability but still
just<00:01:40.770> move<00:01:41.009> independently<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> can

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
just move independently and then you can

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980 
just move independently and then you can
see<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.259> more<00:01:44.299> velcro<00:01:45.299> strap<00:01:45.659> here

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
see we have one more velcro strap here

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
see we have one more velcro strap here
one<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.040> forgot<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.430> mention<00:01:47.549> too<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
one thing I forgot to mention too is the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.780 
one thing I forgot to mention too is the
dynamic<00:01:48.689> flex<00:01:49.049> arch<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:50.040> allows<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
dynamic flex arch which allows the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.359 
dynamic flex arch which allows the
shoulder<00:01:51.090> cap<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> move<00:01:51.780> over<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> top<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
shoulder cap to move over the top of the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
shoulder cap to move over the top of the
arch<00:01:53.520> protection<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.049> going

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
arch protection here so it's not going

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.319 
arch protection here so it's not going
to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.409> jamming<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.920> against<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.399> net<00:01:56.549> now

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to be jamming up against your net now

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
to be jamming up against your net now
onto<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> back<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> how<00:01:58.799> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
onto the back you can see how that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.469 
onto the back you can see how that
clavicle<00:01:59.399> protection<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.149> gives<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
clavicle protection really gives you a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
clavicle protection really gives you a
good<00:02:00.689> wrap<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.890> into<00:02:02.189> these

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
good wrap all the way into these

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
good wrap all the way into these
high-density<00:02:03.090> foam<00:02:03.409> segments<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.500> are

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
high-density foam segments that are

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620 
high-density foam segments that are
backed<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.040> plastic<00:02:05.490> inserts<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.600> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
backed with plastic inserts this is a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
backed with plastic inserts this is a
very<00:02:06.899> vital<00:02:07.140> part<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> human<00:02:08.099> body<00:02:08.250> that's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
very vital part of the human body that's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
very vital part of the human body that's
why<00:02:08.729> they're<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.209> beefed<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.720> through

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
why they're really beefed it up through

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
why they're really beefed it up through
the<00:02:09.959> center<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.099> onto<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> sides<00:02:11.790> here

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the center and then onto the sides here

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.490 
the center and then onto the sides here
we<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.660> medium

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we have medium

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
we have medium
the<00:02:13.680> foams<00:02:14.010> giving<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> some<00:02:15.000> good<00:02:15.180> coverage

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the foams giving you some good coverage

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
the foams giving you some good coverage
on<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.900> back<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.290> also<00:02:16.320> some<00:02:16.830> good<00:02:17.010> mobility

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
on the back but also some good mobility

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.850 
on the back but also some good mobility
because<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.210> segmented<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.710> as

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
because it is all segmented and then as

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.950 
because it is all segmented and then as
you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:20.310> into<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> rib<00:02:21.030> wrap<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:21.570> they

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
you can see into the rib wrap here they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.050 
you can see into the rib wrap here they
really<00:02:22.170> stepped<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.740> up<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.070> they<00:02:23.490> doubled<00:02:23.940> up

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
really stepped it up and they doubled up

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.760 
really stepped it up and they doubled up
the<00:02:24.090> medium<00:02:24.600> density<00:02:24.870> foam<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.560> giving

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
the medium density foam so it's giving

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.380 
the medium density foam so it's giving
you<00:02:25.830> good<00:02:26.040> protection<00:02:26.640> all<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> way<00:02:27.060> into<00:02:27.210> the
