00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.130
 hello in this video lesson we 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.539
 show you how to adjust 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.400
 plastic window 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.650
 if suddenly for some reason she 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.580
 start to rub in pairs or not tight 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.480
 fit for this we need 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:38.539
 hexagon set 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:45.260
 and a conventional Phillips screwdriver and so 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:47.630
 let's start plastic windows and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.710
 balcony doors are usually equipped 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.320
 two loops 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.780
 one upper and one lower 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.140
 lower loop adjusts the sash by 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.820
 up and down and right and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:10.549
 left to adjust up and down 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 remove the protective cap with we take 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.790
 hexagon from our set and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.180
 proceed to raise the sash up 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.290
 hexagon 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.880
 we twist it clockwise 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.470
 used for when the sash 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.470
 overwrites the bottom pairs 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.909
 in order to lower our sash 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.320
 if we suddenly 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.630
 rubbing on top we twist 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.840
 counterclockwise thereby lowering 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.939
 sash 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.850
 which to adjust the sash 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.590
 or right or left if 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:06.320
 starts to rub up on the sides we use 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:09.890
 another which is on the side in order 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.789
 to get to it will be more convenient 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.789
 open our window 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.989
 turning the hexagon clockwise 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.850
 clockwise or counterclockwise 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.850
 accordingly we regulate our 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.980
 sash or right or left in 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.580
 depending on which side it is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.810
 starts to take now let's go 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.810
 top loop adjustments 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.440
 upper loop adjust the sash or 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.959
 right or left 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.910
 depending on which side it is 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.099
 starts to pick up 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.900
 the sash is regulated by the same 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.430
 hexagon itself in the direction of 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.010
 clockwise or counterclockwise 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.330
 arrows respectively moving fear or 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 right or left whichever with 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.180
 which side does she start to bully 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:10.310
 after we finished adjusting 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.700
 top niche hinges and our door or window 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.420
 closes opens without rubbing the frame 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.390
 can proceed 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.640
 and adjust the squeeze sash if 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.349
 there is a need 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.299
 can be checked using normal 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:33.660
 bills when we close the sash bill 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:37.610
 must be pressed tightly between the frame and 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.610
 sash if 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.580
 bill freely walks means sash 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.110
 needs additional adjustment 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:55.640
 clamp to adjust the clamp to us 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.750
 need a key for 9 or the usual 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.440
 cool scars in this case 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
 we use maco accessories 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.230
 clamp is adjustable by turning 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.190
 eccentric clockwise or 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.709
 counter-clockwise 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.900
 thereby reducing the distance from the edge 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.510
 frame house edge accent river 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.919
 the shorter the distance , the denser 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.760
 will clamp your assembly eccentrics 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:29.210
 arranged around the perimeter of everything throughout 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.800
 sash and before proceeding to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.570
 adjustment check the places in which 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.570
 it needs to be done 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.620
 another important point to 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.320
 extend the life of your hardware and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.150
 must be kept clean 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.960
 especially pay attention to the top 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.870
 part of the casement 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.639
 since after installing the window and trim 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.180
 slopes so remains a lot of garbage 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.180
 Thanks for attention
