00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Halli hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.069
 new 45 10 ultimate team video and yes 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 we have the next one as promised 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.309
 Team this player on the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.270
 note and the animals often this 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.609
 clouds, it's probably not volkan sen 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 Unfortunately, I do not know the Turkish 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 speaking people among you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.660
 yes , and I forgive 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 that we spend two days but like most of the time 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 Clouds always called one when the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.649
 comment that said so stay in the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.610
 august right of 86 tempo 85 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.579
 dribbling and 75 fits are his main 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 attribute 65 shot still the ball 72 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 physical what his height is not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.059
 quite as bad as you have to say but 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 his shot is not quite like that said 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.219
 were bombastic at first sight 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
 in the values ​​are particularly important 87 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.160
 the remaining 82 at checks and his 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.750
 high agility agility et cetera 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 decent pace he can also, however, 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.659
 Austria is breaking the logic ford 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.909
 on both wings at home even 67 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.520
 strength what surprised me already relatively 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 did she see when you play with him 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 not really looking like he did 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.470
 so much stronger but yes why me 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 the team is quite simple at all 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.060
 what he saw that you camp 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.060
 through the prion informal kabi and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.400
 that's why it's individual at the moment 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.290
 I have to say favorite team and because 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.610
 I do not change much in the team 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.360
 wanted and thought what can i do about it 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.860
 change and can test this however 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 would like to do something great without it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.960
 change and it was just sad 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.850
 rausnehmen and volkan reinintun and yes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 that's why, as a team, not so much 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 changed and yes it has two things to me 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.649
 I do not like that at all 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.360
 and there is now so the next 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.880
 caught the negative first 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 Of course, his three spots are clouds 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 of cinema on the wing I like 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 at least four that definitely one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.850
 big disadvantage with him, however, this 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 87 dribbling you notice it with him 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.280
 So it's really very strong right now 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.200
 he mostly has the ball on his foot 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.050
 Side windows must be the whole thing 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.030
 sometimes a tick horny but yes you can 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.209
 ultimately not everything as you have 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.090
 saying goes, and therefore ranges from the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.650
 and also that there are only three 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.610
 Stables knew it has to stop 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.340
 a little bit like that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.110
 he has a good passing game good eye 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.200
 for the running against a very 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.070
 good positional play possible say all 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.070
 variations always very dangerous 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.590
 ordinary flank is sometimes as 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.020
 last of course, his shot year 165 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.550
 shot or so and only paten 60 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.070
 you can not conclude any miracles 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.810
 expect volkan if you are there 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.760
 Tried really shoot 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.209
 One hundred percent from time to time something like that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.410
 like you complete but you can do that 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.730
 so in the conclusion do not expect because 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.739
 Things were just so-called high 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.630
 conclusion gave everything nevertheless geschossen 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.720
 and at Volkan I knew that one 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.010
 fucking a conclusion has a lot of value 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.030
 made a few goals on real and 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.040
 equal makes one right 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.239
 you'll see a nice goal at least 2 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.860
 even first this triple still 1 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.989
 and yes I can give you one if you like 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.459
 daily theme deduction league team or 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.010
 I can definitely an error 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.959
 wing player does not have scribus 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.370
 but as I said for yourself good 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.470
 dribbling and very good position play 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.450
 he should not despair if there is something 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.890
 shoots but then what goes then stop 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.299
 even if it liked rate 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.220
 we should not forget 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.220
 next time and until then people in the 5th
