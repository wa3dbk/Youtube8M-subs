00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 No one wanted to be parity with the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.330
 or jack with the ultimate fantasy type game 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.540
 to follow the game was launched there is very little 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 time for playstation 4 xbox one 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.469
 In this quick video I'm going to give my 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.070
 reviews on the game I played around 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.079
 of 15 hours and only one chapter is missing 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
 for me to finish the final fantasy game 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.749
 tadinho is not an original created game 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.539
 for playstation 4 xbox uab it went 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.039
 released on psp exclusively for the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.980
 this is the first time 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.109
 was the funk is difficult is legally 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.149
 released throughout the rest of the world to 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.489
 because the game was to translate by fans and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 available for download there is a good 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 time ago was in the fantasy type-0 is a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.130
 strange game the gameplay is somewhat 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.310
 strange and the story is strange too 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.890
 but it is not by the game that it is strange that he 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.710
 be bad with him is not but for sure 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.360
 it will not please many players if 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 dealing with a game originally released 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 for psp such is possible has structure 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 of a game of laptop the phases are 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.729
 divided into rooms in each room you 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.649
 faces enemies and sometimes requires 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.170
 meet objectives such as triggering a 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.780
 device find a key to kill the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 enemy and excel and following the path of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.979
 rooms until the end you meet the boss 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 there is a good variety of enemies and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.079
 bosses are always well made and the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.479
 fights are cool and in this part of the game 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.899
 glow in my opinion the gameplay the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 fight as strange as it is 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 satisfies and is fun and depending on the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 character you are using 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.439
 combat takes place in a certain way 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.750
 almost a third schutter for a rock 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.750
 slash 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 ah 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.930
 and talking about the characters there are 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.030
 12 playable characters in civilian taipe 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.560
 each with a different weapon 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.810
 ability and movement when starting a 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.880
 stage you can choose a group of three 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.310
 characters and can control anyone 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.650
 of them at any moment exist as 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.720
 images and combat is more 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 complex than just squeezing the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.630
 button all the time it is possible to play with 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.630
 style 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.840
 outside the phases that do not involve 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.209
 You're going to have a good time at the gym. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.860
 the main city of rolling game 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.050
 history meets on ipc evolve 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.760
 characters and ex is also possible 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 visit other cities and explore a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.050
 map with the help of cuttlefish that can be 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.730
 raised on a farm is possible 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.130
 secondary missions for some 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.370
 ip6 in exchange for experience but the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.230
 The game's quest system is quite archaic and 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.480
 I say this because only possible 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.760
 meet a quest site every time 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.950
 even finding multiple site quest that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.470
 involve in the same city 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.180
 it is not possible to choose las is just one 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.010
 site quest every time and this in my 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.320
 opinion compromises how the game flows 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.640
 other things I did not like the game 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.530
 the exorbitant amount of kant is 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.440
 tired years ago of many casinos 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.750
 long and totally unnecessary 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.400
 in my opinion in the strong betinho 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.950
 czech jan 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.590
 but the worst part of the game with all 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.620
 sure is the camera brothers like 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.380
 This game's camera is terrible for a long time. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.230
 a lot of time even though he did not see a camera 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.370
 So bad the game she moves very fast 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.430
 if you lose constantly show angles 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.320
 unnecessary is a real mess 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.829
 but this is a result of this game being played 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.620
 originally released for pcs and then the 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.910
 transition did not go very well for 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.910
 the consoles of the current generation 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.700
 the game has about 18 hours without 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.260
 meet many website grows and it takes 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.660
 have my game twice so that the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.090
 history is completely complete 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.360
 The graphic is nice. The dubbing is good. 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.550
 music is great but there are 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.640
 structure of the game, especially in 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.500
 camera goes no fantasy type civil is not 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.830
 a game for any player like me 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.570
 said before but it's an interesting game 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.310
 different with a super cool fight 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.169
 that deserves a chance you're 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.960
 looking for a different rpg to 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.390
 play or if you are a fan of the series but if 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.789
 you just a curious I recommend to 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.430
 that you pass away from this game since 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.960
 there are better options for rpgs 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.000
 available in the market but these people 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.430
