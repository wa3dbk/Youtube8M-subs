00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
think it was anything I consciously set

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.550 
think it was anything I consciously set
out<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.460> seem<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.570> logical

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
out to do to seem like that a logical

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.310 
out to do to seem like that a logical
progression<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.400> I've<00:00:24.060> always<00:00:24.269> make<00:00:24.600> stupid

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
progression and I've always make stupid

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.759 
progression and I've always make stupid
videos<00:00:26.660> yeah<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> crack

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
videos yeah but we're gonna have a crack

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.280 
videos yeah but we're gonna have a crack
at<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.039> waiting<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.490> line<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> fact<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
at it waiting in line the fact that you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.520 
at it waiting in line the fact that you
can<00:00:37.550> sort<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> be<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> balcony<00:00:39.570> visually<00:00:40.379> as

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can sort of be a balcony visually as

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.619 
can sort of be a balcony visually as
well<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.760> orally<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.520> he's

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
well as like orally you know he's

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.660 
well as like orally you know he's
excited<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.260> me<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> guess<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:47.190> always<00:00:47.309> wanted

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
excited to me I guess I've always wanted

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
excited to me I guess I've always wanted
to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> control<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.500> think

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
to be out of the control that I think

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.939 
to be out of the control that I think
the<00:00:50.010> might<00:00:50.219> learn<00:00:50.520> about<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.949> I've

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the might learn about that is I've

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
the might learn about that is I've
always<00:00:53.250> wanted<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.789> plug<00:00:54.210> my<00:00:54.449> head<00:00:54.750> into

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
always wanted to plug my head into

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
always wanted to plug my head into
someone<00:00:55.440> else's<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.789> while<00:00:57.449> I'm

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
someone else's so they can see while I'm

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.010 
someone else's so they can see while I'm
imagining<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.230> head

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.350 

juxtaposition<00:01:03.020> just<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.070> concept<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.820> two

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360

about I think the music to me dictated

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.449 
about I think the music to me dictated
what<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> clip<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.740> be<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:18.190> what<00:02:18.430> I

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
what the clip is going to be like what I

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.630 
what the clip is going to be like what I
listen<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.450> song<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.230> just<00:02:20.680> imagined<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
listen to that song I just imagined a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.990 
listen to that song I just imagined a
different<00:02:22.470> well<00:02:23.470> Samba<00:02:23.890> was<00:02:23.950> playing<00:02:24.370> those

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
different well Samba was playing those

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.620 
different well Samba was playing those
parts<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.740> did<00:02:26.860> was<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.400> went<00:02:27.940> around<00:02:28.150> on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
parts so what I did was I went around on

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.800 
parts so what I did was I went around on
YouTube<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.260> collected<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.010> whole<00:02:30.190> bunch<00:02:30.520> of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
YouTube and collected a whole bunch of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
YouTube and collected a whole bunch of
clips<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.170> thought<00:02:32.440> represented<00:02:33.220> that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
clips that I thought represented that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.640 
clips that I thought represented that
genre<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.600> cut<00:02:34.900> together<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
genre and then I cut together a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830 
genre and then I cut together a
treatment<00:02:36.340> clip<00:02:36.640> out<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:37.060> other<00:02:37.209> footage

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
treatment clip out of other footage

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.410 
treatment clip out of other footage

then I imagined that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.350 
then I imagined that
in<00:02:55.340> Beijing<00:02:55.790> with<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.920> know<00:02:58.120> not<00:02:59.120> so

connection<00:03:03.950> how<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.520> happened<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.060> because

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
connection how it happened but because

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.650 
connection how it happened but because
maybe<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.680> was<00:03:06.860> stuck<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.459> up-tempo<00:03:08.000> rift

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
maybe it was stuck the up-tempo rift

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.650 
maybe it was stuck the up-tempo rift
before<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.230> reminded<00:03:09.590> me<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:10.580> BPM<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.300> like

the<00:04:22.049> internet<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:22.740> because<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.220> doesn't

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the internet it's because it doesn't

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.130 
the internet it's because it doesn't
count<00:04:23.910> for<00:04:24.030> something<00:04:24.450> which<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.870> think's

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
count for something which I think's

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.410 
count for something which I think's
wrong<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.580> thought<00:04:26.850> it'd<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.090> kind<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.360> cool

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
wrong so I thought it'd be kind of cool

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.600 
wrong so I thought it'd be kind of cool
to<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.710> pits<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.370> I've<00:04:29.460> been<00:04:29.490> a
