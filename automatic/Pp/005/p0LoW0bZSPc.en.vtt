00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.000
ALMOND COOKIES

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.609
Hello! I am pleased to welcome you at my kitchen!

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:18.070
It is always nice to please the children with homemade biscuits.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.380
I offer you a recipe of delicious homemade almond cookies.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.480
It is very easy to cook it!

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.099
For this recipe we need:

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.569
almond flour, which can be done by grinding almonds,

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.280
powdered sugar (I use fructose)

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.250
and one egg.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.810
That's all we need.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.190
Take the whisking container.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.960
Divide here one egg.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.960
Pour fructose.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.070
Take a mixer with "whisk" blade.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.000
You can use blade "beater".

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.090
Beat eggs with fructose.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.900
Enough.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.200
Beat until the sugar (or fructose) is completely mixed with egg.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:58.270
Take bowl. Pour egg here with fructose.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.070
Add the almond flour.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.070
Knead the dough.

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.789
The dough is ready.

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.700
Now take an oven tray.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.400
Cover it with parchment paper.

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:36.369
Smear hands a little with vegetable oil.

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.779
Take the dough.

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.659
Roll out of it small balls the size of a walnut.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.289
You can put the nut (almond, walnut) in the middle of it.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:53.200
Sprinkle with powdered sugar.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.800
Spread on parchment paper.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.300
Put the cookies to bake in a preheated 160 Â°C oven.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.900
It took 20 minutes. Cookies are ready.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.000
Take it out from the oven and leave to cool.

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:28.699
With a light crust on the outside, soft inside - it is perfect dessert for tea and coffee.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.200
Bon Appetite!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.000
