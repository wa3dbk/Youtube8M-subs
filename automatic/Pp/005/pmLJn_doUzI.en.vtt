shoulder away from the defense the next

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.889 
shoulder away from the defense the next
step<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:31.039> to<00:01:31.280> jump<00:01:31.550> in<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.820> air<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.240> raise<00:01:32.660> the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899

index finger and you should have a

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.990 
index finger and you should have a
similar<00:02:00.439> follow-through<00:02:01.340> where<00:02:01.549> your<00:02:01.670> elbow

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
similar follow-through where your elbow

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.330 
similar follow-through where your elbow
extends<00:02:02.659> hold<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.500> follow-through<00:02:03.920> just

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
extends hold that follow-through just

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.999 
extends hold that follow-through just
like<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> jump<00:02:04.820> shot<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.530> see<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> couple

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
like a jump shot you can see a couple

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.520 
like a jump shot you can see a couple
examples<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:07.810> with<00:02:08.810> everything<00:02:09.290> put

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
examples here with everything put

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530 
examples here with everything put
together<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.250> ball<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.880> outside<00:02:11.269> shoulder

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
together so ball to the outside shoulder

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.319 
together so ball to the outside shoulder
high<00:02:11.930> release<00:02:12.230> point<00:02:12.620> snap<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.489> wrist<00:02:14.000> over

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
high release point snap the wrist over

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.990 
high release point snap the wrist over
and<00:02:14.780> drive<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.560> index<00:02:15.950> finger<00:02:16.070> there's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and drive with that index finger there's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.509 
and drive with that index finger there's
another<00:02:17.269> angle<00:02:17.739> here<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> side<00:02:19.280> by<00:02:19.489> side

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
another angle here is a side by side

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.030 
another angle here is a side by side
look<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.510> jump<00:02:20.810> hook<00:02:20.989> versus<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> jump<00:02:21.799> shot

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
look at a jump hook versus a jump shot

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.009 
look at a jump hook versus a jump shot
right<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.519> paint<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.660> see<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
right in the paint and you can see the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.259 
right in the paint and you can see the
difference<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.620> where<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.920> ball<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.760> if

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
difference in where the ball is and if

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.940 
difference in where the ball is and if
you<00:02:26.420> were<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.660> look<00:02:26.870> at<00:02:27.019> them<00:02:27.260> above<00:02:27.769> each

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you were to look at them above each

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.100 
you were to look at them above each
other<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.610> pretend<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.600> top<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.870> that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
other and pretend that the top of that

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.130 
other and pretend that the top of that
red<00:02:30.380> line<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.160> defenders<00:02:31.820> hand<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.959> see

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
red line is a defenders hand you can see

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.930 
red line is a defenders hand you can see
how<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.470> shot<00:02:33.829> would<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.190> blocked<00:02:34.549> on<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
how that shot would get blocked on a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.720 
how that shot would get blocked on a
jump<00:02:35.329> shot<00:02:35.600> but<00:02:36.320> on<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> jump<00:02:36.890> hook<00:02:37.100> you're

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
jump shot but on the jump hook you're

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.430 
jump shot but on the jump hook you're
gonna<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:38.060> able<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.269> get<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.660> shot<00:02:38.989> up<00:02:39.230> over

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
gonna be able to get that shot up over

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna be able to get that shot up over
the<00:02:40.130> defender

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.820 

so<00:02:52.480> that's<00:02:52.660> all<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> information<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.650> should

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
so that's all the information you should

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.680 
so that's all the information you should
need<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.070> take<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.670> jump<00:02:54.880> hook<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.360> learn<00:02:55.540> it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
need to take the jump hook and learn it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.870 
need to take the jump hook and learn it
this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.530> great<00:02:56.920> move<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.640> said

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
this is a great move like I said

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.790 
this is a great move like I said
everybody<00:02:58.450> needs<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.900> develop<00:02:59.320> this<00:02:59.470> move

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
everybody needs to develop this move

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.230 
everybody needs to develop this move
because<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> finish<00:03:00.760> inside

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
because you can finish inside

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.810 
because you can finish inside
effectively<00:03:01.990> with<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.950> start<00:03:03.280> working<00:03:03.670> on

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
effectively with it so start working on

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.730 
effectively with it so start working on
it<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.210> it<00:03:04.330> done<00:03:04.510> leave<00:03:04.960> questions<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
it get it done leave questions in the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.390 
it get it done leave questions in the
comments<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.370> be<00:03:06.430> sure<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:06.670> like<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.090> video
