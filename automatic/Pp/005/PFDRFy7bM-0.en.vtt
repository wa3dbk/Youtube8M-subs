bright<00:01:44.610> red<00:01:44.970> lip<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.110> like

bright red lip look that is just like
really<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.899> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
really really going for it and my way of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.719 
really really going for it and my way of
doing<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> way<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> sort<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.549> feel

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
doing that in a way that I sort of feel

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.700 
doing that in a way that I sort of feel
safe<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.390> wear<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:52.380> throughout

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
safe will wear really well throughout

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
safe will wear really well throughout
the<00:01:52.860> day<00:01:52.979> without<00:01:53.130> looking<00:01:53.640> messy<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.570> being

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the day without looking messy or being

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
the day without looking messy or being
something<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> worry<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.460> doing

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
something I need to worry about is doing

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.929 
something I need to worry about is doing
a<00:01:57.450> lip<00:01:57.750> liner<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.380> lip<00:01:58.950> balm<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> feel<00:01:59.759> like

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
a lip liner and lip balm and I feel like

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.870 
a lip liner and lip balm and I feel like
lip<00:02:00.659> liners<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.200> gotten<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> bad<00:02:01.920> rep<00:02:02.490> like

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
lip liners have gotten a bad rep like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.179 
lip liners have gotten a bad rep like
both<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> 80s<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.530> because<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
both in the 80s and now because in the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
both in the 80s and now because in the
80s<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.700> people<00:02:06.119> wore<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
80s like people wore like just the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.800 
80s like people wore like just the
outline<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.280> looks<00:02:08.580> terrible<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.300> then

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
outline and that looks terrible and then

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
outline and that looks terrible and then
now<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.500> being<00:02:10.739> overused<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.489> kind<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
now it's just being overused to kind of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.000 
now it's just being overused to kind of
create<00:02:12.030> those<00:02:12.390> horrible<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.470> fish<00:02:13.680> lips

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
create those horrible kind of fish lips

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.550 
create those horrible kind of fish lips
that<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> can't<00:02:14.640> stand<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.200> use<00:02:16.440> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
that I can't stand but if you use it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.170 
that I can't stand but if you use it
like<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.739> normal<00:02:16.830> person<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.910> stick

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
like a normal person and you stick

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.869 
like a normal person and you stick
within<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.660> lip<00:02:18.870> line<00:02:19.110> or<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:20.430> over

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
within your lip line or just just over

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.229 
within your lip line or just just over
it

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
it

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.540 
it
and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.080> fill<00:02:22.319> your<00:02:22.500> lips<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.040> use<00:02:23.400> it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
and then fill your lips and use it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.820 
and then fill your lips and use it
basically<00:02:24.000> exactly<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.900> lipstick<00:02:25.349> it's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
basically exactly like a lipstick it's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830 
basically exactly like a lipstick it's
actually<00:02:26.280> such<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> great<00:02:27.150> tool<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.690> creating

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
actually such a great tool for creating

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually such a great tool for creating
a<00:02:28.319> red<00:02:28.560> lip<00:02:28.800> look<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> hourglass

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
a red lip look so this is the hourglass

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.530 
a red lip look so this is the hourglass
panoramic<00:02:31.140> lip<00:02:31.800> liner<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.400> icon<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.269> think<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
panoramic lip liner in icon I think the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.330 
panoramic lip liner in icon I think the
hourglass<00:02:34.170> ones<00:02:34.410> are<00:02:34.560> really<00:02:34.769> great<00:02:35.099> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
hourglass ones are really great and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.190 
hourglass ones are really great and
creamy<00:02:35.760> they're<00:02:36.120> less<00:02:36.330> expensive<00:02:36.480> than<00:02:37.080> their

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
creamy they're less expensive than their

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.530 
creamy they're less expensive than their
lipsticks<00:02:37.739> still<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> pricey<00:02:38.790> choice

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
lipsticks still a pricey choice

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
lipsticks still a pricey choice
but<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.379> find<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.069> it's<00:02:41.310> worth<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.940> lip

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
but I find that it's worth it for a lip

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.850 
but I find that it's worth it for a lip
liner<00:02:42.330> because<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.349> be<00:02:43.530> really

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
liner because you want it to be really

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
liner because you want it to be really
creamy<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.730> overly<00:02:45.150> drying<00:02:45.690> although

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
creamy and not overly drying although

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.619 
creamy and not overly drying although
this<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.680> definitely<00:02:46.950> more<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:48.300> matte

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
this one is definitely more of a matte

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.479 
this one is definitely more of a matte
look<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.140> really<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> comes<00:02:50.129> with<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
look I really like that it comes with a

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.630 
look I really like that it comes with a
brush<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.030> well<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> other<00:02:51.959> side<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.890> what

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
brush as well on the other side and what

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.610 
brush as well on the other side and what
I<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.180> sort<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.660> make<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.930> more<00:02:55.230> comfortable

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
I do to sort of make it more comfortable

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.190 
I do to sort of make it more comfortable
and<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.459> more<00:02:56.730> shiny<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.480> less<00:02:57.720> matte

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and a little more shiny and less matte

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.649 
and a little more shiny and less matte
is<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.920> use<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> lip<00:02:59.340> balm<00:02:59.489> over<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.450> use

this is why sells woosh Pikachu and the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
this is why sells woosh Pikachu and the
color<00:05:05.979> of<00:05:06.279> for<00:05:06.639> definitely<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.419> more<00:05:07.689> expensive

pick but I think it's a really good pick
