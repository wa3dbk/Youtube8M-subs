video you saw me building quadrant 3

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.679 
video you saw me building quadrant 3
which<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.270> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> honestly

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
which is this one and this is honestly

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
finished now you saw me putting down the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
finished now you saw me putting down the
framework<00:00:24.260> so<00:00:25.260> that's<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> shape<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:27.680> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
framework so that's the shape of it and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.020 
framework so that's the shape of it and
the<00:00:29.490> back<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.510> here<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.030> run

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the back and just go down here and run

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
the back and just go down here and run
through<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.350> bet<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> saw<00:00:38.070> me

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
through this is the bet you saw me

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.680 
through this is the bet you saw me
building<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> you've<00:00:41.579> got<00:00:41.760> big<00:00:42.120> room<00:00:42.360> here

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
building so you've got big room here

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
building so you've got big room here
some<00:00:43.440> patches<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> ceiling<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.579> that's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
some patches in the ceiling but that's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.590 
some patches in the ceiling but that's
fine<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:46.399> this<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.610> probably<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.969> split<00:00:48.570> up

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
fine and this will probably be split up

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.080 
fine and this will probably be split up
into<00:00:50.329> individual<00:00:51.329> rooms<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> can

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
into individual rooms and then we can

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.549 
into individual rooms and then we can
come<00:00:54.210> through<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> back

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
come through here and there's the back

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
come through here and there's the back
and<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> back<00:00:59.820> has<00:01:00.000> lots<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> doorways

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and the back has lots of doorways

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:10.730 
and the back has lots of doorways
leading<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.409> walkways<00:01:09.740> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
leading up to these little walkways so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.850 
leading up to these little walkways so
from<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> places<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.960> hear<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
from most of the places and hear the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
from most of the places and hear the
water<00:01:14.159> dripping<00:01:14.610> through<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
water dripping through you can get to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.910 
water dripping through you can get to
the<00:01:16.770> other<00:01:16.920> flaws<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.470> run<00:01:19.470> around<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the other flaws and run around and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.570 
the other flaws and run around and
explore<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.490> stuff<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.340> goes<00:01:26.340> up
