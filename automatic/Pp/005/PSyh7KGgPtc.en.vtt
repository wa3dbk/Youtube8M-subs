00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.370 

another<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:06.960> box<00:02:07.170> is

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
just the sort of quick sort of guide of

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.300 
just the sort of quick sort of guide of
how<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.630> basically<00:02:09.960> install<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.950> motion

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
how you basically install the motion

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.770 
how you basically install the motion
controller<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.820> navigation<00:02:12.480> controller

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
controller and navigation controller

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:25.130 
controller and navigation controller
into<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> actual<00:02:13.890> gun<00:02:14.070> itself<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:24.960> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
into the actual gun itself so this is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.380 
into the actual gun itself so this is
the<00:02:25.320> main<00:02:25.710> body<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.270> actually

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the main body of it so you can actually

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.810 
the main body of it so you can actually
leave<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.200> type<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> mode<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.040> have

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
leave it in this type of mode and have

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.430 
leave it in this type of mode and have
it<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.030> what's<00:02:30.360> called<00:02:30.630> easy<00:02:31.050> mode<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
it in what's called easy mode that a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.950 
it in what's called easy mode that a
showcased<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> box<00:02:32.490> itself<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.750> I'll<00:02:33.810> just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
showcased on the box itself so I'll just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.750 
showcased on the box itself so I'll just
install<00:02:34.140> basically<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.220> PlayStation<00:02:35.730> Move

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
install basically the PlayStation Move

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.280 
install basically the PlayStation Move
controllers<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.480> show<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.960> what<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.140> looks

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
controllers and show you what it looks

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.180 
controllers and show you what it looks
like<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.860> not<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.160> iron<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:40.190> navigation

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
like just not to iron so your navigation

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.770 
like just not to iron so your navigation
controller<00:02:41.490> goes<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.940> back<00:02:42.120> part<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.630> in

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
controller goes in the back part here in

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.620 
controller goes in the back part here in
the<00:02:42.990> handle<00:02:43.410> area

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the handle area

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.810 
the handle area
let's<00:02:45.630> go<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> line<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.820> then<00:02:48.090> clip<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.330> in

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
let's go to line it and then clip it in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.240 
let's go to line it and then clip it in
and<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.870> will<00:02:52.020> fit<00:02:52.260> pretty<00:02:52.500> tight<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:52.860> there

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and it will fit pretty tight in there

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.670 
and it will fit pretty tight in there
which<00:02:53.730> is<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.210> want<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.360> see

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
which is what you want so as you can see

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.170 
which is what you want so as you can see
it's<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:58.800> clip<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.410> go

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
it's not clip there we go

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.850 
it's not clip there we go
as<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.300> can<00:03:03.360> see<00:03:03.510> if<00:03:03.600> it's<00:03:03.750> quite<00:03:03.959> snug<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
as you can see if it's quite snug you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.780 
as you can see if it's quite snug you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
controller that goes in the front here

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.900 
controller that goes in the front here
in<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.480> barrel<00:03:22.810> section<00:03:23.230> it's<00:03:24.190> all<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.430> do<00:03:24.640> is

he's got two black clips on either side
you<00:03:27.010> push<00:03:27.489> them<00:03:27.700> down<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.239> that<00:03:28.959> clips<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.440> and

you push them down and that clips up and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.000 
you push them down and that clips up and
then<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.209> slide<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.690> in<00:03:31.870> now<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.680> be<00:03:32.920> your

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
then you slide this in now to be your

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.589 
then you slide this in now to be your
eyes<00:03:33.129> if<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.430> do<00:03:33.610> have<00:03:33.819> like<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> wrist<00:03:34.450> strap

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
eyes if you do have like a wrist strap

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.350 
eyes if you do have like a wrist strap
on<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.049> end<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.290> this<00:03:36.060> sometimes<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.269> will

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
on the end of this sometimes it will

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.640 
on the end of this sometimes it will
actually<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.780> court<00:03:38.080> in<00:03:38.170> hand<00:03:38.440> won't<00:03:38.560> fit

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
actually a court in hand won't fit

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.289 
actually a court in hand won't fit
properly<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.670> you're<00:03:39.819> going<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.000> install

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
properly so you're going to install

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.699 
properly so you're going to install
since<00:03:40.569> your<00:03:40.690> gun<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.049> may<00:03:41.170> not<00:03:41.349> just<00:03:41.500> remove

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
since your gun you may not just remove

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.339 
since your gun you may not just remove
your<00:03:41.830> wrist<00:03:42.190> up<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:42.790> what<00:03:42.910> I've<00:03:43.000> done

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
your wrist up and that's what I've done

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.509 
your wrist up and that's what I've done
because<00:03:44.349> it<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.590> makes<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.980> lot<00:03:45.069> easier<00:03:45.250> to

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
because it just makes it a lot easier to

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.759 
because it just makes it a lot easier to
place<00:03:45.940> inside<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.420> gun<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:47.349> that<00:03:47.379> just<00:03:47.620> clips

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
place inside the gun so that just clips

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.330 
place inside the gun so that just clips
in<00:03:47.920> there<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.329> sucks<00:03:49.599> like<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.340> and

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
in there and that sucks like that and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.710 
in there and that sucks like that and
you<00:03:51.430> can<00:03:51.579> see<00:03:51.730> still<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.239> still<00:03:52.360> get<00:03:52.599> all

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720

you can see still you can still get all
your<00:03:53.079> buttons<00:03:53.410> yeah<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.549> benefit<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.030> on

aim

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.860 

so<00:04:25.889> on<00:04:26.070> its<00:04:26.250> own<00:04:26.460> that's<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.120> easy<00:04:27.419> mode<00:04:27.600> looks

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
so on its own that's the easy mode looks

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.140 
so on its own that's the easy mode looks
pretty<00:04:28.139> cool<00:04:28.290> anyway<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.759> just<00:04:29.910> wanted

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
pretty cool anyway so if you just wanted

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.670 
pretty cool anyway so if you just wanted
something<00:04:30.330> simple<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:31.050> that's<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.350> way<00:04:31.470> go

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
something simple and that's the way go

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.159 
something simple and that's the way go
but<00:04:32.520> say<00:04:32.729> you<00:04:32.790> do<00:04:33.300> want<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.600> adjust<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.050> you

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
but say you do want to adjust and you

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.469 
but say you do want to adjust and you
want<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> scope<00:04:34.919> and<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.340> stock<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.759> well

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
want the scope and the stock on well

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.450 
want the scope and the stock on well
then<00:04:36.570> that's<00:04:36.810> easy<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.800> actual<00:04:38.220> scope

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
then that's easy so the actual scope

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.320 
then that's easy so the actual scope
itself<00:04:44.389> so<00:04:45.389> this<00:04:45.660> is<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> scope<00:04:46.259> that

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
itself so this is the scope that

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.590 
itself so this is the scope that
Chansey

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.500 

you<00:04:52.140> can<00:04:52.320> see<00:04:52.590> it's<00:04:53.160> got<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.520> your<00:04:53.760> crosshair

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
you can see it's got like your crosshair

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.370 
you can see it's got like your crosshair
on<00:04:54.540> it

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.920 

basically<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:01.580> goes<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.120> way<00:05:02.330> either<00:05:02.600> some

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
basically this goes this way either some

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.140 
basically this goes this way either some
way<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.260> is<00:05:03.410> basically<00:05:03.770> towards<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.400> are<00:05:05.030> you

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
way and is basically towards you are you

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.850 
way and is basically towards you are you
lining<00:05:05.390> up<00:05:05.660> with<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:05.960> grooves<00:05:06.230> on<00:05:06.410> top<00:05:06.590> there

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
lining up with the grooves on top there

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.270 
lining up with the grooves on top there
and<00:05:07.960> then<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.080> pull<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.380> back<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.890> it<00:05:10.070> clips

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
and then you pull it back and it clips

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.830 
and then you pull it back and it clips
into<00:05:10.520> place<00:05:12.100> like<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.390> so<00:05:14.390> that's<00:05:14.540> got<00:05:14.690> your

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
into place like that so that's got your

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.050 
into place like that so that's got your
scope<00:05:15.110> installed<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.430> other<00:05:16.610> part<00:05:16.850> is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
scope installed and the other part is

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.560 
scope installed and the other part is
your<00:05:17.270> stock<00:05:21.640> which<00:05:22.640> basically<00:05:23.060> clips<00:05:23.390> the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
your stock which basically clips the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.710 
your stock which basically clips the
back<00:05:23.750> here<00:05:23.960> just<00:05:24.830> slides<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.670> clips<00:05:26.510> in

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
back here just slides in and clips in

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.260 
back here just slides in and clips in
there<00:05:26.980> so<00:05:27.980> now<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.850> have<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.170> submachine<00:05:30.170> gun

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
there so now you have a submachine gun

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.700 
there so now you have a submachine gun
so<00:05:32.270> this<00:05:32.390> is<00:05:32.510> can<00:05:32.600> easily<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.260> part<00:05:33.560> can<00:05:33.650> go

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
so this is can easily that part can go

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.740 
so this is can easily that part can go
in<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.250> your<00:05:34.280> shoulder<00:05:34.730> area<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.150> then<00:05:35.660> you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
in to your shoulder area and then you

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.790 
in to your shoulder area and then you
can<00:05:35.930> look<00:05:36.110> through<00:05:36.500> your<00:05:36.740> sights<00:05:37.040> as<00:05:38.800> quite

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
can look through your sights as quite

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.310 
can look through your sights as quite
comfortable<00:05:40.250> hold<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.750> personally<00:05:41.750> prefer<00:05:42.140> it

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
comfortable hold I personally prefer it

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.260 
comfortable hold I personally prefer it
in<00:05:42.440> your<00:05:42.710> submachine<00:05:43.280> gun<00:05:43.550> kind<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:43.910> look

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
in your submachine gun kind of look

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.270 
in your submachine gun kind of look
because<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.110> looks<00:05:45.290> a<00:05:45.380> lot<00:05:45.530> better<00:05:45.590> like<00:05:46.040> this

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
because it looks a lot better like this

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.790 
because it looks a lot better like this

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
know if you can see it it makes

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.580 
know if you can see it it makes
everything<00:06:05.450> sort<00:06:05.780> of<00:06:05.810> green<00:06:06.080> when<00:06:06.350> you<00:06:06.440> look

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
everything sort of green when you look

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.130 
everything sort of green when you look
through<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:08.030> is<00:06:08.150> clear<00:06:08.450> but<00:06:08.750> it<00:06:08.900> doesn't

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
through it it is clear but it doesn't

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.480 
through it it is clear but it doesn't
really<00:06:09.230> benefit<00:06:09.650> you<00:06:09.770> too<00:06:09.950> much<00:06:10.100> between<00:06:10.310> the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
really benefit you too much between the

really benefit you too much between the
game<00:06:10.670> you're<00:06:11.150> probably<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.450> better<00:06:11.660> off

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
game you're probably just better off

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720 
game you're probably just better off
just<00:06:11.900> aiming<00:06:12.170> as<00:06:12.410> normal<00:06:12.800> and<00:06:13.130> shooting<00:06:13.610> or

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
just aiming as normal and shooting or

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.060 
just aiming as normal and shooting or
even<00:06:13.970> removing<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.450> stock<00:06:14.630> completely<00:06:15.170> but

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
even removing the stock completely but

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.400 
even removing the stock completely but
that<00:06:16.160> is<00:06:16.280> really<00:06:16.490> personal<00:06:16.940> preference

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
that is really personal preference

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.470 
that is really personal preference
but<00:06:18.800> as<00:06:18.920> a<00:06:18.950> basically<00:06:19.730> shooting<00:06:19.970> attachment

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
but as a basically shooting attachment

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.210 
but as a basically shooting attachment
does<00:06:20.630> make<00:06:20.810> it<00:06:20.960> look<00:06:21.110> a<00:06:21.170> bit<00:06:21.200> different<00:06:21.560> this

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
does make it look a bit different this

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.670 
does make it look a bit different this
is<00:06:22.400> like<00:06:22.580> your<00:06:22.790> standard<00:06:22.970> shot<00:06:23.360> shooter<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:24.470> if

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
is like your standard shot shooter so if

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.990 
is like your standard shot shooter so if
you<00:06:24.800> wanted<00:06:25.130> something<00:06:25.340> a<00:06:25.490> bit<00:06:25.610> different<00:06:25.940> in

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
you wanted something a bit different in

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
you wanted something a bit different in
the<00:06:26.060> sharp<00:06:26.300> shooter<00:06:26.570> then<00:06:26.690> something<00:06:26.990> like

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
the sharp shooter then something like

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.290 
the sharp shooter then something like
this<00:06:27.110> would<00:06:27.440> probably<00:06:27.590> be<00:06:28.220> the<00:06:28.610> way<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:28.760> go<00:06:29.030> and

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
this would probably be the way to go and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.970 
this would probably be the way to go and
also<00:06:29.810> this<00:06:29.870> is<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.020> lot<00:06:30.260> cheaper<00:06:30.530> than<00:06:30.740> your

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
also this is a lot cheaper than your

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.190 
also this is a lot cheaper than your
sharpshooter<00:06:31.520> sharpshooter<00:06:32.200> generally

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
sharpshooter sharpshooter generally

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.050 
sharpshooter sharpshooter generally
because<00:06:33.410> they're<00:06:33.530> official<00:06:33.920> Sony<00:06:34.160> they<00:06:34.850> can

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
because they're official Sony they can

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.540 
because they're official Sony they can
be<00:06:35.180> more<00:06:35.390> expensive<00:06:35.720> while<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.590> CTA<00:06:36.920> ones<00:06:37.280> are

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
be more expensive while the CTA ones are

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.060 
be more expensive while the CTA ones are
a<00:06:37.580> lot<00:06:38.000> cheaper<00:06:38.350> now<00:06:39.350> this<00:06:39.500> is<00:06:39.710> just<00:06:39.920> an

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
a lot cheaper now this is just an

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.520 
a lot cheaper now this is just an
attachment<00:06:40.340> or<00:06:40.730> a<00:06:40.760> shell<00:06:41.120> so<00:06:41.840> that's<00:06:42.020> why<00:06:42.260> it's

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
attachment or a shell so that's why it's

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.080 
attachment or a shell so that's why it's
cheaper<00:06:42.980> it<00:06:43.160> is<00:06:43.190> pretty<00:06:43.550> much<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.670> plastic

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
cheaper it is pretty much a plastic

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.330 
cheaper it is pretty much a plastic
shell<00:06:44.270> but<00:06:44.930> it<00:06:45.050> makes<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:45.470> so<00:06:45.530> much<00:06:45.740> better<00:06:46.040> to

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
shell but it makes it so much better to

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.190 
shell but it makes it so much better to
actually<00:06:46.520> play<00:06:47.180> shooters<00:06:47.780> with<00:06:48.050> the

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
actually play shooters with the

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.250 
actually play shooters with the
PlayStation<00:06:48.710> 3<00:06:49.060> so<00:06:50.060> I'd<00:06:50.210> recommend<00:06:50.420> using<00:06:50.960> if

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.260 
PlayStation 3 so I'd recommend using if

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.840 
PlayStation 3 so I'd recommend using if
you<00:06:51.410> are<00:06:51.560> going<00:06:51.680> to<00:06:51.770> be<00:06:51.860> playing<00:06:52.160> with<00:06:52.730> the

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
you are going to be playing with the

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.700 
you are going to be playing with the
move<00:06:53.000> controllers<00:06:53.510> with<00:06:53.720> shooters<00:06:54.080> or<00:06:54.350> on<00:06:54.590> the

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
move controllers with shooters or on the

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.770 
move controllers with shooters or on the
rails<00:06:54.950> or<00:06:55.190> anything<00:06:55.340> like<00:06:55.520> this<00:06:55.730> get<00:06:56.480> some

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
rails or anything like this get some

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.480 
rails or anything like this get some
kind<00:06:57.050> of<00:06:57.140> a<00:06:57.260> gun<00:06:57.440> attachment<00:06:58.010> this<00:06:58.220> is<00:06:58.340> just

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490
