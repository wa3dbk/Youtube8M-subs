00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
 and another two and a half dozen military 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.029
 parts and educational institutions this year 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.589
 the number of participants is more than 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.589
 usually by tradition opens marata 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.610
 orchestra of pupils 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 Suvorov schools 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.429
 one of the most spectacular moments 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.499
 parade of performance by all participants 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.660
 Russian anthem grand tour 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.460
 thousands of votes stretched to hundreds 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.980
 meters 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 the exit of the edge to the edge of the plaza takes seconds 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 the delay is why the Spaniards have to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.449
 rely not only on words but also on 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.039
 vision 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 because each of his second round is different 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 there is a conductor of dump trucks 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.430
 if you look at it and more 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.950
 at rehearsal the criminal minister 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 Defense Anatoly Serdyukov 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.790
 May ninth rub 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.660
 first time taking parade today 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.880
 watches what's happening with 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.970
 stands in general and everything passes 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.440
 smoothly there are certain moments 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.990
 requiring grinding will continue to work 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.870
 what is called with a margin because he 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.230
 real parade everything will be harder red 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.240
 the square reports a typo identified 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.220
 so Iâ€™m a member of post parades 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.870
 several had to go myself 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.020
 to plots and red square 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.730
 the atmosphere which is so 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.770
 one pulls or cares a little 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.640
 here are some of the calmer guys 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 the capital 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.290
 aerobatic team Swifts General 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.830
 run flights are still to come 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.070

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.080
 absolutely right they had a half year flight 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 back after such a break 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.980
 field as part of childhood lisovolik 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.359

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.710
 good weather 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.100
 I wonder what if taxed 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 you are planning a distance city 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.060
 cheese consumption news is for us not 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 so important made with vitalis looked 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.040
 at each other everything 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.640
 The third in the history of meetings and the schedule is very 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 tight schedule is a great honor not 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.990
 less interest 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630
 distance between the machines in flight 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.759
 sometimes less than one body each 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.770
 citizen of law enforcement 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.300
