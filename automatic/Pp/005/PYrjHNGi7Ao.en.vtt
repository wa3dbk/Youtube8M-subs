00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.420
 I did not ride for a while today gn 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:27.920
 I'm going to start the engine 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.920

 Government is not good 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 I think I'm going to go out 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.480
 Before going push 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.390
 The first thing to check is the kill switch 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.880
 Kill switch is high 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.800
 Is this condition ? 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.390
 After the plug cap 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.210
 Is it stabbed properly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.210
 It is a man's gasoline or does it contain a thermoplastic ring 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.730
 I am 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.980
 It is relatively good to take this engine 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.210
 I think I should buy it or not 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.210
 I will try one challenge 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.079

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.260
 Other action camera 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.650
 I respected 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:17.870

 Hmm 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.640

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.930

 And the key to the on 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Put the gear to 3 per foot observation 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.100
 Oxygen luck 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.440
 This is the beginning of the push, so if you go to the speed of a certain number of minutes to paint the Kurachi 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.490
 I can connect in half 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.860

 There was one shot 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.050
 I think this bike is originally starting 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:55.980
 Well compared to storage bike maybe 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.980
