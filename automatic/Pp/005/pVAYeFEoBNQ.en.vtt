spider-man<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.839> not<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> regular

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
spider-man so this is not the regular

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.260

the<00:00:27.090> back<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.760> what<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> could<00:00:30.689> see

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the back you see that what I could see

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.240 
the back you see that what I could see
from<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> figure<00:00:31.470> though<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.009> very

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
from the figure though it's not very

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.080 
from the figure though it's not very
posable<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:34.020> doesn't<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.410> too<00:00:34.800> many<00:00:35.090> joints

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
posable it doesn't have too many joints

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.069 
posable it doesn't have too many joints
but<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> has<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> cool<00:00:37.460> base<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.450> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
but it has a cool base and a back I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.150 
but it has a cool base and a back I
guess<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> background

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
wrist may be a little bit but other than

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.479

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
that like you like right here I don't

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.090 
that like you like right here I don't
know<00:03:22.640> why<00:03:22.760> they<00:03:22.880> do<00:03:22.940> joints<00:03:23.630> like<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
know why they do joints like this so it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.300 
know why they do joints like this so it
looks<00:03:25.250> crappy<00:03:25.720> see<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.200> little<00:03:28.010> John's

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
looks crappy see that a little John's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.050 
looks crappy see that a little John's
already<00:03:28.640> lost<00:03:28.820> interest<00:03:30.489> all<00:03:31.489> right<00:03:31.700> another

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
already lost interest all right another

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.710 
already lost interest all right another
thing<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:33.910> okay<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.030> you're<00:03:35.150> gonna<00:03:35.269> put<00:03:35.600> it

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
thing is okay if you're gonna put it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.890 
thing is okay if you're gonna put it
somewhere<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.340> make<00:03:37.489> sure<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.030> you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
somewhere you have to make sure you you

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.630 
somewhere you have to make sure you you
know<00:03:38.989> make<00:03:39.320> sure<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:40.030> very<00:03:41.030> well<00:03:41.540> placed

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
know make sure this is very well placed

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.900 
know make sure this is very well placed
because<00:03:43.640> there<00:03:44.000> are<00:03:44.120> no<00:03:44.360> little<00:03:44.750> feet<00:03:45.019> things

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
because there are no little feet things

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.930 
because there are no little feet things
to<00:03:46.910> stick<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.220> basically<00:03:49.459> have<00:03:49.790> a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
to stick it in so you basically have a

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.640 
to stick it in so you basically have a
freedom<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.570> putting<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.989> wherever<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.380> want

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
freedom of putting it wherever you want

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.009 
freedom of putting it wherever you want
but<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:53.209> could<00:03:53.450> risk<00:03:54.200> falling<00:03:54.890> all<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.040> time

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
but you could risk falling all the time

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.390 
but you could risk falling all the time
the<00:03:57.019> same<00:03:57.200> thing<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.620> these<00:03:57.739> guys<00:03:58.010> here
