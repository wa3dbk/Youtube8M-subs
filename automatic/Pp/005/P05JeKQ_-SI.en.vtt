I found this fix on the steam forums and
I'm<00:00:28.769> pretty<00:00:29.039> sure<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.519> might<00:00:29.699> work<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.970> origin

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
I'm pretty sure it might work for origin

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.970 
I'm pretty sure it might work for origin
but<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:33.020> because<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.829> bin

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but I because it has to do with the bin

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.340 
but I because it has to do with the bin

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.820 
take everything that's in the 64-bit
copy<00:02:41.880> copy<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.330> paste<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.960> into<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.320> new<00:02:44.590> folder

copy copy and paste it into a new folder
which<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.880> already<00:02:45.970> did<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:47.310> rename<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.340> rename

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
which I already did and rename it rename

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.920 
which I already did and rename it rename
the<00:02:49.120> old<00:02:49.300> one<00:02:50.130> then<00:02:51.130> thirty-two<00:02:51.760> old<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.630> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
the old one then thirty-two old just so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.440 
the old one then thirty-two old just so
if<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.220> there<00:02:54.430> comes<00:02:54.700> out<00:02:54.850> with<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.000> fix<00:02:55.240> you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
if you if there comes out with a fix you

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.180 
if you if there comes out with a fix you
can<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.470> take<00:02:59.470> out<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.800> new<00:02:59.980> one

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
can you can take out the new one

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.760 
can you can take out the new one
completely<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.180> put<00:03:02.110> back<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.470> other<00:03:02.620> one

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
completely and put back in the other one

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.530 
completely and put back in the other one
and<00:03:02.980> apply<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.280> patch<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.209> makes<00:03:04.420> it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
and apply the patch it just makes it

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.660 
and apply the patch it just makes it
easier<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.380> changed<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.550> new

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
easier and it's changed it the the new

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.720 
easier and it's changed it the the new
folder<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.030> bin<00:03:07.390> 32<00:03:07.870> all<00:03:08.709> right<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.430> we<00:03:09.610> got

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
folder to bin 32 all right so we got

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.000 
folder to bin 32 all right so we got
that<00:03:09.940> changed<00:03:10.570> all<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.470> let's<00:03:11.770> give<00:03:11.980> it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that changed all that so let's give it

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.820 
that changed all that so let's give it
another<00:03:12.430> try

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.830 

that<00:03:19.430> would<00:03:19.550> really<00:03:19.760> suck<00:03:19.880> if<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.540> didn't

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
that would really suck if this didn't

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:33.220 
that would really suck if this didn't
work<00:03:23.320> launching<00:03:24.320> launching<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:26.210> launching

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.630 

huh

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.950 

let's<00:03:38.480> try<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> launch<00:03:38.960> it<00:03:39.170> again<00:03:39.410> ah<00:03:40.900> there<00:03:41.900> we

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
let's try to launch it again ah there we

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.550 
let's try to launch it again ah there we
go

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.830 

I<00:03:44.650> think

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.780 

um

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
um

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.260 
um
it's<00:03:51.360> still<00:03:51.750> launching<00:03:52.140> up

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
it's still launching up

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.010 
it's still launching up
see<00:03:54.870> something<00:03:55.080> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> background

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.100 

well<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.380> kind<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.130> weird<00:04:00.340> let<00:04:00.520> me<00:04:00.580> all<00:04:00.730> tab

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
well it kind of weird let me all tab

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.550 
well it kind of weird let me all tab
there<00:04:02.110> we<00:04:02.200> go

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
there we go

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.490 
there we go
I<00:04:02.590> mean<00:04:03.520> I'll<00:04:03.670> enter<00:04:04.240> all<00:04:04.480> enter<00:04:04.900> twice<00:04:05.200> and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
I mean I'll enter all enter twice and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.120 
I mean I'll enter all enter twice and
boom<00:04:06.100> we<00:04:06.820> got<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.150> playing<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.500> that's<00:04:08.800> how<00:04:09.070> you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
fix a 4head I heard it works with crisis

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.990 
fix a 4head I heard it works with crisis
as<00:04:13.150> well<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.920> I'm<00:04:14.920> pretty<00:04:15.310> sure<00:04:15.580> if<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.730> get

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
as well and I'm pretty sure if you get

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.060 
as well and I'm pretty sure if you get
just<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.780> install<00:04:17.350> directory<00:04:17.680> of

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
just going to the install directory of

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.600 
just going to the install directory of
the<00:04:18.280> origin<00:04:19.020> game<00:04:20.020> for<00:04:20.290> crisis<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:21.130> should<00:04:21.160> be

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
the origin game for crisis you should be

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.880 
the origin game for crisis you should be
able<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.850> do<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.180> same<00:04:22.510> thing<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.170> for<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.860> to

able to do the same thing and for it to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.280 
able to do the same thing and for it to
work<00:04:24.160> all<00:04:24.850> right<00:04:25.000> it's<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.540> big<00:04:25.720> man<00:04:25.930> Thor

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
got going for them is that um Intel Core

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.240 
got going for them is that um Intel Core
2<00:04:34.600> Duo<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:37.210> wish<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:38.050> wish<00:04:38.260> NVIDIA<00:04:38.710> didn't<00:04:39.070> like

2 Duo I wish I wish NVIDIA didn't like

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.900 
2 Duo I wish I wish NVIDIA didn't like
by<00:04:40.090> physics<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.110> everyone<00:04:41.620> can<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.160> be

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
by physics so everyone can have it be

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.360 
by physics so everyone can have it be
yeah<00:04:43.030> that's<00:04:43.840> how<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.200> get<00:04:44.590> Crysis<00:04:45.160> warhead

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
yeah that's how you get Crysis warhead

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.060 
yeah that's how you get Crysis warhead
in<00:04:46.240> crisis<00:04:47.080> I'm<00:04:47.320> pretty<00:04:47.560> sure<00:04:47.710> works<00:04:47.950> on

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
in crisis I'm pretty sure works on

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.890 
in crisis I'm pretty sure works on
