00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
government officials in Russia have been

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.550 
government officials in Russia have been
experimenting<00:00:03.149> with<00:00:03.360> cloud<00:00:03.810> seeding<00:00:04.230> for

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
experimenting with cloud seeding for

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.260 
experimenting with cloud seeding for
years<00:00:04.890> as<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> way<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.400> manipulate<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> weather

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
years as a way to manipulate the weather

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.570 
years as a way to manipulate the weather
for<00:00:06.960> example<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.410> mayor<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.710> Moscow<00:00:08.130> says<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
for example the mayor of Moscow says the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.339 
for example the mayor of Moscow says the
cleanup<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.179> heavy<00:00:09.389> snow<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.990> too<00:00:10.139> expensive

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
cleanup of heavy snow is too expensive

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.520 
cleanup of heavy snow is too expensive
so<00:00:11.070> he<00:00:11.460> wants<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.849> displace<00:00:12.450> winter<00:00:12.840> snow<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
so he wants to displace winter snow to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.589 
so he wants to displace winter snow to
the<00:00:13.559> surrounding<00:00:14.190> towns<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the surrounding towns but one of the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.120 
the surrounding towns but one of the
dangers<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> trying<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.440> control<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> weather

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130

Guy<00:00:19.740> bill<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.670> let's<00:00:20.880> start<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.180> what<00:00:21.510> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
Guy bill first let's start with what is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.310 
Guy bill first let's start with what is
cloud<00:00:22.050> seeding<00:00:22.460> well<00:00:23.460> clouds<00:00:23.820> form<00:00:24.320> with

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
cloud seeding well clouds form with

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.650 
cloud seeding well clouds form with
water<00:00:25.619> droplets<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.430> particles<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.390> dust

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
water droplets on particles of dust

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.400 
water droplets on particles of dust
without<00:00:28.320> dust<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.210> or<00:00:30.210> particles<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> salt

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
without dust or or particles of salt

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
without dust or or particles of salt
blown<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> sea<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.700> evaporate<00:00:33.180> off

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
blown up from the sea that evaporate off

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
blown up from the sea that evaporate off
the<00:00:33.450> sea<00:00:33.630> surface<00:00:33.840> without<00:00:34.230> those<00:00:34.410> dust<00:00:34.770> or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the sea surface without those dust or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
the sea surface without those dust or
salt<00:00:35.219> particles<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:36.360> wouldn't<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.780> clouds

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
salt particles you wouldn't have clouds

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.290 
salt particles you wouldn't have clouds
and<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> wouldn't<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.680> rain<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> idea

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
and you wouldn't have rain so the idea

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.560 
and you wouldn't have rain so the idea
is<00:00:39.500> let's<00:00:40.500> disperse<00:00:41.250> our<00:00:41.550> own<00:00:41.700> particles<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
is let's disperse our own particles on

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.080 
is let's disperse our own particles on
top<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> clouds<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.399> rain<00:00:44.430> droplets

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
top of the clouds and the rain droplets

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
top of the clouds and the rain droplets
will<00:00:45.239> form<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> snowflakes<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.590> form

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
will form or the snowflakes will form

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
will form or the snowflakes will form
and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.670> control<00:00:48.149> where<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.629> rains

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and then we can control where it rains

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.439 
and then we can control where it rains
but<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.739> difficult<00:00:50.160> problem<00:00:50.730> can

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
but it's a very difficult problem can

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
but it's a very difficult problem can
you<00:00:51.629> use<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> mayor<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> Moscow<00:00:52.980> wants

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you use like the mayor of Moscow wants

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270 
you use like the mayor of Moscow wants
to<00:00:53.399> use<00:00:53.670> cloud<00:00:54.030> seeding<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.750> push<00:00:55.469> snow<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
to use cloud seeding to push snow out of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
to use cloud seeding to push snow out of
town<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:57.360> town<00:00:57.570> B<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.739> idea

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
town a into town B well that's the idea

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.290 
town a into town B well that's the idea
that<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.699> would<00:00:59.730> seed<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> clouds

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that you would you would seed the clouds

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.740 
that you would you would seed the clouds
upwind<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.559> Moscow<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.489> Moscow<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
upwind of Moscow now Moscow is about a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
upwind of Moscow now Moscow is about a
thousand<00:01:04.439> square<00:01:04.710> kilometres<00:01:05.040> about<00:01:05.670> 400

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thousand square kilometres about 400

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140 
thousand square kilometres about 400
square<00:01:06.510> miles<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> centimeter

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
square miles so if you have a centimeter

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.500 
square miles so if you have a centimeter
of<00:01:09.390> snow<00:01:09.540> half<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.530> inch<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> snow<00:01:11.270> you've<00:01:12.270> got

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
of snow half an inch of snow you've got

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.980 
of snow half an inch of snow you've got
about<00:01:12.659> 10<00:01:13.229> million<00:01:13.740> tons<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.939> rain<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.659> water

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
about 10 million tons of rain of water

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
about 10 million tons of rain of water
10<00:01:16.770> million<00:01:17.250> tons<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.810> difficult

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
10 million tons it's a very difficult

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.039 
10 million tons it's a very difficult
thing<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> control<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.549> by<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
thing to control and by the way the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.179 
thing to control and by the way the
Russians<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.890> their<00:01:23.400> creative<00:01:24.350> manner<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
Russians in their creative manner are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.910 
Russians in their creative manner are
using<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.060> silver<00:01:27.689> iodide<00:01:27.869> particles<00:01:28.829> which

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
using not silver iodide particles which

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.450 
using not silver iodide particles which
is<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.189> old<00:01:29.340> trick<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.689> dry<00:01:31.170> ice<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.040> piece

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
is an old trick not dry ice but piece

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.440 
is an old trick not dry ice but piece
but<00:01:32.909> particles<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> cement<00:01:34.549> right<00:01:35.549> 500<00:01:36.180> grade

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
but particles of cement right 500 grade

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
but particles of cement right 500 grade
cement<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.170> very<00:01:37.380> fine<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.799> flour<00:01:38.130> or

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
cement which is very fine like flour or

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.490 
cement which is very fine like flour or
kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> cement<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.630> you're<00:01:40.200> pouring

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
kind of cement and so you're pouring

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280 
kind of cement and so you're pouring
cement<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.280> top<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> clouds<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.840> make<00:01:43.020> 10

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
cement on top of the clouds to make 10

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
cement on top of the clouds to make 10
million<00:01:43.560> tonnes<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.189> rain<00:01:44.430> come<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> mean

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
million tonnes of rain come out I mean

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
million tonnes of rain come out I mean
it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> difficult<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.680> fact<00:01:46.890> they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it's a difficult thing and in fact they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
it's a difficult thing and in fact they
didn't<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.549> rain<00:01:47.790> during<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.479> national

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
didn't want rain during a national

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780 
didn't want rain during a national
holiday<00:01:49.439> last<00:01:49.920> year<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.310> they<00:01:50.430> were<00:01:50.520> throwing

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
holiday last year so they were throwing

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
holiday last year so they were throwing
that<00:01:50.880> cement<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> apparently<00:01:52.380> something

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
that cement up and apparently something

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
that cement up and apparently something
happened<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> clouds<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> chunk<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
happened in the clouds and a chunk of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
happened in the clouds and a chunk of
cement<00:01:54.720> fell<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> sky<00:01:55.649> onto<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
cement fell out of the sky onto a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
cement fell out of the sky onto a
Muscovites<00:01:56.610> house<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.719> some<00:01:57.960> risks

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
Muscovites house so there are some risks

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
Muscovites house so there are some risks
can<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> talk<00:01:58.950> about<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> risks<00:01:59.729> well<00:02:00.240> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
can you talk about the risks well this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
can you talk about the risks well this
is<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.560> probably<00:02:02.159> people<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is I think that's probably people in the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.389 
is I think that's probably people in the
plane<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.930> being<00:02:04.290> disciplined<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.159> their

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
plane not being disciplined with their

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.930 
plane not being disciplined with their
bag<00:02:05.670> opening<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:06.479> speculating<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
bag opening I'm speculating but the the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.690 
bag opening I'm speculating but the the
idea<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.360> remember<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.200> rains<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:11.310> somebody

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
idea is remember it rains if somebody

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.809 
idea is remember it rains if somebody
says<00:02:11.970> there's<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.739> 70%

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
says there's a 70%

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.420 
says there's a 70%
chance<00:02:13.999> of<00:02:14.150> rain<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.900> means<00:02:15.590> there's<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.010> 30%

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
chance of rain it means there's a 30%

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.099 
chance of rain it means there's a 30%
chance<00:02:16.999> that<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.359> won't<00:02:17.569> rain

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
chance that it won't rain

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.550 
chance that it won't rain
well<00:02:18.530> 30%<00:02:19.189> that's<00:02:19.549> gonna<00:02:19.760> happen<00:02:19.969> so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
well 30% that's gonna happen so

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.530 
well 30% that's gonna happen so
scientists<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.709> make<00:02:21.889> claims<00:02:22.340> based<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:23.090> one

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
scientists can make claims based on one

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.890 
scientists can make claims based on one
or<00:02:23.900> two<00:02:24.170> events<00:02:24.909> that<00:02:25.909> really<00:02:26.150> aren't<00:02:26.599> proof

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
idea of cloud seeding is intuitive it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.879 
idea of cloud seeding is intuitive it
seems<00:02:31.969> like<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.329> should<00:02:32.540> work<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
seems like it should work but it's the

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.640 
seems like it should work but it's the

scale of it the size of it that makes it

scale of it the size of it that makes it
so<00:02:36.709> difficult<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.420> they<00:02:38.540> drop<00:02:38.840> cement<00:02:39.260> on

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
so difficult so that they drop cement on

u.s.<00:02:47.480> well<00:02:47.959> people<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.379> tried<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.889> people

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
u.s. well people have tried it people

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.190 
u.s. well people have tried it people
have<00:02:49.280> tried<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.549> for<00:02:49.700> many<00:02:49.849> years<00:02:49.939> and<00:02:50.540> they

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
have tried it for many years and they

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920 
have tried it for many years and they
try<00:02:51.379> to<00:02:51.409> ski<00:02:51.889> areas<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.549> know<00:02:52.639> I've<00:02:53.150> spent

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
try to ski areas you know I've spent

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470 
try to ski areas you know I've spent
some<00:02:54.769> time<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> mountains<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:56.359> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
some time in the mountains in the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.479 
some time in the mountains in the
Pacific<00:02:56.810> Northwest<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.650> I've<00:02:58.250> seen

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
Pacific Northwest and I've seen

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.509 
Pacific Northwest and I've seen
situations<00:02:58.730> where<00:02:59.260> clouds<00:03:00.260> are<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:00.919> raining

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
situations where clouds are it's raining

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.819 
situations where clouds are it's raining
or<00:03:01.669> snowing<00:03:01.760> on<00:03:02.359> like<00:03:02.629> a<00:03:02.810> swath<00:03:03.439> about<00:03:03.799> a

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
or snowing on like a swath about a

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.729 
or snowing on like a swath about a
football<00:03:04.400> field<00:03:04.699> wide<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.599> then<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.469> clouds

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
football field wide and then the clouds

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.679 
football field wide and then the clouds
on<00:03:06.949> either<00:03:07.069> side<00:03:07.400> are<00:03:07.609> unaffected<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.510> not

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
on either side are unaffected it's not

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.330 
on either side are unaffected it's not
snowing<00:03:08.959> or<00:03:09.199> raining<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.590> those<00:03:09.739> clouds<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
snowing or raining in those clouds and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.819 
snowing or raining in those clouds and
so<00:03:11.239> people<00:03:11.659> at<00:03:11.870> ski<00:03:12.109> areas<00:03:12.409> have<00:03:12.560> thought<00:03:12.709> well

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
so people at ski areas have thought well

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.409 
so people at ski areas have thought well
if<00:03:12.889> we<00:03:12.980> could<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.250> get<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.549> snow<00:03:14.180> just

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
if we could just get it to snow just

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.619 
if we could just get it to snow just
write<00:03:14.629> down<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.169> ribbon<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.859> ski<00:03:16.699> of<00:03:16.969> ski

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
write down this one ribbon of ski of ski

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.929 
write down this one ribbon of ski of ski
slope<00:03:17.930> they<00:03:18.769> would<00:03:18.919> have<00:03:19.069> some<00:03:19.340> economic

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
slope they would have some economic

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.849 
slope they would have some economic
advantage<00:03:20.389> but<00:03:20.629> it's<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.840> very<00:03:21.169> very<00:03:21.500> difficult

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
advantage but it's a very very difficult

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.039 
advantage but it's a very very difficult
thing<00:03:22.159> to<00:03:22.340> do<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.790> got<00:03:22.939> have<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.359> get<00:03:23.479> so<00:03:23.840> many

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
thing to do you got have to get so many

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.499 
thing to do you got have to get so many
particles<00:03:24.650> into<00:03:24.889> the<00:03:24.919> air<00:03:25.009> at<00:03:25.459> just<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.329> right

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:26.509 
particles into the air at just the right

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.170 
particles into the air at just the right
time<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:27.650> clouds<00:03:27.919> have<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.430> behave<00:03:28.609> just

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
time and the clouds have to behave just

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.449 
time and the clouds have to behave just
the<00:03:29.359> way<00:03:29.479> you<00:03:29.540> want<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.989> know<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.319> idea<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.919> if

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
the way you want you know the idea is if

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.770 
the way you want you know the idea is if
it<00:03:31.609> starts<00:03:31.849> raining<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.269> one<00:03:32.389> part<00:03:32.659> of<00:03:32.689> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
it starts raining in one part of the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.719 
it starts raining in one part of the
cloud<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.590> whole<00:03:33.769> thing<00:03:34.009> will<00:03:34.159> start<00:03:34.370> raining

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
cloud the whole thing will start raining

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.129 
cloud the whole thing will start raining
but<00:03:34.939> I<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.209> tell<00:03:35.389> you<00:03:35.479> from<00:03:35.540> experience<00:03:35.689> that

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
but I can tell you from experience that
