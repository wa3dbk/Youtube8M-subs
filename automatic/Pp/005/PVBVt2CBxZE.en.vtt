right<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.829> what<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.399> here<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:03.230> motorola

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
right so what we have here is a motorola

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.870 
right so what we have here is a motorola
bike<00:00:04.920> speed<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.580> cadence<00:00:05.759> sensor<00:00:07.460> for<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
bike speed and cadence sensor for the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.190 
bike speed and cadence sensor for the
moto<00:00:09.719> active<00:00:10.340> which<00:00:11.340> i<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:11.849> its<00:00:12.030> i<00:00:12.269> watch

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
moto active which i have on its i watch

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.420 
moto active which i have on its i watch
strap<00:00:14.240> contraption<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.299> my<00:00:15.480> life<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> let's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
strap contraption of my life so let's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.509 
strap contraption of my life so let's
say<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> box<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.170> cash<00:00:25.680> warren

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
say we get in the box so we cash warren

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.450 
say we get in the box so we cash warren
carrots<00:00:26.939> manual<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.920> main<00:00:29.099> things<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
carrots manual and the main things that

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.319 
carrots manual and the main things that
device<00:00:29.820> itself<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> sensor<00:00:32.820> needs

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
device itself so this the sensor needs

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
device itself so this the sensor needs
we<00:00:33.570> made<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> bike<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.070> see

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
we made it to the bike as you can see

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.869 
we made it to the bike as you can see
it's<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.700> unit<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.140> i<00:00:37.440> believe<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.550> part

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it's one unit so i believe this part

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.260 
it's one unit so i believe this part
will<00:00:39.030> pick<00:00:39.270> up<00:00:39.420> bar<00:00:40.250> wheel<00:00:41.250> speed<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
will pick up bar wheel speed and this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.459 
will pick up bar wheel speed and this
powerful<00:00:42.690> pick<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.969> your<00:00:44.969> pedals<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
powerful pick up your pedals or your the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
powerful pick up your pedals or your the
way<00:00:46.559> around<00:00:46.620> leave<00:00:47.460> us<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.820> because

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
way around leave us that way because

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.330 
way around leave us that way because
they'll<00:00:48.719> melt<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> frame<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.719> have

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
they'll melt on the frame and we have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
they'll melt on the frame and we have
here<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.600> magnets<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.350> have

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
here we have two magnets and you have

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.289 
here we have two magnets and you have
two<00:00:58.890> maggots<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:04.610> that's<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.760> ruler<00:01:06.030> clip

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
two maggots so that's a ruler clip

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
two maggots so that's a ruler clip
that's<00:01:06.479> remaining<00:01:06.960> ish<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.400> need

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's remaining ish so you don't need

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.750 
that's remaining ish so you don't need
any<00:01:08.760> cable<00:01:09.210> ties<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:11.010> handy

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.749 

this<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.270> confused<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> pictures<00:01:16.759> but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this it confused me in the pictures but

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
this it confused me in the pictures but
it's<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.270> pieces<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.509> am<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it's actually two pieces so that am you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's actually two pieces so that am you
remove<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:23.070> whittier<00:01:23.790> pedals<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
remove your whittier pedals and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.190 
remove your whittier pedals and
that<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.400> magnet<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.960> then

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that on that's a magnet there and then

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.160 
that on that's a magnet there and then
this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> other<00:01:28.860> Magnus<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.750> screw

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this is the other Magnus which you screw

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.210 
this is the other Magnus which you screw
on<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.159> slope<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:34.770> i<00:01:34.799> read<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
on to a slope so from what i read the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.800 
on to a slope so from what i read the
manual<00:01:35.670> there's<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:36.810> lights<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.680> so

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
manual there's some lights in here so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.130 
manual there's some lights in here so
when<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.930> magnet<00:01:40.350> goes<00:01:40.500> by<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> red<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
when that magnet goes by the red one is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.289 
when that magnet goes by the red one is
when<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.770> sensor<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.549> magnet<00:01:45.060> which

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
when your sensor is in this magnet which

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.730 
when your sensor is in this magnet which
goes<00:01:45.509> by<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.649> other

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
goes by here it's one of your other

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
goes by here it's one of your other
sensors<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.810> easy<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.229> figure

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
sensors so it's pretty easy to figure

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.219 
sensors so it's pretty easy to figure
out<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:49.920> working<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
out when it's working or not and in

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.249 
out when it's working or not and in
terms<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> pairing<00:01:53.100> ish<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.049> well

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
terms of pairing ish then I have well

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.520 
terms of pairing ish then I have well
this<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.619> work

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.960 

as<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.740> see<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.070> survives<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.550> drop<00:02:00.700> test

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
as you can see it survives it drop test

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.230 
as you can see it survives it drop test
as<00:02:01.210> well<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.880> activate

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
as well so that's so we can activate

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.490 
as well so that's so we can activate
that<00:02:07.450> anytime<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:11.020> let's<00:02:11.260> try

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
that anytime you want so let's try

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.080 
that anytime you want so let's try
something<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:19.209> will<00:02:19.420> go<00:02:19.630> back<00:02:21.090> we

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
something like this we will go back we

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.699 
something like this we will go back we
will<00:02:22.300> go<00:02:22.540> settings<00:02:24.810> sensors<00:02:26.069> add<00:02:27.069> sensor

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
will go settings sensors add sensor

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.120 
will go settings sensors add sensor
speed<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.890> cadence<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.520> oh<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.860> already

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
speed and cadence is oh it's already

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.759 
speed and cadence is oh it's already
famish<00:02:35.220> connecting<00:02:36.220> successful<00:02:38.250> done<00:02:40.769> so

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
famish connecting successful done so

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.590 
famish connecting successful done so
let's<00:02:42.010> say<00:02:42.250> let's<00:02:42.700> fake<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.209> work<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
let's say let's fake it work it and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.640 
let's say let's fake it work it and
cycling<00:02:46.600> indoors<00:02:48.390> fixed<00:02:49.390> Irish

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:05.690 

yeah<00:02:54.220> start<00:02:54.730> key<00:02:54.939> to<00:02:55.269> begin<00:02:57.180> so<00:03:01.409> there<00:03:02.409> we<00:03:02.530> go

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.809 

yeah<00:03:06.810> cadence<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:07.930> working<00:03:08.319> anyway<00:03:08.819> start

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
yeah cadence is working anyway start

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.069 
yeah cadence is working anyway start
with<00:03:09.939> glare<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.420> camera<00:03:10.750> I've<00:03:10.840> no<00:03:11.019> idea

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
with glare in the camera I've no idea

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.110 
with glare in the camera I've no idea
whites<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.709> now<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.159> my<00:03:12.280> lens<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.670> posted

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
whites to now I think my lens is posted

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.009
