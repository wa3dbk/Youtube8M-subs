internet<00:00:43.109> for<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.530> least<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:43.980> three<00:00:44.010> hours

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
internet for at least two or three hours

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.590 
internet for at least two or three hours
tonight<00:00:44.550> trying<00:00:44.909> to<00:00:44.969> figure<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.359> to<00:00:45.420> get

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
tonight trying to figure out how to get

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.029 
tonight trying to figure out how to get
them<00:00:45.749> back<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> no<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.440> seemed<00:00:46.679> to<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.890> how

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
them back and no one seemed to know how

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.630 
them back and no one seemed to know how
to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.339> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to do it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
to do it
so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> figured<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.899> how<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.379> my<00:00:49.559> own

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so I figured out how to do it on my own

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.079 
so I figured out how to do it on my own
and<00:00:50.699> that's<00:00:50.879> how<00:00:50.999> you<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.839> back

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
and that's how you would get them back

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.009 
and that's how you would get them back

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.290 
and so it brings the NBA greatest menu
and<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> game<00:01:31.470> where

that has that team that you just delete
it<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.800> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.370> case<00:01:35.580> it<00:01:35.760> should<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it and I think in this case it should be

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.800 
it and I think in this case it should be
Jerry<00:01:36.720> West<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> wait<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.659> the
