but<00:02:04.869> our<00:02:04.960> failures<00:02:05.409> are<00:02:05.590> not<00:02:05.740> final

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
but our failures are not final

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
but I found myself not being able to

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.559 
but I found myself not being able to
deny<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.400> was<00:02:14.580> something<00:02:14.790> still<00:02:15.269> here

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
deny that there was something still here

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.979 
deny that there was something still here
that<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:15.989> just<00:02:17.239> does<00:02:18.239> anybody<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:18.870> I'm

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
that was just does anybody know what I'm

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.110

talking<00:02:19.319> about<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.650> here

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.990 

I<00:02:23.830> know<00:02:24.830> everybody<00:02:25.250> can't<00:02:25.519> show

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.060 

because<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.690> person<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.110> said<00:02:33.320> nice<00:02:33.590> next<00:02:33.950> to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
because the person you said nice next to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.600 
because the person you said nice next to
might<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.580> understand

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.520 

but<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.670> will<00:02:41.849> say<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.750> are<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.290> good

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
but I will say this if you are in a good

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.210 
but I will say this if you are in a good
relationship<00:02:44.040> tonight

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
relationship tonight

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.110 
relationship tonight
it<00:02:46.820> was<00:02:47.030> good<00:02:47.270> it's<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.840> good<00:02:48.020> one<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
it was good it's a good one if it's the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.090 
it was good it's a good one if it's the
real<00:02:50.270> thing

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
real thing

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.930 
real thing
then<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.190> don't<00:02:52.370> think<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:52.820> would<00:02:52.910> be

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
then I don't think that it would be

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.470 
then I don't think that it would be
improper<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:54.640> maybe<00:02:55.640> silently<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.450> yourself

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
improper to maybe silently to yourself

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.480 
improper to maybe silently to yourself
give<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.170> little<00:02:57.350> gratitude<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:58.160> all<00:02:58.280> the

give a little gratitude to all the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.730 
give a little gratitude to all the
people<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:58.910> went<00:02:59.120> before<00:02:59.290> in<00:03:00.290> order<00:03:00.560> to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
people that went before in order to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.160 
people that went before in order to
prepare<00:03:01.130> him<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.480> prepare<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.140> for

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
words and if I had the chance I would

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.290 
words and if I had the chance I would
probably<00:03:22.239> say<00:03:22.660> something<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:23.230> her<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:23.620> this
