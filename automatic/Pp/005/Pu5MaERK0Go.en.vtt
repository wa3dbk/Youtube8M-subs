00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 hey and thanks for turning it on today 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.309
 there again delicious pasta and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 for that I have here is ever 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.639
 a pot of water 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 should also be a cook in the same 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.920
 next few minutes the middle left 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.029
 can boil and that's just 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 of course still needs a class 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.279
 delicious sauce and we come to that now 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.859
 Immediately the sauce is quite fast 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.630
 we prepared that first 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 ham 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.000
 I have 1.2 kilo tortellini here now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.570
 because I afterwards guests expect to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 even six eggs hog a can 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.660
 with doctors and that's about 200 grams 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 rubbed parmesan we need 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.559
 still salt that is a nutmeg the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.640
 both pure and as an important ingredient 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.460
 I do not stand here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 that's his homepage right away and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.109
 then things start like the preparation of the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.830
 stove was unfortunately faster than me 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.979
 let's take care of the teenies first 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.350
 weigh about since I had before 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.330
 so he does not get up faster 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 temperature is and now we go here 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.619
 slowly add the tortellini but 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 beware, because the water is us 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.360
 certainly now really hot and if 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 you do it again now 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 but that's right and you can 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.610
 easily scalded therefore piece us 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.610
 for piece to give 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 they stick open to each other the whole 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.000
 then simmer for about five minutes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.160
 and as soon as the above are swimming the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.770
 Chinese in most cases but so 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.090
 that would be edict the toffees 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.710
 I have here in the meantime 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.650
 cast that we find here in 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.440
 despite staying there they were still beautiful 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.600
 and now we can only care about the sauce 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.530
 and here is the cream in it 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.690
 and now go back ingredients other 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.000
 add up to the ham foliage vegetables 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.350
 and later the whole thing is mixed up 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 and yes there are only eggs here 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.959
 In addition, these are a total of six pieces I 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.950
 I have now bought here at the farmers 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.100
 strangely, it's a bit bigger than that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.750
 I buy normally in Krefeld 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.080
 only organic egg what I noticed 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.239
 is that also sometimes if you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.970
 beer eggs we have a whole 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.970
 different color from the example 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
 of free range or soil maintenance 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 noticed by with young 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.090
 maybe I'm not the only one 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:53.530
 Celebrations are added now we can look around 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:58.030
 then add everything to the cheese 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.790
 a little bit more like salt 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.069
 out 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.310
 the cheese is already a lot anyway anyway 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:15.109
 taste from now comes the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:16.970
 nutmeg crisis more pure 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:24.680
 I'll show it shortly thereafter 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.480
 the camera of the tunnel so much in it 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040
 I would appreciate a half 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.280
 teaspoon me but also really 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.409
 pure peace perfect in the next 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.049
 step we cut now briefly 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:42.650
 the ham is best small 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.010
 dice stripes rings my god like 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.409
 its popular we are equal but 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.579
 shortly seared 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.919
 because matters worse ruiz the sauce the 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.150
 Youth still mix and yes that has 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.909
 much of a great dish some olive oil 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.299
 let pan get hot 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.269
 then waving fry the same and now 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.040
 But let's start with the sauce 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.359
 I do not have this mountain full 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.889
 cream 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:18.289
 it's a very rich one 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:20.030
 court but it is also very strong 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.070
 I have to first under birth here 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.070
 if it is a creamy consistency 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.190
 right through the cheese and eggs whole 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.849
 as well as I stir but no children 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.849
 gives 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.180
 if the parties is hot then with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.850
 send roast problem so are you in 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:50.360
 let live spanier simmer and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:52.750
 finished is a wonderful solved yet 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.750
 much 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.759
 I also fry the ham and locos 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.759
 now time to anyway 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:19.080
 wonderful there is still a bit of 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.430
 The doctors taste great and 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:43.140
 There is also a nice contrast 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:44.670
 Why would I stir up the color? 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.730
 Anyway , that's important 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.500
 so that it does not burn and they come 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:55.140
 airlines prefer not to mix up and 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:59.190
 then it's almost done the trainings 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:01.730
 A bit of pepper was sticking too 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:06.750
 pan is big enough 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:11.280
 wonderfully said doses 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:14.490
 simmer a bit and then it is 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.230
 but also finished if necessary 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:22.710
 a little spice with pepper and 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:25.020
 a bit salt so the bertolini is 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.250
 prepared a tip from me if 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.160
 half an hour to eat 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.440
 wait could take a casserole dish 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.970
 a bit cheese over and off 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.740
 in the oven for half an hour 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.960
 that also plays great 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.450
 just because it's over baking and on 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.230
 Thank you for watching any case 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.360
 I would be happy if next time 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.960
 be back and then until the 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.960
 next look
