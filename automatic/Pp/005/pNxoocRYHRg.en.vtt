00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.309 

so<00:00:02.840> first<00:00:03.840> step<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.980> remove<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.839> two<00:00:06.839> bolts

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
so first step is to remove the two bolts

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.160 
so first step is to remove the two bolts
that<00:00:07.859> hold<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.420> throttle<00:00:09.420> position<00:00:09.540> sensor

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
that hold the throttle position sensor

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.900 
that hold the throttle position sensor
to<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.690> throttle<00:00:12.690> body<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.370> then<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.790> be

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
to the throttle body and then I will be

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
to the throttle body and then I will be
using<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.750> contact<00:00:16.139> cleaner<00:00:16.320> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
using a bit of the contact cleaner to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.380 
using a bit of the contact cleaner to
clean<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.119> dust<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:20.460> inside<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
clean up the dust and the inside of this

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
clean up the dust and the inside of this
mechanism<00:00:24.109> I'm<00:00:25.109> using<00:00:25.320> contact<00:00:25.740> cleaner

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
mechanism I'm using contact cleaner

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.769 
mechanism I'm using contact cleaner
because<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.939> know<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.630> are<00:00:27.660> any

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
because I don't know if there are any

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.540 
because I don't know if there are any
contacts<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> electrical

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
contacts in there and the electrical

00:00:29.550 --> 00:01:12.320 
contacts in there and the electrical
currents<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> may

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.300 

that's<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:14.510> characteristics<00:01:16.310> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that's right characteristics that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:27.310 
that's right characteristics that
require<00:01:17.640> love<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.940> newer

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
require love so this is the the newer

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
require love so this is the the newer
throttle<00:01:28.320> position<00:01:28.440> sensor<00:01:28.980> that<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
throttle position sensor that I will be

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600 
throttle position sensor that I will be
putting<00:01:29.730> in<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.120> am<00:01:30.800> cleaning<00:01:31.800> inside<00:01:32.220> with

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
putting in I am cleaning inside with

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:52.200 
putting in I am cleaning inside with
contact<00:01:33.240> cleaner<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:39.110> also<00:01:40.760> contacts

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.820 

so<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:53.420> I'm<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.230> align<00:01:56.320> notches<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.650> the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
so now I'm here to align notches on the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.450 
so now I'm here to align notches on the
plastic<00:01:58.670> parts<00:01:59.170> position<00:02:00.170> sensor<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:01.160> not

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
plastic parts position sensor is not

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:20.760 
plastic parts position sensor is not
just<00:02:02.320> with<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.410> metal<00:02:03.710> plates<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:08.360> them

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:31.350 

and<00:02:20.880> after<00:02:21.880> aligning<00:02:22.150> them<00:02:22.450> twist<00:02:23.370> sensor<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
and after aligning them twist sensor so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.120 
and after aligning them twist sensor so
it<00:02:31.450> seems<00:02:31.720> there<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.050> two<00:02:32.230> versions<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it seems there are two versions of the

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.750 
it seems there are two versions of the
throttle<00:02:33.340> position<00:02:33.610> sensor<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.900> can<00:02:35.110> see

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
throttle position sensor as you can see

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.800 
throttle position sensor as you can see
in<00:02:36.760> here<00:02:37.300> my<00:02:38.520> metal<00:02:39.520> notches<00:02:39.940> metal<00:02:40.510> notches

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
in here my metal notches metal notches

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.340 
in here my metal notches metal notches
on<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.080> throttle<00:02:41.440> body<00:02:41.650> are<00:02:42.070> horizontal<00:02:43.350> one

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
on this throttle body are horizontal one

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.080 
on this throttle body are horizontal one
here<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.090> one<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.710> then<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.670> total

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
here and one here and then the total

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.700 
here and one here and then the total
position<00:02:49.240> sensor<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:50.050> using<00:02:50.380> is

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
position sensor that I'm using is

00:02:50.710 --> 00:03:00.870 
position sensor that I'm using is
vertical<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.630> have<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> problem<00:02:53.140> here

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:14.199 

you

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.440 

so<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.720> clone<00:03:15.989> half<00:03:16.319> way<00:03:16.590> now

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
so here is the clone half way now

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.440 
so here is the clone half way now
marking<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.599> spot<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.470> make<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.769> hole<00:03:20.450> so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
marking the spot to make the hole so

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.569 
marking the spot to make the hole so
align<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> two<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.530> two<00:03:22.709> metal<00:03:23.040> plates<00:03:23.159> and

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
align the two the two metal plates and

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.670 
align the two the two metal plates and
then<00:03:23.760> run<00:03:24.720> volt<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.920> some<00:03:26.129> ink<00:03:27.049> through<00:03:28.049> top

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
then run volt with some ink through top

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.240 
then run volt with some ink through top
one<00:03:29.569> to<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.599> bottom<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.140> already<00:03:31.500> did<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.890> but

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
one to the bottom I already did this but

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240 
one to the bottom I already did this but
just<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.780> illustrate<00:03:34.129> so<00:03:35.129> now

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
just to it's just to illustrate so now

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.050 
just to it's just to illustrate so now
I'm<00:03:35.519> making<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.940> hole<00:03:36.629> I<00:03:37.519> want<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.819> hole<00:03:39.030> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
I'm making the hole I want the hole to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.759 
I'm making the hole I want the hole to
be<00:03:39.209> rotated<00:03:39.780> 90<00:03:40.170> degrees<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.170> plates<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
be rotated 90 degrees and the plates to

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.420 
be rotated 90 degrees and the plates to
be<00:03:43.799> aligned<00:03:45.560> between<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> clone<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
be aligned between the clone and the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.580 
be aligned between the clone and the
original<00:03:48.349> part<00:03:50.329> I've<00:03:51.329> marked<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.989> original

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
original part I've marked the original

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.879 
original part I've marked the original
all<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.489> surrounding<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.329> Torino<00:03:54.750> ho<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.709> I

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
all the surrounding of Torino ho then I

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.809 
all the surrounding of Torino ho then I
inverted<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.639> right<00:03:57.859> edges<00:03:58.859> on<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.609> round

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
inverted the right edges on the round

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.729 
inverted the right edges on the round
ones<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.700> try<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.030> remake<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.900> while

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
ones so I can try and remake this while

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.550 
ones so I can try and remake this while
you<00:04:04.859> are<00:04:04.920> doing<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.400> work<00:04:06.109> be<00:04:07.109> sure<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.440> be

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
you are doing this work be sure to be

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:32.790 
you are doing this work be sure to be
trying<00:04:07.920> out<00:04:08.099> this<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.940> car

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.960 

you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.900 

okay<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> have<00:04:39.140> already<00:04:39.350> gone<00:04:39.740> for<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> protest

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
okay I have already gone for a protest

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.290 
okay I have already gone for a protest
right<00:04:41.180> after<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:42.320> model<00:04:43.190> in<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.760> sense<00:04:44.150> of

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
right after the model in the sense of

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.540 
right after the model in the sense of
replacement<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.760> now<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.820> idol<00:04:47.360> stays<00:04:48.550> right

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
replacement and now the idol stays right

00:04:49.550 --> 00:05:14.690 
replacement and now the idol stays right
where<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.910> should<00:04:49.940> be

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.490 

so<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:15.660> like<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.590> result<00:05:17.490> very<00:05:17.700> much<00:05:17.940> because

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
so I like the result very much because

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.660 
so I like the result very much because
the<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.980> engine<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.430> much<00:05:20.640> quieter<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:22.670> it

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670
