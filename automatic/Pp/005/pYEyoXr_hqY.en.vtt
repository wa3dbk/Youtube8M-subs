natural<00:02:22.190> wastage<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.000> speak<00:02:23.239> as<00:02:23.390> somebody

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
natural wastage and I speak as somebody

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.050 
natural wastage and I speak as somebody
from<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.500> generation<00:02:24.709> as<00:02:25.310> well<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:26.030> all

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
from that generation as well so all

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.910 
from that generation as well so all
right<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.540> 20<00:02:26.870> years<00:02:26.989> time<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.410> may<00:02:27.530> not<00:02:27.680> have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
right in 20 years time you may not have

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.590 
right in 20 years time you may not have
those<00:02:28.520> sort<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.820> punters<00:02:29.150> still<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
those sort of punters still in the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.510 
those sort of punters still in the
betting<00:02:29.780> shops<00:02:30.110> but<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.410> think<00:02:30.739> they<00:02:31.220> will<00:02:31.430> have

I firmly say horses can make asses of
you<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.400> know<00:05:00.430> they<00:05:01.090> horses<00:05:02.020> aren't<00:05:02.200> humans

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
you you know they horses aren't humans

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.890 
you you know they horses aren't humans
and<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:03.310> but<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.730> humans<00:05:04.210> they<00:05:04.570> don't<00:05:04.780> do

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
and like but like humans they don't do

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.390
