00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 If you can't see it for tonight, don't do gentle eyes 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 My heart swayed when I decided that you were finished 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Hold me stronger than usual with that hand 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 After making a promise I will not show my tears 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 The bell on the phone keeps ringing I'm calling you 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Even if I give a quick reply, I can understand 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Before going to that person again 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I want you to say that I love you because I can lie 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Your afterglow drifting in a cold room alone 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 I slept while crying for blaming myself 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Such feelings that I do not want to be in love again 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Why so much the end is always the same 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.733
 I want you to say that I love you because I can lie again before I go to that person
