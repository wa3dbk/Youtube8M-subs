00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Phil Woods TRX2 customer since February 2011 Age 58 Norwood 3 

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.000
 About a year ago I noticed that I was starting to lose my hair. 

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:11.000
 I found it in the sink, in the shower, I found it on my brush, I found it on my pillow. 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.000
 It really started to bother me. 

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.000
 I noticed that I lost my hair right here, I started getting a receding hairline. 

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
 Well I wanted to nip that in the bud. 

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.000
 So I started a regime of foams, concealers, shampoos. 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.000
 Everything I could find at the drugstore that this nonsense would stop. 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.000
 Nothing seemed to work. 

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:40.000
 I went online, looked around, I found TRX2, it sounded fantastic, completely natural. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 You only take 3 capsules a day and things start to work for you, 

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.000
 all the science and background they are talking about, it all seemed logical, 

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.000
 but I do not quickly make a decision to order something online. 

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.000
 I am very skeptical about buying stuff online. 

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:58.000
 Some time later I happened to meet my friend Danny 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.000
 Danny and I grew up together. He always wore a hat on his head. 

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.000
 When I saw him, I asked, "Where is your hat?", He said, "I don't need him anymore." 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.000
 What do you mean you don't need it anymore? 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
 I'm not getting bald. Bald? 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.000
 To begin with, I had no idea you were bald. 

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.000
 That's because I was wearing a hat on my head. 

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.000
 What do you do to prevent it? He said: "I use TRX2" 

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:25.000
 Isn't that funny? I saw it online some time ago and I didn't want to experiment with it. 

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.000
 He said, "Experiment with it." Make the decision, buy it. He said, "It works for me" 

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.000
 So I did that. I bought it and about 5 to 6 months later 

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:40.000
 I happened to notice that my little coves started to fill up again, which is good news. 

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.000
 I have been taking it for about a year now. 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:48.000
 As you can see, this stuff works great. It is pretty well filled in. 

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:55.000
 A small side effect that I happened to notice is that a lot of the gray hair I had is also slowly disappearing. 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:02.000
 I'm not getting younger so it must be the TRX2, I suppose. 

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.000
 If you are losing your hair and you want to take a completely natural product. 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.000
 It's simple: 3 capsules a day and you're done. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 If that's what you want to do, I strongly recommend that you do it. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 It worked for me, I wouldn't know why it wouldn't work for you.
