00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
there and I believe you can do the same

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
there and I believe you can do the same
thing<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:28.920> doing<00:00:28.949> only<00:00:29.550> better<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
thing I'm doing only better for the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
thing I'm doing only better for the
videos<00:00:31.019> I'm<00:00:31.230> making<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.769> try<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.279> people

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
videos I'm making and try to get people

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
videos I'm making and try to get people
with<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> same<00:00:33.239> arena<00:00:33.540> rating<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:34.140> me<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
with the same arena rating with me or a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
with the same arena rating with me or a
little<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:35.100> higher<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.780> big

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
little bit higher but and this is a big

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.979 
little bit higher but and this is a big
but<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.620> believe<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.879> tactics<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.719> help

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
but I believe that my tactics can help

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.049 
but I believe that my tactics can help
by<00:00:40.200> pointing<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> should<00:00:41.340> act<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
by pointing the way you should act to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
by pointing the way you should act to
grant<00:00:42.329> yourself<00:00:42.809> some<00:00:43.170> leverage<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.860> your

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
grant yourself some leverage on your

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
grant yourself some leverage on your
opponent<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.450> necessarily<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
opponent this is not necessarily the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
opponent this is not necessarily the
best<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> act<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> works<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
best way to act but it works for me so I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020 
best way to act but it works for me so I
share<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> guys<00:00:49.340> how<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.730> better

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
share it with you guys how to get better

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
share it with you guys how to get better
if<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.570> may<00:00:51.750> ask<00:00:51.899> my<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:52.949> dueling<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.670> much

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
if you may ask my way is dueling as much

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
if you may ask my way is dueling as much
as<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.329> sense<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
as I can sense it's a good way to get to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.330 
as I can sense it's a good way to get to
know<00:00:56.399> other<00:00:56.670> classes<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> beat<00:00:58.050> them

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
know other classes and how to beat them

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
know other classes and how to beat them
how<00:00:59.340> they<00:00:59.670> play<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:00.660> capable<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
how they play what they're capable of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
how they play what they're capable of
when<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.949> burst<00:01:02.219> how<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> avoid<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.449> went

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
when they burst how to avoid it and went

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
when they burst how to avoid it and went
to<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> kill<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.680> tried<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> duel

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
