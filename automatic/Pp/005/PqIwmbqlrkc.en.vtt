00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.340
 a new acrobatics in minecraft you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.590
 they will wonder why I'm still alive after 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 of so many times that supposedly I've 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 dead with all the things that have me 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 happened in the previous tutorials 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.289
 today I will give you a little 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.320
 tutorial on how to backup in minecraft 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 it's something that we all by nature can 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 do so let them teach them the first 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.579
 step to answer is to be dead like this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 that as I always die when making a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.220
 tutorial I'm going to start doing one 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.040
 totally random for example 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.660
 how to buy things from Mr. Bobby is 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.820
 shit out I saw is a man that I 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.830
 I always buy him several items since 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.140
 their prices are the best in the market 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.420
 no doubt so let's proceed with the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.190
 tutorial we have here Mr. capo saw a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.350
 the ones you're going to take root so the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.830
 first step for this random tutorial 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.870
 is to have many moneys many moneys 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.300
 The second is to analyze the purchase of 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.300
 object we want to obtain in my case I 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.610
 I want that wooden bat wood which 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.220
 is at the low price of 100 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 one billion diamonds is undoubtedly 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.310
 a bargain now to complete the deal 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.360
 I will proceed to pay you the money 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.360
 we will begin to give for stacks 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.369
 six hours after the completion of the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.770
 payment will proceed to give us the product 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.930
 with which the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.509
 trade or a lot of attention here since in 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 this step is where I die ready and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.070
 yes, good is more 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.050
 the course 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.220
 finish 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.800
 I think that nothing happens after 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.260
 all 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.020
 good and we got to the tutorial part 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.970
 where I show them how to respond is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.310
 very simple once we died 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.760
 will appear a menu like this with two 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.470
 buttons we give to the one who says 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.700
 reappear and then reappear we have 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.700
 then let's give it 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.330
 it does not work 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.310
 He is not too late should have responded 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.140
 come good I can not let these 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 diamonds stay here in the open 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 I'll take them to styne ros this too 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.740
 one there is here
