00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
heat treated and unlike other cranks

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
heat treated and unlike other cranks
it's<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> how<00:00:50.940> other<00:00:51.390> tanks<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:51.989> don't

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199

called<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> pinch<00:00:55.829> bolt<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.930> it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
called the pinch bolt and it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.040 
called the pinch bolt and it's
integrated<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.949> can't<00:00:59.160> see

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
integrated so you really can't see

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.939 
integrated so you really can't see
compared<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> other<00:01:01.230> cranks<00:01:01.649> where<00:01:01.800> you'd

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
compared to other cranks where you'd

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.609 
compared to other cranks where you'd
have<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.489> um<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.750> stock<00:01:04.110> cranks<00:01:04.500> or

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
have like um these are stock cranks or

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.130 
have like um these are stock cranks or
here<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.270> freaking<00:01:06.750> bend<00:01:06.990> them

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
here and I did like freaking bend them

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
here and I did like freaking bend them
because<00:01:07.439> these<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.860> not<00:01:07.979> heated<00:01:08.189> treated<00:01:08.549> or

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
because these are not heated treated or

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.960 
because these are not heated treated or
anything<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.460> parts<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.700> heat<00:01:11.909> treated

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
anything so parts that are heat treated

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
anything so parts that are heat treated
they're<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.780> strong<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.260> heat<00:01:13.470> treated

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
they're not as strong as heat treated

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.240 
they're not as strong as heat treated
parts<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:16.140> guess<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.619> all
