long time since we have this out yeah

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.810 
long time since we have this out yeah
all<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.959> aftertaste<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.859> you<00:03:37.340> get<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.609> stop

all the aftertaste that you get the stop

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.580 
all the aftertaste that you get the stop
quality<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.450> aftertaste<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:39.140> was<00:03:39.440> the
