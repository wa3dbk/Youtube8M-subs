the<00:03:25.410> companion<00:03:25.920> audio<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:26.580> step<00:03:26.790> away

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
the companion audio I will step away

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.910 
the companion audio I will step away
from<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.210> computer<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.660> do<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.680> don't

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
from the computer to do this and don't

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.640

notice<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> difference<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.030> audio<00:03:30.750> quality<00:03:30.810> but

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
notice a difference in audio quality but

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.360 
notice a difference in audio quality but
maybe<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:33.320> borrow<00:03:34.320> more<00:03:34.740> power<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.250> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
maybe you can borrow more power to you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.460 
maybe you can borrow more power to you
again
