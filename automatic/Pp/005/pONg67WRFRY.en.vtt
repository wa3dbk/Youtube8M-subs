00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 recycled paper 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.150
 normally companies use 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.090
 paper making the manuals 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 nowadays there is so here it has to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.400
 Protect it, take it out here. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.450
 the headset is a handsome headset that 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.780
 micro soft to expo me here in the microphone 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 That I talked to the eraser over time. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 it will be drying up because he alone 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.200
 It ends up sounding like the river ends up sounding 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.570
 and in time it will dry up but it is 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.239
 normal but father does not work at all 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.920
 will continue to use r7 for years he 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.840
 works great, just take good care of yourself 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.930
 it's not down but joking 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.650
 enough my lord even today is clearer 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.200
 did not give us much here usb 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.900
 this is his will is usb then not 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.280
 noise usually gives 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.769
 cause of the sound card and such and the headset 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.470
 not very good but even in 7 good can 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.049
 make noise with it plug 3.5 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.049
 millimeters name each audio card 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.140
 even if it does not make noise here because usb 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.660
 here is a control of it can mutate your 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.780
 audio and increase volume joining here 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.239
 from the loud speaker and very cool this 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.950
 control is here that the film does not 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.230
 long but also not too short is a 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.620
 ideal size because I have a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:53.489
 headset here to the side and 77 of the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 elbit right his video phone is the 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.380
 fulham his cable is one of the two meters is 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.720

 This is the ideal size. 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.070
 Finally, as I mentioned the great advantage of 7 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.799
 a 15 brings excellent value for money is 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.540
 cheap and brings good audio quality 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.669
 in his mansion is a little too sharp 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.190
