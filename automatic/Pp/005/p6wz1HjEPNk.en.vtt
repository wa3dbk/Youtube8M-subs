00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.790
 today we are going to prepare the fried ones with 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.790
 french fries 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.960
 in this video we will see all the tricks 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.400
 to prepare some chips and 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.400
 new perfect fried 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.160
 we will use medium potatoes if the 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.230
 we cut manually first we would do 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.560
 some sheets of a centimeter of thickness 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.170
 and then we would cut them into strips 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.480
 option is used short potatoes is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.739
 very easy to use we put the potato 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.739
 in the guide and we press 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.760
 we can provide the touch of flavor 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.340
 adding a strip of pepper and a 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.190
 little onion we put to the fire a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 pan with plenty of olive oil 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.470
 when it's hot we put the onion 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.379
 and the pepper 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.900
 then we throw the potatoes what 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.960
 we will throw a lot of quantity since what 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.309
 want is to fry or sequenced 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.250
 we'll let it be done a couple of minutes 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 and when they take color we'll turn it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.909
 we will do this until all the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.219
 cookies 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.270
 at this point we drain them well and 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.270
 we remove to a source 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.610
 well we have the potatoes ready 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.280
 now we go with the eggs we have to 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.960
 use eggs at room temperature 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.550
 it is best to remove them a while before 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 the fridge to let the cold go 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.570
 we put on the fire a frying pan with a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.190
 jet of oil and a clove of garlic that 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.800
 it will give you flavor when it is hot 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.840
 we throw the eggs a trick so you do not 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.450
 break the yolk is to get closer 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 possible to the pan in this way 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.780
 we will also avoid splashing 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 we will let it grow larger in a fire 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 intermediate from 1 to 10 in 8 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.360
 we will help to make the clear by the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.880
 upper part 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.680
 pouring oil over the clear 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.990
 turning white as it goes 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.520
 curdling and once it's well curdled 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.320
 the clear we remove it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.329
 remember that before using the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 eggs you have to check if they are in 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.500
 good condition for this we put the eggs 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.569
 in containers with water the most 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.220
 fresh will remain in the background and those who 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.710
 float will have to be removed because it is 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.810
 normal 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.120
 and now we only have to enjoy this 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.120
 classic fried eggs with chips 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.900
 these are the ingredients that we have 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.700
