00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.240
 there is a very good attitude fuck is ok and 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.820
 commenting today I bring you another and mb this 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.619
 once trying the m-45 that also 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.210
 retouched in the last authorization of 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.970
 August like the Clean 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.519
 another day that I brought you with the here then 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.140
 it is a weapon that has increased the damage 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.640
 minimum 25% if I'm not wrong with 15 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.560
 the I do not remember but what does 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.780
 this before the bu killed me from afar 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.510
 of 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.019
 six shots already kill five then 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.300
 it's a thing that something close goes something 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.579
 better not the minimum damage up close either 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.039
 is very affected is most of all 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.930
 the scope of the weapon but good better 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.780
 not yet the minimum damage of the weapon then 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.579
 hear what is on the foot or whatever it is 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 you do more damage and now it's a weapon that 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.579
 goes relatively well especially when 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.570
 you put it science and reach or fire 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.190
 fast and loaders 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.940
 in this case it came with a silencer and 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.799
 chargers and you know that when you take out 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.660
 the specialist that is coming out all 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.970
 advantage then behind competitions 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.649
 of the weapon then having the range of 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.560
 coincidence with silencer and the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.530
 loaders well enough going 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.069
 better the weapon and it kills really well already 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.360
 you will see and here it kills you even from a shot 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.039
 I would obviously be touched, I told you 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.390
 which is a weapon that for competitive 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.710
 now you have to have it too much in 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.380
 account because 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.270
 it has enough damage the bad thing is that he 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 almost does not have cadences the bad thing the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.310
 weapon that has no cadence but has a 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.310
 heap of damage 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.840
 by far is he would be the best his rifle 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.280
 right now although the mp recoil 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.409
 It is very irregular but in terms of damage 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.030
 by far it would be the best his rifle would be 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.310
 a hybrid would not be more or less like a 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 mp7 now would be so good to far 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.020
 as good for close 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.909
 I could not compete with the mp 7 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.940
 because I do not know why but you need it 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.240
 we were xavi chasm is very good and it is not 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.240
 the same 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.690
 The reason is probably because the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 need has recoil up and 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.800
 not much and the summit has a setback 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.110
 sideways and a little weird then 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.900
 Well, I 'm telling you , it's not the weapon itself 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.860
 I came in with that does not imply that it's a 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.490
 full because I did not want either 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.750
 boring 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.160
 it was a gameplay after I got it 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.650
 they all fought after throwing fashion 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 very bored he was left alone one or two in 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.530
 the game so good as he pulled me 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.840
 the mufa killed a shorter pair of the network 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.280
 surely because or even as it has 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.830
 love directly cut the gameplay 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.600
 because you see already you will see how I 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.550
 they peel all the cable they stay only two 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.230
 or one and then more people have come in but 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.820
 it's not cool to not be half an hour watching 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.459
 a guy running with the hole that 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.269
 ported on the map then a is a love 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.370
 that same then the video the other day that 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.530
 like the clamor that I took 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.360
 With the old age that decides, it's me, 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 your summer that you play like that you always play 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 to sack because such as in this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.960
 example and not that he goes back to the map 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.630
 I'm going to the flag 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.620
 onion I'm changing what is 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.020
 that I like, I'm changing 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.810
 respawn and all without looking to notice that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.950
 they are born to me all of blow is going to make a 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.160
 triple a fiv 1234 I make a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.760
 quadruple fit a triple low and another more 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.260
 a quintuple fit is not cut or 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.000
 that has been a quintuple fisc the uom 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.140
 ep so you can see how bad it is in itself 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.460
 is bad and also through a 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.590
 veneer of the antennas 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.030
 is the best its possible regarding the subject 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
 of traversing surfaces too 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 then also another thing to have in 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.230
 account 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.900
 retains a lot of damage to the relationship 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.820
 surfaces of submachine guns that better 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.090
 crosses the one that crosses more then 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.220
 It is also necessary to keep this in mind 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.600
 what do you think about this surgery and 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.160
 many people that like me very much 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650
 either that I like too much I like it 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.739
 plus mp7 to pp 90 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.680
 the mp5 and the pm 9 I do not like more the em 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.879
 but good would be a middle ground from 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.379
 his rifle and the people who are 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.810
 used to playing with him I tell you 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.180
 that will go very well now with him 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 especially competitive in basic as 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.659
 hey is not the same as the competitive 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.129
 there are many competitive people play with 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.720
 the webs and now that they have improved 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.099
 quite well hey that this custom to 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.799
 play with her then she will go and you 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.269
 I say very well then why because 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.439
 I put muffler ask why the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.570
 silenced what it does is also lower 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.370
 a little backing then with all 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.989
 the powers of the weapon is to say the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.580
 muffler recoil reach already of 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.030
 carrying loaders as the weapon almost does not 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.030
 does it move 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.740
 It has enough range and I have a lot 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.750
 of bullets in the charger to spend 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.160
 then you will see as now in little in 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.960
 brief is not a voice too 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.370
 quick it took quite a while because I have to 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720
 to be looking for is all the time I'm not 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.330
 seeing I answered nothing by style like 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.340
 you see 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.770
 according to the moya, I tell you to cut 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.620
 the gameplay more than anything so I 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.870
 I say because it was very boring and it happened 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.090
 that you swallow a guy running around the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.919
 map all the time without killing anyone like that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.629
 that's good, so there's very little left 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.699
 the new pac and you see like a pair of drop 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.249
 shots I will look at the back quickly 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.009
 why 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.329
 they can do there it may seem that they do not 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.039
 but you can do there already explain it 

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:03.329
 map guide that you run the risk of 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.129
 that is not born in the dome if 

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.709
 someone goes into defeat even 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.089
 the media and their networks pound so much in 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.699
 cee as in eagerness to get out in both 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:13.559
 sides spread out so very attentive as 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.729
 I always say to the minimap and to look 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.350
 your back to me I was a 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.450
 little bit like that 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.860
 saying the dome again and we stopped and 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.330
 continue to do safely in the dome 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.280
 You see as little jumps as if 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.620
 they are there and I see another we shot him 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.570
 we give back the sheet and did not camp there 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.720
 inside that does not get hooked is born 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.790
 one on c2 we go for them 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.290
 there it is we kill another one up 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.520
 let's go for him 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.120
 they are doing a lot of 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.620
 people are escaping just enter to 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.940
 well abandoned part a few and 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.680
 also now as he studies the balance he 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.200
 See them all are playing with 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.990
 classmates this time was not the way 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.330
 mercenary as I always say we are with 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.980
 an existence and good as the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.930
 fashion can cut the job because no 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.270
 it's worth it since you see that when it falls 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.270
 the fashion went all the enemies already 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.660
 you see and they go two so good 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:10.450
 here pat me pim pam 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.010
 and then all those that were left 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.810
 the other one peels so well I hope that 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.830
 you will like gameplay that you do not vote for me 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.830
 like favorites and subscribe to another 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.830
 goodbye
