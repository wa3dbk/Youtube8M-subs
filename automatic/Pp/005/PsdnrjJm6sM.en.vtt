00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
playing storm but that could change

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.129 
playing storm but that could change
whether<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.910> full<00:00:15.210> burst<00:00:15.420> will<00:00:15.690> be<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:16.020> or

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
whether if full burst will be good or

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
whether if full burst will be good or
not<00:00:16.289> hopefully<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:16.980> they<00:00:17.130> fix<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
not hopefully if they fix some of the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.810 
not hopefully if they fix some of the
glitches<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.320> will<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.010> leave<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
glitches or will they just leave it and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.200 
glitches or will they just leave it and
act<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:22.529> fine<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:22.920> dandy

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
act as if it's all fine and dandy

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
act as if it's all fine and dandy
because<00:00:24.210> let's<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.810> honest<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.410> i'm<00:00:25.680> pretty

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
because let's be honest here i'm pretty

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.210 
because let's be honest here i'm pretty
sure<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.490> full<00:00:27.180> burst<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.650> contents

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
sure that full burst well the contents

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.519 
sure that full burst well the contents
of<00:00:29.310> full<00:00:29.550> burst<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:30.119> made<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.109> same<00:00:31.320> time

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
of full burst was made at the same time

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.250 
of full burst was made at the same time
as<00:00:31.590> original<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.660> pretty<00:00:33.809> much<00:00:33.899> say

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
as original so you can pretty much say

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.590 
as original so you can pretty much say
that<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> full<00:00:35.100> package<00:00:35.600> despite

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
that this is the full package despite

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
that this is the full package despite
there<00:00:36.840> being<00:00:36.890> characters<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.550> in

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
there being characters that are not in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.389 
there being characters that are not in

shit's still broken you know what that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
shit's still broken you know what that
tells<00:00:53.070> us<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.610> tells<00:00:53.910> us<00:00:54.210> cyberconnect2

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
tells us that tells us cyberconnect2

don't<00:00:55.739> give<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> flying<00:00:56.550> fuck<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.510> mean<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
don't give a flying fuck I mean if you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.319 
don't give a flying fuck I mean if you
think<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.370> paying<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.059> an

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
think about it we are paying for an

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.740 
think about it we are paying for an
update<00:01:00.960> let<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.590> sink<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.420> if

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
update let that sink in for a bit so if

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.700 
update let that sink in for a bit so if
we're<00:01:04.320> paying<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.189> update<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> patch

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
we're paying for an update or a patch

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.590 
we're paying for an update or a patch
naturally<00:01:07.710> you'd<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.520> fixes<00:01:08.970> bugs<00:01:09.240> as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
naturally you'd think it fixes bugs as

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
naturally you'd think it fixes bugs as
well<00:01:10.080> as<00:01:10.229> extra<00:01:10.740> content<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> reason<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> say

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
well as extra content the reason I say

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.719 
well as extra content the reason I say
update<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.320> actually

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
update is because they are actually

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
update is because they are actually
fixing<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> cutscenes<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:16.229> pretty<00:01:16.590> sure

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
fixing the cutscenes and I'm pretty sure

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
fixing the cutscenes and I'm pretty sure
everyone<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> forced<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> download<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
everyone will be forced to download a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.550 
everyone will be forced to download a
patch<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.430> order<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.119> storm<00:01:21.780> free<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> full

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
patch in order for storm free and full

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
patch in order for storm free and full
burst<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:23.549> together<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.840> who

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
burst to work together for those who

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.050 
burst to work together for those who
don't<00:01:25.110> buy<00:01:25.710> full<00:01:26.009> burst<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> still

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
don't buy full burst so they can still

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
don't buy full burst so they can still
play<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.450> people<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.530> original

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
play with people that have the original

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
play with people that have the original
storm<00:01:29.310> free<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.150> pretty<00:01:30.390> sure<00:01:30.540> it'll<00:01:30.960> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
storm free so I'm pretty sure it'll be

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
storm free so I'm pretty sure it'll be
mandatory<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.770> everyone<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> download<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
mandatory for everyone to download the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.390 
mandatory for everyone to download the
patch<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.840> wouldn't<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
patch so wouldn't this be a good time to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420 
patch so wouldn't this be a good time to
give<00:01:36.119> us<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.810> update<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.680> something

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
give us a little update or something

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.620 
give us a little update or something
because<00:01:38.579> when's<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> last<00:01:39.450> time

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because when's the last time

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
because when's the last time
cyberconnect2<00:01:40.350> gave<00:01:40.890> us<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.220> update<00:01:41.640> on

fixing something never now that kind of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
fixing something never now that kind of
leads<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> believe<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.250> not

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
leads me to believe that we are not

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
leads me to believe that we are not
going<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.030> fix<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> bugs<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.259> this
