00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
you have several that are large then you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
you have several that are large then you
can<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.850> can<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.450> different<00:02:26.660> ones<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.170> that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
can you can do different ones but that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600 
can you can do different ones but that
when<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:27.500> start<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.220> one<00:02:28.459> goes

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.070 
when I start with and that one goes
straight<00:02:29.470> just<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.130> then<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:32.080> just

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
straight just like that and then I just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.140 
straight just like that and then I just
start<00:02:33.260> choosing<00:02:33.709> ribbons<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.850> start

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
other ribbons and then I'll finish this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.390 
other ribbons and then I'll finish this
and<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.180> kind<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.709> pick<00:02:48.709> another<00:02:48.950> ribbon

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.040 

lay<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.550> over<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.360> you're<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.989> to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
lay it over and you're just going to

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.410 
lay it over and you're just going to
basically<00:02:54.170> make<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.650> giant<00:02:55.040> asterisk<00:02:55.459> out<00:02:55.850> of

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
basically make a giant asterisk out of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990 
basically make a giant asterisk out of
ribbon<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.340> pretty<00:02:58.489> much<00:02:58.640> lay<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.940> out

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
ribbon so you can pretty much lay it out

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.509 
ribbon so you can pretty much lay it out
any<00:02:59.180> way<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.390> want<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.810> I<00:03:00.110> do<00:03:00.530> suggest<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.310> if

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
any way you want to I do suggest that if

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.490 
any way you want to I do suggest that if
you're<00:03:01.670> making<00:03:01.910> two<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.420> these<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:03.050> pigtails

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you're making two of these for pigtails

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.199 
you're making two of these for pigtails
you<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.160> at<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> same<00:03:04.640> time<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.180> that

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
you do this at the same time so that

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.720 
you do this at the same time so that
they<00:03:05.840> look<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.260> same<00:03:06.290> I've<00:03:06.830> done<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.519> before

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
they look the same I've done it before

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.370 
they look the same I've done it before
I've<00:03:08.090> tried<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> copy<00:03:08.660> myself<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.320> that's

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
I've tried to copy myself and that's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.830 
I've tried to copy myself and that's
really<00:03:09.830> hard<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.100> do<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.459> then<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.300> next<00:03:11.600> step

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
really hard to do and then the next step

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.490 
really hard to do and then the next step
is<00:03:12.050> optional<00:03:12.580> but<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.780> going<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> be<00:03:15.170> if

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
is optional but if you're going to be if

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.810
