going to just hit upon some important
aspects<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.140> breaking<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.739> brand<00:00:59.010> new<00:00:59.160> engine

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
aspects of breaking a brand new engine

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.180 
aspects of breaking a brand new engine
in<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> brand<00:01:00.359> new<00:01:00.420> Saito<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.230> we're

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
in we got a brand new Saito and we're

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
in we got a brand new Saito and we're
gonna<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> shop<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.570> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
gonna start here in the shop and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.150 
gonna start here in the shop and then
we're<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.080> her<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> field<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
we're gonna take her out to the field so

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.010 
we're gonna take her out to the field so
just<00:01:05.519> stay<00:01:05.700> tuned<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> run<00:01:06.840> out

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
just stay tuned you get to see a run out

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.109 
just stay tuned you get to see a run out
there<00:01:07.289> but<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.399> very<00:01:08.520> important<00:01:08.970> if<00:01:09.060> we

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
there but it's very important if we

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
there but it's very important if we
break<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:09.450> engine<00:01:09.810> properly<00:01:10.679> we<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.009> a<00:01:11.039> lot

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.669 
break this engine properly we have a lot
of<00:01:11.429> metal<00:01:11.729> parts<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.539> need<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> mesh

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679

our muffler is nice and tight our nice
little<00:01:44.009> spark<00:01:44.430> plug<00:01:44.729> we've<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> nice

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
little spark plug we've got that nice

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.440 
little spark plug we've got that nice
and<00:01:45.810> tight<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.189> big<00:01:47.729> factor<00:01:48.210> when

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and tight and then a big factor when

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
and tight and then a big factor when
building<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> Mojo<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.649> me<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
building the Mojo for me was is that

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.870 
building the Mojo for me was is that
this<00:01:50.700> engine<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.479> took<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
this engine I took this off and on the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
this engine I took this off and on the
airframe<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.079> many<00:01:55.320> times

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
airframe here many times

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
airframe here many times
this<00:01:56.640> engine<00:01:57.000> sat<00:01:57.210> around<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> work<00:01:57.869> table

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this engine sat around on the work table

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.859 
this engine sat around on the work table
so<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.680> did<00:01:59.310> accumulate<00:01:59.939> probably<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.600> dust

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so it did accumulate probably some dust

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.620 
so it did accumulate probably some dust
maybe<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.500> dirt<00:02:01.710> inside<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.450> will

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
maybe some dirt inside of it so we will

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.170 
maybe some dirt inside of it so we will
take<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.640> first<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:05.939> we'll

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
take that out and the first thing we'll

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.539 
take that out and the first thing we'll
do<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.360> we'll<00:02:06.719> flush<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.560> nice<00:02:07.740> fuel

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
do is we'll flush it with some nice fuel

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.060 
do is we'll flush it with some nice fuel
here<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.090> flush<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.570> out<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.920> we'll

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
here and flush that out and then we'll

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.430 
here and flush that out and then we'll
come<00:02:11.220> back<00:02:11.430> through<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:13.019> we're<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.290> add

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
come back through and we're going to add

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.979 
come back through and we're going to add
a<00:02:13.470> couple<00:02:13.709> drops<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.730> after<00:02:15.420> runnel

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
a couple drops of after runnel

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.920 
a couple drops of after runnel
and<00:02:16.700> we'll<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> couple<00:02:18.180> drops<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.570> oil<00:02:18.690> in

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and we'll put a couple drops of oil in

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
and we'll put a couple drops of oil in
there<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.620> when<00:02:19.799> we<00:02:19.829> crank<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.340> over<00:02:20.579> for<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
there so when we crank that over for the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.699 
there so when we crank that over for the
first<00:02:21.090> time<00:02:21.299> we've<00:02:21.510> got<00:02:21.630> some<00:02:21.840> lubrication<00:02:22.350> in
