00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
a plant based food that's low in

a plant based food that's low in

calories low in fat high in protein and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.700 
calories low in fat high in protein and
packed<00:00:19.939> with<00:00:20.210> nutrients<00:00:20.660> not<00:00:21.349> to<00:00:21.529> mention

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
packed with nutrients not to mention

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.679 
packed with nutrients not to mention
it's<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.070> great<00:00:22.460> source<00:00:22.880> of<00:00:23.090> soluble<00:00:23.630> fiber

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's a great source of soluble fiber

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.660 
it's a great source of soluble fiber
which<00:00:24.380> literally<00:00:24.710> helps<00:00:25.279> to<00:00:25.490> lower

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
which literally helps to lower

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.939 
which literally helps to lower
cholesterol<00:00:26.029> levels<00:00:26.470> think<00:00:27.470> of<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:27.650> like<00:00:27.769> this

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
cholesterol levels think of it like this

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.120 
cholesterol levels think of it like this
when<00:00:28.580> soluble<00:00:29.119> fiber<00:00:29.419> mixes<00:00:30.289> with<00:00:30.410> water<00:00:30.439> it

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
when soluble fiber mixes with water it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.220 
when soluble fiber mixes with water it
creates<00:00:31.490> this<00:00:31.699> thick<00:00:32.119> gelatinous<00:00:32.360> mixture

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
creates this thick gelatinous mixture

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.229 
creates this thick gelatinous mixture
and<00:00:33.469> as<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.010> mixture<00:00:34.370> works<00:00:34.789> its<00:00:35.059> way

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
and as that mixture works its way

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.450 
and as that mixture works its way
through<00:00:35.270> your<00:00:35.539> body<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:36.140> literally<00:00:37.010> pulls

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
through your body it literally pulls

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.610 
through your body it literally pulls
cholesterol<00:00:38.210> along<00:00:38.450> with<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:38.989> this<00:00:39.379> really

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
cholesterol along with it so this really

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.229 
cholesterol along with it so this really
is<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:39.890> food<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.430> want<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.850> make<00:00:40.969> part<00:00:41.210> of

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
is a food that you want to make part of

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.459 
is a food that you want to make part of
your<00:00:41.390> diet<00:00:41.570> there's<00:00:42.050> several<00:00:42.320> different

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
your diet there's several different

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.650 
your diet there's several different
types<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.370> oatmeal<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:44.270> thought<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:44.600> would

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
types of oatmeal so I thought it would

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.970 
types of oatmeal so I thought it would
be<00:00:44.780> helpful<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.230> just<00:00:45.320> explain<00:00:45.859> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
be helpful to just explain the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.650 
be helpful to just explain the
differences<00:00:46.399> between<00:00:46.550> them<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.420> let's<00:00:47.600> go

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
differences between them so let's go

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.270 
differences between them so let's go
ahead<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.930> break<00:00:48.079> them<00:00:48.230> down<00:00:48.260> at<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.859> top<00:00:49.129> of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
ahead and break them down at the top of

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.340 
ahead and break them down at the top of
the<00:00:49.370> chart<00:00:49.579> we<00:00:49.730> have<00:00:49.760> oak<00:00:50.180> growths<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.050> Oh

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
the chart we have oak growths now Oh

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.160 
the chart we have oak growths now Oh
quotes<00:00:51.829> are<00:00:52.070> basically<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.300> whole<00:00:53.539> oat<00:00:53.840> with

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
quotes are basically the whole oat with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.650 
quotes are basically the whole oat with
the<00:00:54.320> husk<00:00:54.590> removed<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:55.670> there<00:00:55.850> are<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.359> least

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
the husk removed so there are the least

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.770 
the husk removed so there are the least
processed<00:00:57.170> form<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:58.010> oatmeal<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:59.480> they're<00:00:59.750> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
processed form of oatmeal and they're a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.630 
processed form of oatmeal and they're a
little<00:00:59.960> bit<00:01:00.170> cheaper<00:01:00.469> than<00:01:00.500> regular<00:01:00.769> oats<00:01:01.129> but

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
little bit cheaper than regular oats but

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.040 
little bit cheaper than regular oats but
they<00:01:01.820> do<00:01:01.879> take<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.300> longest<00:01:02.570> to<00:01:02.690> cook<00:01:02.719> they

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
they do take the longest to cook they

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.649 
they do take the longest to cook they
take<00:01:03.230> about<00:01:03.379> 45<00:01:03.920> minutes<00:01:04.400> or<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.330> when<00:01:05.630> you

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
take about 45 minutes or so and when you

they're cooked up they look just like a
grain<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.100> rice<00:01:16.220> next<00:01:17.180> up<00:01:17.329> we<00:01:17.600> have<00:01:17.630> steel-cut

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
grain of rice next up we have steel-cut

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.230 
grain of rice next up we have steel-cut
oats<00:01:18.560> which<00:01:19.100> just<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:19.579> happened<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:19.939> be<00:01:20.060> my

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
oats which just so happened to be my

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.050 
oats which just so happened to be my
personal<00:01:20.900> favorite<00:01:21.320> now<00:01:21.829> all<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.579> steel-cut

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
personal favorite now all the steel-cut

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.410 
personal favorite now all the steel-cut
oat<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.270> is<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.140> oak<00:01:24.409> grow<00:01:24.799> cut<00:01:25.460> into<00:01:26.090> two<00:01:26.270> or

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
oat is is the oak grow cut into two or

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.510 
oat is is the oak grow cut into two or
three<00:01:26.450> smaller<00:01:27.020> pieces<00:01:27.320> with<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> steel<00:01:28.220> blade

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
three smaller pieces with a steel blade

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.240 
three smaller pieces with a steel blade
so<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:29.450> still<00:01:29.720> very<00:01:29.750> close<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.680> its<00:01:30.799> natural

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so it's still very close to its natural

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.310 
so it's still very close to its natural
state<00:01:31.430> but<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.149> takes<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.450> little<00:01:32.659> less<00:01:32.990> time<00:01:33.290> to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
state but it takes a little less time to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.410 
state but it takes a little less time to
cook<00:01:33.770> than<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.520> oak<00:01:34.640> Grove's<00:01:35.000> these<00:01:35.299> are

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
cook than the oak Grove's these are

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.270 
cook than the oak Grove's these are
going<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.630> take<00:01:35.750> about<00:01:35.869> 25<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.680> 30<00:01:36.890> minutes<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
going to take about 25 to 30 minutes to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.219 
going to take about 25 to 30 minutes to
cook<00:01:37.460> up<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.270> what<00:01:38.420> you<00:01:38.540> do<00:01:38.659> want<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:38.930> keep<00:01:39.079> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
cook up now what you do want to keep in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.649 
cook up now what you do want to keep in
mind<00:01:39.470> with<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.740> steel-cut<00:01:40.220> oat<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:41.180> they

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
mind with the steel-cut oat is that they

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.120 
mind with the steel-cut oat is that they
don't<00:01:41.930> work<00:01:42.079> well<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.470> microwave<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.040> you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
don't work well in the microwave and you

then we've got rolled oats which are

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.550 
then we've got rolled oats which are
sometimes<00:01:55.850> called<00:01:56.119> old-fashioned<00:01:56.990> oats<00:01:57.110> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
all that I rolled though is is the old

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.980 
all that I rolled though is is the old
throat<00:02:00.020> that's<00:02:00.860> been<00:02:01.100> steamed<00:02:01.750> rolled<00:02:02.750> out

steamed<00:02:03.950> again<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.579> then<00:02:04.909> toast<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.140> while

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
steamed again and then toast it so while

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.959 
steamed again and then toast it so while
it<00:02:06.770> does<00:02:06.799> undergo<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.369> little<00:02:07.670> bit<00:02:07.789> more

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969

of that is is the roll dough that's been

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.930 
of that is is the roll dough that's been
pretty<00:02:34.530> cooked<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.860> little<00:02:34.980> bit<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.760> once

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
pretty cooked a little bit so that once

now<00:02:38.150> personally<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> prefer<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.750> stick

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
now personally I prefer to just stick

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.839 
now personally I prefer to just stick
with<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.319> rolled<00:02:40.530> oat<00:02:40.739> because<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
with the rolled oat because for the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.610 
with the rolled oat because for the
extra<00:02:42.150> minute<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> takes<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.019> cook<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.349> think

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
extra minute it takes to cook I think

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.130 
extra minute it takes to cook I think
the<00:02:43.709> flavor<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.159> lot<00:02:44.549> better<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.390> only<00:02:45.900> type

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the flavor is a lot better the only type

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.410 
the flavor is a lot better the only type
of<00:02:46.170> oatmeal<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.799> wouldn't<00:02:47.340> recommend<00:02:47.700> are

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of oatmeal that I wouldn't recommend are

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.089 
of oatmeal that I wouldn't recommend are
those<00:02:48.599> little<00:02:48.930> instant<00:02:49.379> pre<00:02:49.650> flavored

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
those little instant pre flavored

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.550 
those little instant pre flavored
baggies<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.670> they<00:02:50.819> sell<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.959> problem<00:02:52.349> there

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
baggies that they sell the problem there

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830 
baggies that they sell the problem there
is<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.799> not<00:02:53.579> only<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.150> more<00:02:54.329> expensive

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
is that not only are they more expensive

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.289 
is that not only are they more expensive
but<00:02:55.409> they<00:02:55.709> tend<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.220> packed<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:56.970> sugar

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
but they tend to be packed with sugar

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.300 
but they tend to be packed with sugar
I've<00:02:57.900> seen<00:02:58.200> some<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> those<00:02:58.620> babies<00:02:58.859> having

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
I've seen some of those babies having

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.729 
I've seen some of those babies having
upwards<00:02:59.790> of<00:03:00.030> 15<00:03:00.629> grams<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.200> sugar<00:03:01.440> per<00:03:01.709> serving

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
upwards of 15 grams of sugar per serving

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.000 
upwards of 15 grams of sugar per serving
and<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:03.000> got<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.299> remember<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:04.230> teaspoon<00:03:04.859> of

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and you got to remember one teaspoon of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.240 
and you got to remember one teaspoon of
sugar<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.819> equivalent<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> four<00:03:06.780> grams<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.650> 15

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
sugar is equivalent to four grams so 15

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.069 
sugar is equivalent to four grams so 15
grams<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.790> way<00:03:09.150> more<00:03:09.599> than<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.900> would<00:03:10.049> ever

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
grams is way more than you would ever

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.199 
grams is way more than you would ever
voluntarily<00:03:11.040> add<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.489> your<00:03:11.609> oatmeal<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> your

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
voluntarily add to your oatmeal on your

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.020 
voluntarily add to your oatmeal on your
own<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.170> you're<00:03:13.319> much<00:03:13.590> better<00:03:13.889> off<00:03:13.950> buying<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
own so you're much better off buying the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.119 
own so you're much better off buying the
plain<00:03:15.329> regular<00:03:15.569> oats<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.139> then<00:03:16.470> flavoring<00:03:17.010> it

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
plain regular oats and then flavoring it

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.830 
plain regular oats and then flavoring it
yourself<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.940> now<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.239> you've<00:03:18.540> got<00:03:18.690> the
