people this is probably their only time
here<00:02:05.840> what<00:02:06.320> do<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.470> tell<00:02:06.710> them<00:02:06.920> about<00:02:06.979> this

here what do you tell them about this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.770 
here what do you tell them about this
one<00:02:07.310> it's<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.490> mass<00:02:07.700> start<00:02:08.030> mass<00:02:08.390> start<00:02:08.660> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
one it's a mass start mass start is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.270 
one it's a mass start mass start is
always<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> lot<00:02:09.259> scarier<00:02:09.590> than<00:02:09.769> wave<00:02:09.979> stones

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
always a lot scarier than wave stones

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640 
always a lot scarier than wave stones
right<00:02:10.519> yeah<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.789> swim<00:02:11.000> start<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.300> have<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.650> big

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
right yeah the swim start we have a big

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.330 
right yeah the swim start we have a big
bay<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.610> think<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.940> lot<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.209> people<00:02:14.450> tend<00:02:14.690> to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
bay and I think a lot of people tend to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.640 
bay and I think a lot of people tend to
to<00:02:16.340> start<00:02:16.819> towards<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.420> pier<00:02:17.750> yeah<00:02:18.080> which<00:02:18.620> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
to start towards the pier yeah which is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.350 
to start towards the pier yeah which is
a<00:02:18.800> straight<00:02:19.160> line<00:02:19.370> down<00:02:19.730> all<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> buoy

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
a straight line down all of the buoy

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.699 
a straight line down all of the buoy
lines<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.019> really<00:02:21.200> only<00:02:21.319> have<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.590> go

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
lines but you really only have to go

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.229 
lines but you really only have to go
around<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> turn<00:02:22.310> buoy<00:02:22.549> but<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:22.910> everyone's

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
around the turn buoy but if everyone's

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.330 
around the turn buoy but if everyone's
compiled<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.049> area<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.650> don't

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
compiled in one area you don't

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.130 
compiled in one area you don't

point<00:02:48.769> also<00:02:49.489> though<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.090> swim<00:02:50.329> start

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
point also though because the swim start

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.270 
point also though because the swim start
is<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:50.810> wide<00:02:51.019> don't<00:02:51.680> start<00:02:51.920> at<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.040> piers

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
is so wide don't start at the piers

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.270 
is so wide don't start at the piers
start<00:02:52.820> down<00:02:53.090> towards<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.810> rocks<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:55.160> know

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
start down towards the rocks you know

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.770 
start down towards the rocks you know
you<00:02:55.820> don't<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.239> up<00:02:56.359> against<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
you don't want to go up against the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.630 
you don't want to go up against the
rocks<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.320> all<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.650> room<00:02:57.950> to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
rocks but you have all that room to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.009 
rocks but you have all that room to
where<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.880> can<00:02:59.000> still<00:02:59.209> swim<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.630> shallows

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
where you can still swim in the shallows

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.660 
where you can still swim in the shallows
and<00:03:00.170> sometimes<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.739> current<00:03:01.160> in<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.280> area

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
and sometimes that current in that area

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.300 
and sometimes that current in that area
will<00:03:01.790> actually<00:03:02.120> pull<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.900> along<00:03:03.130> faster<00:03:04.130> than

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
will actually pull you along faster than

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.370 
will actually pull you along faster than
if<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.489> start<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.359> deep<00:03:05.540> area<00:03:05.720> right<00:03:06.019> next

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
if you start in the deep area right next

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.259 
if you start in the deep area right next
to<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.530> pier<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.980> know<00:03:07.489> one<00:03:07.670> year<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> think<00:03:08.209> it

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
to the pier you know one year I think it

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.050 
to the pier you know one year I think it
was<00:03:08.359> just<00:03:08.540> an<00:03:08.720> eco<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.350> myself<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.160> we<00:03:10.730> swam

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
was just an eco and myself and we swam

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.509 
was just an eco and myself and we swam
by<00:03:11.900> ourselves<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.620> shallows<00:03:13.010> until<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
by ourselves and the shallows until the

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.800 
by ourselves and the shallows until the
turn<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:13.970> met<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> group<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.630> turn

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
turn and we met the group of the turn

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.270 
turn and we met the group of the turn
and<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.049> were<00:03:15.140> in<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.320> front<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.130> made

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
and we were in the front and so it made

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.160 
and we were in the front and so it made
it<00:03:16.370> easy<00:03:16.549> that<00:03:16.850> we<00:03:16.940> didn't<00:03:17.120> have<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.299> fight<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it easy that we didn't have to fight to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.349 
it easy that we didn't have to fight to
gain<00:03:18.350> feet<00:03:18.799> or<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.070> find<00:03:19.280> areas<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:19.850> line

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
gain feet or to find areas so line

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.240 
gain feet or to find areas so line
yourself<00:03:20.600> up<00:03:20.900> accordingly<00:03:21.380> look<00:03:21.890> for<00:03:22.070> clean
