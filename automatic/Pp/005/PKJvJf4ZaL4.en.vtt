but I visited obviously the touchscreen

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
but I visited obviously the touchscreen
interface<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.820> huge<00:01:54.150> improvement<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.660> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
interface is a huge improvement to the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.850 
interface is a huge improvement to the
operating<00:01:55.140> system<00:01:55.260> right

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
operating system right

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
operating system right
but<00:01:56.010> his<00:01:56.100> hardware<00:01:56.460> based<00:01:56.610> answers<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.390> HP

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but his hardware based answers from HP

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.330 
but his hardware based answers from HP
versus<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.650> Microsoft<00:01:59.010> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> big

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
versus you know and Microsoft is a big

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:14.530 
versus you know and Microsoft is a big
bed<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> hardware<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:01.830> developer<00:02:13.430> so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
bed the hardware is a developer so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.990 
bed the hardware is a developer so
developers<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.950> do<00:02:16.950> whatever<00:02:17.100> I'll<00:02:17.280> really

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
developers can do whatever I'll really

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.090 
developers can do whatever I'll really
and<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.750> find<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.020> pretty<00:02:19.260> easy<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.560> develop

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and you find it pretty easy to develop

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.740 
and you find it pretty easy to develop
further<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.610> applicator<00:02:21.000> he's<00:02:21.360> pursued

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
further for this applicator he's pursued
