by<00:03:17.129> me<00:03:17.370> moisturizing<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.660> every

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
by me moisturizing like this every

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.949 
by me moisturizing like this every
single<00:03:19.410> day<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:20.550> prevents<00:03:21.239> me<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.780> getting

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
single day this prevents me for getting

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.440 
single day this prevents me for getting
single<00:03:22.769> strand<00:03:23.160> knots<00:03:23.250> because<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:24.000> really

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
single strand knots because I really

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.640 
single strand knots because I really
don't<00:03:24.629> get<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.780> lot<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.959> single<00:03:25.230> strand<00:03:25.560> knots

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
don't get a lot of single strand knots

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.080 
don't get a lot of single strand knots
at<00:03:26.190> all<00:03:26.370> i<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:27.019> tangles<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:29.310> not<00:03:29.549> single

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

at all i get tangles but not single
strand<00:03:30.330> knots<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.780> i<00:03:30.840> really<00:03:31.379> think<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
strand knots and i really think that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.809 
strand knots and i really think that
this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.790> reason<00:03:32.970> why<00:03:33.150> i<00:03:33.269> don't<00:03:33.629> get<00:03:33.810> them

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819
