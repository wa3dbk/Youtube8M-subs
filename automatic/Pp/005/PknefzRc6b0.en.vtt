think<00:05:15.270> we're<00:05:15.390> getting<00:05:15.450> chances<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.110> think

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
think we're getting chances and I think

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.210 
think we're getting chances and I think
we're<00:05:16.410> getting<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.770> we're<00:05:17.070> getting

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
we're getting a we're getting

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.530 
we're getting a we're getting
opportunities<00:05:17.490> square<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:18.240> it's<00:05:18.330> just<00:05:18.450> a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
opportunities square I think it's just a

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.990 
opportunities square I think it's just a
matter<00:05:18.630> of<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.980> about<00:05:19.980> capitalizing<00:05:20.370> on<00:05:20.670> it<00:05:20.880> and

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
matter of a about capitalizing on it and

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.460 
matter of a about capitalizing on it and
you<00:05:21.060> know<00:05:21.090> maybe<00:05:21.330> just<00:05:21.570> getting<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.380> know

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
you know maybe just getting you know

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.080 
you know maybe just getting you know
they<00:05:22.590> block<00:05:22.980> they<00:05:23.130> box<00:05:23.370> out<00:05:23.520> pretty<00:05:23.700> well<00:05:23.790> but

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
they block they box out pretty well but

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.490 
they block they box out pretty well but
I<00:05:24.330> think<00:05:24.510> we<00:05:24.690> just<00:05:24.720> got<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.020> get<00:05:25.080> around<00:05:25.290> them

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
I think we just got to get around them

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.990 
I think we just got to get around them
work<00:05:25.680> our<00:05:25.800> hardest<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:26.400> get<00:05:26.550> around<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:26.910> maybe

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
work our hardest to get around and maybe

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.970 
work our hardest to get around and maybe
even<00:05:27.210> drop<00:05:27.450> alaniz<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.020> no<00:05:28.530> get<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.830> power

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
even drop alaniz and no get that power

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.040
