world Jamie wants to be able to ride
waves<00:01:32.259> with<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.649> board<00:01:32.890> but<00:01:33.579> he<00:01:33.670> also<00:01:33.850> wants

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
waves with the board but he also wants

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.539 
waves with the board but he also wants
paddling<00:01:34.780> efficiency<00:01:35.439> in<00:01:35.649> Glide

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
paddling efficiency in Glide

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.789 
paddling efficiency in Glide
you<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.819> a<00:01:36.880> narrower<00:01:37.299> entry<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.619> have<00:01:38.649> a

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
you have a narrower entry you have a

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.830 
you have a narrower entry you have a
lower<00:01:39.069> rocker<00:01:39.429> in<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.819> front<00:01:40.210> which<00:01:40.539> allows

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
lower rocker in the front which allows

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.719 
lower rocker in the front which allows
the<00:01:41.110> water<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.500> bend<00:01:41.860> down<00:01:42.009> underneath<00:01:42.429> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the water to bend down underneath the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.850 
the water to bend down underneath the
board<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.750> allows<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.380> board<00:01:44.619> to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
board and that allows the board to

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.730 
board and that allows the board to
continue<00:01:45.250> gliding<00:01:45.939> after<00:01:46.689> each<00:01:46.869> stroke<00:01:47.289> you

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
continue gliding after each stroke you

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.709 
continue gliding after each stroke you
can<00:01:47.770> see<00:01:48.069> the<00:01:48.189> light<00:01:48.369> concave<00:01:48.969> going<00:01:49.479> through

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
can see the light concave going through

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.999 
can see the light concave going through
there<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.289> then<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.099> just<00:01:51.250> progresses<00:01:51.909> up<00:01:52.149> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
there and then it just progresses up to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.949 
there and then it just progresses up to
exactly<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.369> middle<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.729> board<00:01:55.030> where

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
exactly the middle of the board where

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.260 
exactly the middle of the board where
Jamie<00:01:56.229> would<00:01:56.530> stand<00:01:56.829> is<00:01:57.340> still<00:01:57.700> perfectly

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
Jamie would stand is still perfectly

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.929 
Jamie would stand is still perfectly
flat<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.470> that's<00:01:59.770> what<00:02:00.220> gives<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.729> board

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
flat and so that's what gives the board

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.359 
flat and so that's what gives the board
stability<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:02.649> know<00:02:02.739> right<00:02:03.009> in<00:02:03.220> this

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
stability you know right in this

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.359 
stability you know right in this
midsection<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:05.110> right<00:02:05.590> here<00:02:05.619> which<00:02:06.159> is

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
midsection and then right here which is

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.100 
midsection and then right here which is
would<00:02:07.030> represent<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:09.700> between<00:02:10.209> where<00:02:10.630> his<00:02:10.840> two

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
would represent in between where his two

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.500 
would represent in between where his two
feet<00:02:11.380> would<00:02:11.590> be<00:02:11.769> one<00:02:12.130> back<00:02:12.400> here<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.060> one<00:02:13.299> up

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
feet would be one back here and one up

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.080 
feet would be one back here and one up
here<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.500> peak<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.920> V<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.910> your

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
here is the peak of the V this is your

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.210 
here is the peak of the V this is your
power-steering<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.829> takes<00:02:18.069> a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
power-steering this is what takes a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.339 
power-steering this is what takes a
board<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.790> size<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.630> width<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
board of this size and this width and

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.050 
board of this size and this width and
allows<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.130> when<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.400> drop<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.940> bottom

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
allows you when you drop to the bottom

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900 
allows you when you drop to the bottom
of<00:02:22.359> a<00:02:22.480> wave<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:23.019> lay<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.160> board<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.609> get<00:02:24.790> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
of a wave to lay that board and get it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.539 
of a wave to lay that board and get it
onto<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.269> rail<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.989> then<00:02:26.560> pull<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.100> up<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> face

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
onto a rail and then pull it up the face

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.670 
onto a rail and then pull it up the face
of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> wave<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.630> board<00:02:28.959> being<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.410> little

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
of the wave this board being a little

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.229 
of the wave this board being a little
sleeker<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.940> little<00:02:31.660> faster<00:02:32.579> easier<00:02:33.579> to<00:02:33.940> paddle

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
sleeker a little faster easier to paddle

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.229 
sleeker a little faster easier to paddle
and<00:02:34.600> maintain<00:02:35.079> glide<00:02:35.410> for<00:02:35.799> its<00:02:35.950> length<00:02:36.250> those

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
and maintain glide for its length those

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.390 
and maintain glide for its length those
are<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:37.600> things<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.170> Jamie<00:02:38.920> wanted

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
are all things that Jamie wanted

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.690 
are all things that Jamie wanted
designed<00:02:39.850> into<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.329> board
