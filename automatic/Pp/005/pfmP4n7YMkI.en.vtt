00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
What were some surprising things when you went to a public bathhouse?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.760
Enes: That you had to strip everything.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.800
Wait, of course you take off everything. Do you not do that in your countries?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.280
E: In Turkey, we never go in all-nude.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
Daniel: But you tie a towel.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.380
E: We have this thin clothing, towel-sized, and we cover up from bellybutton to knees and just wash like that.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.840
Guillame: I went with some really close friends, and they were chill and acted the same way they normally do.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.780
But I felt a bit shy so I didn't make much eye contact or talk that much.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.300
You should look them in the eye! It's weirder if you don't.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.980
G: But I'd never done something like that before, besides my brother and my dad, I guess.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.340
In Korean bathhouses, there's always a guy sleeping at the edge of the bathtub.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.480
(sub: 'I know what you mean')

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.120
He has his arms stretched out like this.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.540
Robin: There's people exercising too.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.440
Oh yes, there is.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.700
R: Like squats and stuff.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.140
Alberto: There was this man who was sleeping in front of my locker, completely naked.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.060
A: I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wake him, or...

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.240
Julien: I was drying my hair,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.360
and I saw this guy next to me and he was like, using the hair dryer on his,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.480
you know, that part, like, intensely.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.720
(The importance of waxing.) Yeah.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600
It usually says, like,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.220
'Don't use it for other (?) purposes.'

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.360
J: Honestly, I kinda liked it. Even at home when I tried it.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400
Sam: What I found funny was, I got out of the shower

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.920
and there was this kid with his dad as I was getting dressed.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.640
And the kid just went like this:

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.920
looking at me, then his dad.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.940
Dad, why is yours like that? Why are you like that?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.280
Why is that the option you jump to?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680
It could be the other way around!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.060
(Sub: Where is this going...)

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.180
The dad could have been an awesome dad.
