00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.399 
I already saw it after Drive Suzanne
about<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.270> she<00:02:06.570> doesn't<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.930> driving

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
about because she doesn't like driving

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
about because she doesn't like driving
so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.160> imagine<00:02:08.489> people<00:02:08.640> sort<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> going

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so I can imagine people sort of going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.859 
so I can imagine people sort of going
Karl<00:02:09.450> give<00:02:09.599> us<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
Karl give us a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.320 
Karl give us a
left<00:02:09.989> traffic<00:02:10.739> spat<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.879> jump<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.209> your

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
left traffic spat and a jump on your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.339 
left traffic spat and a jump on your
back<00:02:12.420> knee<00:02:12.629> wizards<00:02:12.959> into<00:02:13.200> town<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:16.230> they

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
back knee wizards into town and so they

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.140 
back knee wizards into town and so they
no<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:17.299> don't<00:02:18.299> think<00:02:18.390> about<00:02:18.569> any<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.900> them<00:02:20.150> I've

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
no I don't think about any of them I've

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.649 
no I don't think about any of them I've
sometimes<00:02:21.390> wondered<00:02:21.989> about<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:23.209> how<00:02:24.209> flying

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
sometimes wondered about like how flying

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.330 
sometimes wondered about like how flying
would<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:25.110> handy<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.769> in<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.980> building

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
would be handy if you're in a building

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.740 
would be handy if you're in a building
there's<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.610> fire<00:02:26.819> or<00:02:27.030> something<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.510> jump

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
there's a fire or something you can jump

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
there's a fire or something you can jump
out<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> fly<00:02:28.379> on<00:02:28.409> but<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.159> is<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.340> would<00:02:29.670> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
out and fly on but then is it would it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.390 
out and fly on but then is it would it
just<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.629> enough<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.829> I've<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
just be like enough so I've like that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300 
just be like enough so I've like that
almost<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> chicken<00:02:33.750> has<00:02:33.870> wings<00:02:34.129> do<00:02:35.129> not<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
almost like a chicken has wings do not I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
almost like a chicken has wings do not I
mean<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.489> chicken<00:02:35.909> can't<00:02:36.120> fly<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.420> flapped

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
mean a chicken can't fly it flapped

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.750 
mean a chicken can't fly it flapped
about<00:02:36.959> all<00:02:37.200> over<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.500> shop<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.459> enough

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
about all over the shop but it's enough

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300 
about all over the shop but it's enough
to<00:02:38.790> say<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.659> fell<00:02:39.870> off<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.079> ledge<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
to say that if it fell off a ledge so I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.309 
to say that if it fell off a ledge so I
wonder<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.390> sort<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.690> fly<00:02:42.870> I'd<00:02:43.079> have

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
wonder if that's a sort of fly I'd have

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.229 
wonder if that's a sort of fly I'd have
the<00:02:43.709> sort<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.980> fly<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.459> nobody<00:02:44.849> would<00:02:44.970> be<00:02:45.150> as

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
the sort of fly that nobody would be as

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
the sort of fly that nobody would be as
limited<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.049> lift<00:02:46.200> anywhere<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:47.250> if<00:02:47.280> I

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
limited in the lift anywhere or if I

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.520 
limited in the lift anywhere or if I
fell<00:02:47.670> off<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.879> bridge<00:02:48.030> I'd<00:02:49.019> have<00:02:49.319> enough

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
fell off a bridge I'd have enough

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.380 
fell off a bridge I'd have enough
flapping<00:02:50.069> power<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.670> sort<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:50.940> flap<00:02:51.209> my

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
flapping power just to sort of flap my

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.530 
flapping power just to sort of flap my
way<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> love<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.849> if<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.390> out

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
way down so I love that as if I out

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.339 
way down so I love that as if I out
about<00:02:54.750> three

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
about three

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.349 
about three
I'd<00:02:55.409> go<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:55.769> ability<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> fly<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.329> a

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
I'd go with ability to fly but like a

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.670 
I'd go with ability to fly but like a
chicken

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:14.419
