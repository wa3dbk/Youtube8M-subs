good for big hands and it's definitely

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.020 
good for big hands and it's definitely
very<00:02:19.120> good<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> smaller<00:02:19.960> hands<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:21.030> the

axle<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.540> bottom<00:03:04.870> bracket<00:03:05.200> has<00:03:05.290> not

changed<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.100> any<00:03:06.370> way<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.730> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.090> are

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
changed in any way so if you are

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.550 
changed in any way so if you are
switching<00:03:07.570> over<00:03:07.810> groups<00:03:08.110> it's<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.410> could

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
switching over groups it's you could

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
switching over groups it's you could
just<00:03:08.710> leave<00:03:08.860> your<00:03:09.010> existing<00:03:09.460> bottom<00:03:09.700> bracket

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
just leave your existing bottom bracket

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.790 
just leave your existing bottom bracket
in<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.810> cross<00:03:11.020> compatible<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.710> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.310 
in it is cross compatible with the
ceramic<00:03:12.190> bearing<00:03:12.790> red<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.630> could<00:03:14.080> you

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
ceramic bearing red so you could you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.350 
ceramic bearing red so you could you
know<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.560> an<00:03:14.650> upgraded<00:03:15.100> version<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> group

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
know do an upgraded version of the group

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.390 
know do an upgraded version of the group
said<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.690> could<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.020> ceramic<00:03:17.530> bottom

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
said you could have the ceramic bottom

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.330 
said you could have the ceramic bottom
bracket<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:18.910> your<00:03:18.940> force<00:03:19.510> crank<00:03:19.900> set<00:03:20.140> they<00:03:20.980> put

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
bracket on your force crank set they put

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.280 
bracket on your force crank set they put
a<00:03:21.370> lot<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.910> attention<00:03:22.240> and<00:03:22.600> SRAM<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.960> really

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
a lot of attention and SRAM have really

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.380 
a lot of attention and SRAM have really
come<00:03:23.470> out<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.800> got<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.040> right<00:03:24.340> knee<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.940> the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
come out and got this right knee on the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.760 
come out and got this right knee on the
early<00:03:25.750> group<00:03:25.930> sets<00:03:26.200> had<00:03:26.320> some<00:03:26.470> issues<00:03:26.740> with

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
early group sets had some issues with

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.490 
early group sets had some issues with
maybe<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.820> little<00:03:28.210> flexible<00:03:28.720> chain<00:03:28.990> rings<00:03:29.290> but

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
maybe a little flexible chain rings but

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.590 
maybe a little flexible chain rings but
they've<00:03:29.650> now<00:03:29.980> got<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> sorted<00:03:30.760> out<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.180> it's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
they've now got that sorted out so it's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.800 
they've now got that sorted out so it's
a<00:03:31.810> super<00:03:32.230> beefy<00:03:32.440> alloy<00:03:33.340> chain<00:03:33.760> ring<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.510> has

the hidden bolt which obviously gives a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
lot more stiffness to the crank and it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.430 
lot more stiffness to the crank and it
has<00:03:39.340> very<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.330> lot<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.750> attention<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.230> paid<00:03:41.380> to

the ramps and the pins to ensure the

fastest shifting although we haven't

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
doubt that the shifting will be like it

that's<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.230> group<00:04:02.380> said<00:04:02.620> reasonable<00:04:03.130> price

that's a group said reasonable price
like<00:04:03.820> we<00:04:03.940> said<00:04:04.120> it's<00:04:04.560> 1344<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.650> GXP<00:04:06.190> version

like we said it's 1344 the GXP version
obviously<00:04:06.850> will<00:04:07.510> have<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.930> sale<00:04:08.110> as<00:04:08.290> a
