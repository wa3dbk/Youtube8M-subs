00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello read it comes to him annoying thank you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.190
 many of us receive at your home for 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.720
 to see a portrait doubting but nothing 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.040
 so what can you introduce yourself 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 in a few words 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.700
 my name in nice I'm 20 and I 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.519
 am a makeup artist and I'm in formation 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 hairstyle so that's when 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.029
 I was very small but we will say 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 all the future moms who get 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 make up already but especially the cousin 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 my mom who did not wear makeup 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 a lot but I would always do 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.420
 makeup creams small I 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.180
 did makeup so we had 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 rainbow right on the eyes full 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 things like that but nothing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 it was she who motivated me in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090
 did not mine was this one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 of mom that I took and it was this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 who was me is the cream of eight 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 hours of elizabeth arden classic 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.780
 I started a cream and then I 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 make my complexion corrections a little 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 con touring the eyes an art in general 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.910
 it's often the same simple thing 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.510
 use of eyeliner 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.089
 so to structure and then the lips 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.440
 today it's soft but every day 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.050
 it's a different color normally 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.060
 so that's all right purple and red 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.110
 will then have is what you can have 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.380
 reminded a bit what it is that the 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 contour there dig actually the hollows of the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.720
 little ranking face and accentuate 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.390
 clear up the bombs and so in general 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's going to be the top of the cheekbones 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.210
 temples 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.490
 the bridge of the nose in the eyebrow maton 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 and the cold me I live passing your 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.929
 maneuvers 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 so I have it I think 358 to round 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.490
 after him with the 8 hour boom this is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 one of my favorites 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.539
 so it's the dermophil so it's the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.750
 experts as debtors it was good 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.329
 but to dream in the street it makes a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.009
 little too much gloss for me so I put 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.079
 this one which is one of the best that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.319
 I actually found despite all that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.280
 L was 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.429
 then little illuminator so selection 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.229
 of English but they win at inc rhyme 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.989
 with the accent so it's an illuminator 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.170
 from home and marked too well it is 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.569
 always itu everything bright we see that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.160
 I will show the kitty with rhinestones 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.360
 then seeing that I'm a bit of a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.840
 shampoo dry shampoo 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.040
 this one so garnish fructis because we 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.829
 cleans the hair are the noodles and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.040
 So here bah French song on 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.489
 the roots and then this courage courage 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.760
 this courage and my friends tend to 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.739
 to tell me was super well done when 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 like a big feignasse I got 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.299
 not dream the hair and the genius of the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.430
 dry shampoo 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.010
 then it's not really a product of 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.799
 beauty but we can say when 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
 even so of the other blue and water 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.700
 floral blues is that too it's my 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.170
 Mom since I was little who me 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.150
 said which m now what am I doing 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 it's before sleeping on small 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 cotton like that and it's a bit of a foot 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.450
 everything that I have lenses I have 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.130
 sensitive eyes so that's really 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.470
 resting at the end of the day or when 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.019
 it's too hot you have swollen eyes 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.819
 these tops and little novelty a little 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.010
 arras removal oil and films 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.900
 x they wrote sensitive skins and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.819
 very dry when I do not have skin 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.060
 very dry but I have sensitive skin 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.489
 already invest in 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.709
 the little mcr which costs a lot more 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.560
 expensive than conventional cotton and that are 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.510
 supposed to be great that's it there is nothing 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.849
 better than the hands and then suddenly a 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 oil game but quite generously in 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.310
 hands like two Shiites 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.260
 we're going to say little ones like that and on 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.420
 dry face that I liked 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.010
 hair back on dry face I 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.420
 rub the wave for about three 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.700
 minutes what because we close our eyes 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.860
 Does it confronts cold everywhere we will 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.599
 gently rubs all the same everywhere i 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.590
 go down here and after we emulsify 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.530
 with water and it turns into 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.410
 cleansing milk kind the slogan for 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.540
 be sure that who is really over 10 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.160
 of excess flow is not oil 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.510
 which remains I spend a micellar water 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 after to remove the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.290
 the residual potential shoots he 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.049
 could be good thank you very much to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.760
 iss but nothing out all soon 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:12.239
 some assumptions we do not know 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.239
