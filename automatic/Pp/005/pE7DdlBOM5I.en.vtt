in some kind of Oscorp containment field
now<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.660> cool<00:00:57.960> how<00:00:58.170> it's

like<00:00:58.440> spinning<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> spherical

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
like spinning in some kind of spherical

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549 
like spinning in some kind of spherical
form<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.260> Oscorp

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
form and that it's in an Oscorp

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.950 
form and that it's in an Oscorp
containment<00:01:02.219> field<00:01:02.460> now<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.750> anything

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
containment field now if it's anything

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.130 
containment field now if it's anything
like<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.530> ultimate<00:01:05.070> spider-man<00:01:05.250> comics<00:01:05.790> then

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
like the ultimate spider-man comics then

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.620

Richard<00:01:07.140> Parker<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> Eddie<00:01:07.979> Brock's<00:01:08.250> doubt

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
Richard Parker and Eddie Brock's doubt

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.530 
Richard Parker and Eddie Brock's doubt
created<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.470> symbiote<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.490> cure<00:01:11.729> cancer<00:01:12.240> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
created the symbiote to cure cancer but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450 
created the symbiote to cure cancer but
other<00:01:12.869> people<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
other people want to use it as like a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
other people want to use it as like a
weapon<00:01:15.030> against<00:01:15.540> certain<00:01:16.320> people<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
weapon against certain people and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
weapon against certain people and
Richard<00:01:17.700> Parker<00:01:17.970> didn't<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Richard Parker didn't like that and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
Richard Parker didn't like that and
that's<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.200> killed<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.670> it's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that's when he was killed now if it's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's when he was killed now if it's
anything<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.990> really

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
anything like that then that's a really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
anything like that then that's a really
awesome<00:01:22.650> story<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.640> then<00:01:23.790> again<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.119> could

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
awesome story but then again they could

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
awesome story but then again they could
be<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> symbiote<00:01:25.770> coming<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
be going with the symbiote coming out of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
be going with the symbiote coming out of
the<00:01:26.430> sky<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> meteorite<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.409> I'll

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the sky from a meteorite and then I'll

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
the sky from a meteorite and then I'll
Scott<00:01:29.490> finding<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.570> think

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
Scott finding it but I really think

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
Scott finding it but I really think
taking<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> route<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.909> Richard<00:01:32.909> Parker

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
taking the route of Richard Parker

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.819 
taking the route of Richard Parker
creating<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.780> Eddie<00:01:33.990> Brock's<00:01:34.229> dad<00:01:34.439> creating

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
creating it Eddie Brock's dad creating

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
creating it Eddie Brock's dad creating
it<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.250> both<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.549> killed<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it and then they both get killed on the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.469 
it and then they both get killed on the
plane<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.710> Oscorp<00:01:38.460> keep<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.270> use

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
plane and then Oscorp keep it to use

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
plane and then Oscorp keep it to use
against<00:01:39.900> spider-man<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.560> something<00:01:40.829> like
