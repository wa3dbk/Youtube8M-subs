00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.690
 peter parisi I had the great pleasure 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.090
 and honor of recognizing him in non-epochs 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 suspects very young of course 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.009
 now always a great young chef there 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 truth in the dish a spaghetti alle 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 perfect country tradition then a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.539
 great recovery pietro ingredients 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 we have nuts as the main ingredient 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 hazelnuts eggplant peels is one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 seasoned ricotta all to choose from 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 magnificent hazelnuts then while you say 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.079
 to do 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 and now there is the flat the skins that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.579
 they already kept the Latin peasants a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 its time we say this is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.100
 a very poor dish that is why 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.730
 we find in it all that they were 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 a little that pulled a peasant house 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 then let's take some pleasure oils 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.699
 extra virgin olive oil as always 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 Garlic naturally just barely 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.379
 angelina in a little unusual blonde 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 but they are the parsley ribs 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.350
 but no, but what was the branch of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.610
 precise where they didn't bring us very good 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 and let's put walnuts that our dates 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.430
 here we are in palma campania a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.760
 very rich walnut and walnut ground 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.280
 fruit hazelnuts 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.510
 and therefore with the line they were very rich 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.150
 in the pantry 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.100
 during their Christmas season this 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.990
 not the skins we have just said 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.300
 that's how they are because we have the skins 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.730
 because in summer great abundance of 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.360
 these of these vegetables surrounds 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.060
 dignitaries who put the pulp underneath 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.270
 the skins in oil instead of throwing them 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 sele kept pasta for continuous 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 always keeping it in oil 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.240
 chilli and garlic and we put in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.520
 dispensation given that in winter a little 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.330
 climate a bit for poverty that 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 there was not much in the area 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.400
 to eat in the malga we mix everything together 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 let's go a little let's say it's a 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.619
 review of garlic oil spaghetti 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.720
 among the peasants who usually do it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.420
 they did during the Christmas season 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.660
 Christmas because having neither fruits of 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.730
 sea nor anything else they did 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 spaghetti loach and lucilla in addition one 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
 enriched with these chickens 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.090
 ingredients that comes to mind the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.260
 Our net while it is being cooked 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.630
 we say that today we also have some 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.640
 visited putting the spaghetti because in 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.430
 those moments the wheat was a dish 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.410
 very rich and was not present in the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.959
 houses of the poor some put or the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.959
 ram silvia di basta that is all rising 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 less noble part of the grain even 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.640
 the sofa with potato skins 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.739
 this is the reality really during the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.750
 missions puts us some water of 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.510
 cooking pasta to give the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.310
 seasoning that create an amalgam 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.790
 yes because it was a bit of a sauce it is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.519
 salsetta the spaghetti we put to a little 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.100
 of eight-day bread a hardened bread 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.489
 5 give this crunchiness too 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.250
 next there was a thing colors with 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.440
 the contrast is a trend today 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.230
 but perhaps it was already a trend over the years 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.190
 20 in the thirties in that case it was 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 for dc problems for the neighboring 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.230
 once the spaghetti is well understood 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 always al dente we dip that knows 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.140
 in this peel sauce and us 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.930
 let's cook a few more minutes 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.280
 inside we cook it we do 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.390
 to move on 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.750
 put another bit of parsley 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.269
 always the changes of those changes because 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.790
 because the leaves even if they came 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.220
 used for the pantry to put 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.410
 under the other era organized for a 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.140
 face aspect of greater importance to 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.069
 recent of this transmits some of a 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.440
 bit of another bit of cooking water 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.049
 so very easy minutes that leaves 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.310
 the touch that was beautiful second dini 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.980
 given that in times of war that is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.599
 the results going into these three 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.819
 the country was stealing the cheese 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.359
 so what did they make the 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.180
 cheese in coals says they put it 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.250
 below ground making them flee from 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.590
 coals and kept it so that i 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.050
 soldiers could not stolen so 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.479
 look at the face looks like coal and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.690
 nuclear instead inside is a format 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.820
 this cheese was grated 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.039
 We repeat the operation and we see it again 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.200
 well mixed we remember that the ash 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.419
 is an important element was 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.979
 even used to wash 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.720
 everyone's clothes are very much a thing 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.880
 which also comes to sterilize some 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.070
 some fair perfume products as always 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.349
 it is remarkable as always we cannot 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.200
 we might one day succeed in giving it 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.940
 such neighbor less than we love and we are 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.720
 ready and we are with tea in the square 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.849
 then the spaghetti emit it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.400
 we also import a choice 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.669
 that we did on wine not by chance la 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.560
 life is fundamental on the territory we are 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.900
 remained on the territory because we want 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.270
 so that the territory and via emerges certain 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.300
 being rewarded is chosen not by chance ho 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.510
 chosen for the territory 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.220
 we remained with an ancient myth 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.949
 Catalanista yummy exceptional not 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.539
 I know but these vineyards and here I miss that 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.490
 a white man but excuse this law 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.440
 before they were used as grapes 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 table then instead one 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.390
 company knew how to recover them 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.160
 beautifully already become an igt 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.570
 final touch over again with everything 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.170
 what's left we put gods 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:49.290
 croutons is a bit of bread always made 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:52.320
 magnificent and we are in a splendid place 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.070
 dish you see great we believed 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.070
 good in its time
