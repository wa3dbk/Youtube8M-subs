00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.809
 jos starts here with such a puzzle 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.380
 crate that should be a small one 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.630
 guitar amplifiers will be in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.150
 tube technology so not a single one 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.150
 transistor that he met ma15 mk2 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.059
 marvel at the beautiful layout of the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.340
 Of course, components like this leaves a heart 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 beat faster 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.969
 yes great everything predrilled at tc 66 must 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.250
 I always everything to the right the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.640
 I like it from the start I want 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.750
 assemble immediately 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 That's just nice to look at 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.719
 it just makes me laugh 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.520
 really fun with me i can do now 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.690
 I do not make such a single picture 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.690
 Do it all at once 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:14.369
 that should be relatively easy the action 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:17.490
 Sinks water cable comes the collection 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 but please do not laugh silently 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.850
 because a device is not 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
 one says catalysed calibrated or 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.049
 something and he can totally wrong chooses 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.369
 but that was not so much me 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.229
 have inter already the right things 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.649
 took 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:41.940
 I laugh, please, yes that is because for 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.520
 such as stand up, or 98 of the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:51.119
 the second half is all a bit 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 less a coordinated case so what 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.300
 That's why I like the colors 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 and about the real function like 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 something capo happened and we need to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.170
 not much idea maybe you can 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.130
 still yes i do not mean any blueprints 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:19.739
 read and so and a little bit 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.280
 however, there is no collapse 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.280
 high voltage 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:38.010
 we see that yes some solder joints me 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.010
 have just bring think spits 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
 also still from not quite but I 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 I always measured it as it always did 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:53.609
 So everything is okay now from 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:56.220
 meter makes you pretty funny out yes 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:59.250
 have fun doing that and good i already have one 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.540
 a few hours needed for that because I 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.250
 the whole cup is something 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.630
 any had to measure and the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.540
 Partly I have been at all 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 I have to solder around and stuff like that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:16.350
 But again, I think to myself what the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.299
 restaurant how ok it is the small one 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.000
 board still remains a lot of stuff 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.510
 left over and all the actions 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.960
 it will not be a bit 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.970
 pay that's true 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.130
 no matter how I get along with it I already have it 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 that's kind of like everything here 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.900
 last and main problem that this 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.760
 gray mass cable what comes next 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.860
 yes so what comes in mind it because the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.880
 Mass is plugged in again or is it 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.880
 medium cable also there
