00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 a circular mold 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.860
 it can be a mold of stars like this 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.950
 and it may be different coastal form want to give 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 inside the other side 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.760
 to give him the opportunity to be 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.170
 that they are golden 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.090
 they take the form we have data tolerate 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 a tap 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.810
 We would throw the potatoes 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.300
 we are doing both things we are making the protons 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.670
 the star by the molds of the mofongo 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.970
 in which 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 let's start 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 to prepare 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.790

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.540
 we can do it toto also quoted 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 in this way papaya was thrown 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940
 percent and that we get out of the golden oven 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.969
 we put it in the opportunity 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.309
 the press masters to make the same hole 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.819
 there is always when caesar out and that to modify it there is little to help them 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.479
 because the mold to bs 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.169

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:21.889

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:31.319
 now the molds are going to take the worlds out of the oven that are already golden brown 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.029

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.629
 he already has love and he lowered it 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.149
 the brewer's yeast that comes importing theme 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.149
 We always keep it in mind because what it gives 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.879
 the taste and the food 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
 in the complement of the mintur all kitchen 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.449
 so she having 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.449
 prepared to the sauce we will proceed 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.579
 move it and deposit it 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.949
 in the little book that we made to the star 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.359
