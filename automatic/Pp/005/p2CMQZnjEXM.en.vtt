00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.990 

it's<00:02:07.740> got<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> metal<00:02:08.100> diff<00:02:08.340> gears<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.759> there

it's got the metal diff gears in there

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's got the metal diff gears in there
that's<00:02:12.000> about<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> guys<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.660> pretty

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that's about it guys so pretty

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.600 
that's about it guys so pretty
straightforward<00:02:13.140> very<00:02:13.650> similar<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> xB

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
straightforward very similar to the xB

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.370 
straightforward very similar to the xB
and<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> XT<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.750> you've<00:02:15.840> seen<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.200> past

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and the XT that you've seen in the past

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
and the XT that you've seen in the past
with<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.340> obviously<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> short<00:02:18.300> car

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with this obviously is the short car

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.960 
with this obviously is the short car
struck<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.380> biggest<00:02:19.890> difference<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.459> body

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
struck so biggest difference is the body

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.240 
struck so biggest difference is the body
and<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.750> wheels<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.080> tires<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:23.489> bumpers

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.440 

there<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.430> go<00:02:30.790> any<00:02:30.909> questions<00:02:31.209> let<00:02:31.360> me<00:02:31.390> know

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
there you go any questions let me know

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.880 
there you go any questions let me know
