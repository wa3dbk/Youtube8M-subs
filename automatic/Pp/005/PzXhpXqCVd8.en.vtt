00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.170
 second video in this second video 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 point we will trace the new one because exit 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:24.180
 two days ago the 1.4.2 note I owe 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 say he admitted new and beautiful things today 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.480
 I will show you one of these the hole in the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 previous video 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 then I realized that to do for example 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.239
 it could be used by the parish priest 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.190
 but of the 9 but then browsing up 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 internet sky like a when me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.149
 even watching videos I discovered that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.149
 this lighthouse serves another purpose 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.500
 notice these lines of light well these 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.170
 they are our loved ones 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 ok as you can see there are several 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.600
 different pyramids platforms 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:16.189
 material we join the iron the emerald e 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.220
 they are above these is the lighthouse ok 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.549
 this word will help us to obtain gods 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.549
 powers 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.340
 now 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.299
 with this pyramid I put the power 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.299
 of speed 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.090
 now what 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.320
 just do enough to have a quantity of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.040
 these materials indicated the emerald 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.950
 their diamond is iron 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.600
 we take one of our materials ad 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:57.040
 example on iron 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.390
 and we think 1 and then you do it in 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.659
 this way doing is you will get this 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.289
 set of powers directly all three 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.690
 because I made them already before and 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.739
 you find them in the range of these 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.709
 noble traits for example I activated i 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.160
 powers from the speed of jumping and 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.160
 resistance 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.540
 we see the speed as you already see from 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.400
 normal is increased and if we try to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.400
 run fast we will notice the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 difference 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 we see it happen but I succeed because of 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360
 fast 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:10.030
 here is also the increased jump we can 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:15.180
 see it all right 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.180
 you almost skip two blocks 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.390
 these are also travel I am 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.580
 obviously there is also the well of the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.660
 resistance 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.370
 we have to decide more firm resistance 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.080
 france never way to get one of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.660
 these pyramids 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.420
 a block structure must be made 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.769
 at 0 of 5 x 5 and fill also 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.890
 inside of 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.950
 however it must be covered with one 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.390
 3x3 structure and in the middle place this 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.239
 lighthouse 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.180
 obviously if we then go to click 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.540
 on the lighthouse to increase the bonus e 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.810
 take it to the next level 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.590
 we should do various levels 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.680
 the various levels of the pyramid that go 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.790
 from the two layers up to the four layers 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.350
 maximum that would be the maximum level 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.350
 that can reach a power 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.770
 the video ends here I hope to be 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.990
 clarified and apologize again for the error 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.400
 I did yesterday in the video 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:40.289
 these were the headlights of peace 1.4.2 of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.289
 mike will come
