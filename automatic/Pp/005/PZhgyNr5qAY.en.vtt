00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello so today a very video 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.219
 short to tell you about melon 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.710
 why the melon because it's one of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.379
 my favorite fruits and that we are 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.930
 in the melon season and you do not have to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.840
 hesitate to enjoy this fruit without 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 excess is always the same I wanted 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400
 give you my little tips for 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 correctly choose a moment because 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 I think it's important and often 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.170
 gets caught and we come across 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.380
 bad melon and that's right it's 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.170
 not very nice so me for me 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.739
 my tip is first tip first 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 number one is to look in I call 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.559
 that the melon sex of course we did not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 sex but it's just for you 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.840
 give a landmark so I always I 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.670
 choose what I call melons 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 femen ie those who have a big 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 big tits big circle here and you 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.239
 will see there is a lot a lot of melon 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.090
 who are what I call evil melons 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.760
 with a tiny little dot here 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.950
 instead of those of this great of this 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 big circle 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.000
 so that's really my first 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.890
 priority is to choose what I call 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 a violent fire but the girls are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.259
 always much better so 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.400
 so that's so big as that the most 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 possible and when you see that it's 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 very small a tiny point and well 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 there I advise you not to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.390
 then obviously take the weight more 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.270
 a melon is heavy the better it is and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.130
 then third point the fact that the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 tail gets loose a little here so that's 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.079
 also a sign of maturity 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.390
 and fourthly the smell more in good the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.040
 the better it is here it was my four 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.430
 little tips for choosing a good 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.100
 melon 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.170
 you tell me that's what it is 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.270
 relationship with beauty health I you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.990

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.060

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.329
