00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
only yet eventually eventually I'll get

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.920 
only yet eventually eventually I'll get
it<00:05:39.229> down<00:05:39.259> to<00:05:39.649> just<00:05:39.919> one<00:05:40.310> plant<00:05:40.699> for<00:05:41.629> a<00:05:41.689> foot

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
it down to just one plant for a foot

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.409 
it down to just one plant for a foot
such<00:05:42.500> as<00:05:42.680> what<00:05:42.860> it<00:05:42.979> is<00:05:43.099> right<00:05:43.339> here<00:05:43.399> right<00:05:44.389> here

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
such as what it is right here right here

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.540 
such as what it is right here right here
to<00:05:44.689> start<00:05:44.960> with<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:46.159> I<00:05:46.550> guess<00:05:46.610> it's<00:05:46.789> about

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
to start with and I guess it's about

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.010 
to start with and I guess it's about
that's<00:05:49.550> probably<00:05:49.879> about<00:05:50.000> four<00:05:50.360> inches<00:05:50.719> tall

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
that's probably about four inches tall

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.920 
that's probably about four inches tall
so<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:52.430> what's<00:05:52.610> in<00:05:52.729> pretty<00:05:52.939> good<00:05:53.000> shape<00:05:53.330> not

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
so so what's in pretty good shape not

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.589 
so so what's in pretty good shape not
four<00:05:54.169> inches<00:05:54.409> tall<00:05:54.710> nice<00:05:55.009> and<00:05:55.250> healthy<00:05:55.460> I<00:05:55.849> need

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
four inches tall nice and healthy I need

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.189 
four inches tall nice and healthy I need
to<00:05:56.870> need<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.830> water<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.159> right<00:05:58.490> now<00:05:58.990> not<00:05:59.990> doing

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
to need to water it right now not doing

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.219 
to need to water it right now not doing
too<00:06:00.379> bad<00:06:00.620> since<00:06:00.889> its<00:06:01.159> since<00:06:02.060> its<00:06:02.240> most<00:06:02.569> but<00:06:02.990> I

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
too bad since its since its most but I

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.399 
too bad since its since its most but I
do<00:06:03.770> need<00:06:04.039> to<00:06:04.099> water<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.960> like<00:06:05.960> I<00:06:05.990> say<00:06:06.229> I'll

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
do need to water it and like I say I'll

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.559 
do need to water it and like I say I'll
be<00:06:06.589> thinning<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:07.399> down<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.789> just<00:06:08.000> like<00:06:08.210> it<00:06:08.360> is

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
be thinning it down to just like it is

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.290 
be thinning it down to just like it is
right<00:06:08.779> here<00:06:08.960> to<00:06:09.050> start<00:06:09.289> with<00:06:09.529> one<00:06:10.460> plant<00:06:10.879> per

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
right here to start with one plant per

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.600 
right here to start with one plant per
foot<00:06:11.810> this<00:06:12.439> is<00:06:12.589> probably<00:06:12.830> my<00:06:13.069> biggest<00:06:13.250> one

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
foot this is probably my biggest one

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.570 
foot this is probably my biggest one
right<00:06:13.669> here<00:06:14.210> it's<00:06:15.080> nice<00:06:15.409> and<00:06:15.649> bushing<00:06:16.159> healthy

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
right here it's nice and bushing healthy

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.999 
right here it's nice and bushing healthy
that's<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.360> main<00:06:17.509> thing<00:06:17.539> is<00:06:17.750> all<00:06:18.289> of<00:06:18.710> it<00:06:18.860> looks

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 
that's the main thing is all of it looks

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.899 
that's the main thing is all of it looks
healthy<00:06:19.399> so<00:06:19.639> eventually<00:06:20.479> it<00:06:20.930> will<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:22.550> will<00:06:22.580> do

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
healthy so eventually it will it will do

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.570 
healthy so eventually it will it will do
good<00:06:23.120> and<00:06:23.360> I'll<00:06:23.509> have<00:06:24.069> hopefully<00:06:25.069> some<00:06:25.399> medley

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
good and I'll have hopefully some medley

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.850 
good and I'll have hopefully some medley
some<00:06:25.879> seven<00:06:26.240> foot<00:06:26.360> tall<00:06:26.389> okra<00:06:27.319> plants<00:06:27.680> here

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
some seven foot tall okra plants here

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.540 
some seven foot tall okra plants here
but<00:06:28.189> anyway<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.789> okra<00:06:29.300> is<00:06:29.740> coming<00:06:30.740> along<00:06:30.979> like

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
but anyway the okra is coming along like

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.009 
but anyway the okra is coming along like
really<00:06:32.029> nicely<00:06:32.560> everything's<00:06:33.560> doing<00:06:33.709> the

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:35.019 
really nicely everything's doing the

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.750 
really nicely everything's doing the
curling<00:06:36.019> is<00:06:36.080> doing<00:06:36.319> really<00:06:36.440> nicely<00:06:36.740> so

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
curling is doing really nicely so

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.180 
curling is doing really nicely so
that<00:06:37.970> is<00:06:38.150> my<00:06:38.360> math<00:06:39.170> fairly<00:06:39.650> quick<00:06:39.860> garden

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
that is my math fairly quick garden

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.520 
that is my math fairly quick garden
