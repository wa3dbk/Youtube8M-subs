the<00:00:00.599> next<00:00:00.900> type<00:00:01.050> of<00:00:01.079> yo-yos<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.949> it's<00:00:02.399> the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
the next type of yo-yos and it's the

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.490 
the next type of yo-yos and it's the
type<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.790> yo-yos<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.720> you're<00:00:04.110> gonna<00:00:04.259> see

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
type of yo-yos that you're gonna see

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.760 
type of yo-yos that you're gonna see
everyone<00:00:05.040> using<00:00:05.490> if<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.970> go<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.270> contest<00:00:06.839> if

everyone using if you go to a contest if
you<00:00:07.890> look<00:00:08.040> online<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.580> anywhere<00:00:09.000> else<00:00:09.150> with

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
you look online at anywhere else with

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.720 
you look online at anywhere else with
his<00:00:09.510> videos<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:09.870> whatnot<00:00:10.370> all<00:00:11.370> bearing

his videos and whatnot all bearing

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.640 
his videos and whatnot all bearing
yo-yos<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.179> worth<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.259> new<00:00:13.380> tricks

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
yo-yos is worth that all the new tricks

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.770 
yo-yos is worth that all the new tricks
we're<00:00:13.830> doing<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> fancy<00:00:14.820> new<00:00:15.089> stuff<00:00:15.389> it's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we're doing all the fancy new stuff it's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.830 
we're doing all the fancy new stuff it's
because<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> ball<00:00:16.500> bearings<00:00:16.910> if<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.090> look<00:00:18.300> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
because of ball bearings if you look in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 
because of ball bearings if you look in
a<00:00:19.080> yo-yo<00:00:19.289> you've<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.460> ball<00:00:21.060> bearing<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
a yo-yo you've got a ball bearing this

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.710 
a yo-yo you've got a ball bearing this
is<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> bulb<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> ruler<00:00:22.850> goes<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> center<00:00:24.630> of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
is a bulb a ruler goes in the center of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
is a bulb a ruler goes in the center of
the<00:00:24.840> yo-yo<00:00:25.140> itself<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> actually

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the yo-yo itself and this is actually

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
the yo-yo itself and this is actually
what<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> string<00:00:26.820> goes<00:00:27.240> around<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
what the string goes around on to it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320 
what the string goes around on to it
I'll<00:00:29.220> show<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> real<00:00:29.580> quick<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.090> ball

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
I'll show you real quick what a ball

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
I'll show you real quick what a ball
bearing<00:00:30.480> looks<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:30.990> inside<00:00:31.610> you'll<00:00:32.610> notice

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bearing looks like inside you'll notice

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.620 
bearing looks like inside you'll notice
this<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.120> has<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.500> circle<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.370> inside<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
this one has the circle and inside here

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.410 
this one has the circle and inside here
you've<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.320> little<00:00:37.380> balls<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
you've got all these little balls and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.180 
you've got all these little balls and
actually<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> all<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> factory

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
actually this is all some of the factory

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.619 
actually this is all some of the factory
of<00:00:41.280> lubricant<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.850> comes<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> help

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of lubricant that comes in there to help

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.880 
of lubricant that comes in there to help
keep<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> rust<00:00:43.379> out

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
keep the rust out

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.350 
keep the rust out
but<00:00:44.219> you'll<00:00:44.340> notice<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.210> balls

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
but you'll notice all these little balls

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
but you'll notice all these little balls
go<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.140> happens<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> these

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
go in there and what happens is these

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420 
go in there and what happens is these
spin<00:00:47.670> around<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> yo-yo<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.980> onto

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
spin around is what the yo-yo is onto

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
spin around is what the yo-yo is onto
and<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> yo-yo<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.570> spinning<00:00:51.780> around<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and as the yo-yo is spinning around this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
and as the yo-yo is spinning around this
because<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.579> those<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.969> balls<00:00:54.320> you've

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
because of all those little balls you've

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
because of all those little balls you've
reduced<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.100> friction<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.789> much<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
reduced the friction so much that you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540 
reduced the friction so much that you
can<00:00:57.960> land<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> yo-yo<00:00:58.350> multiple<00:00:59.100> times<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
can land the yo-yo multiple times in the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.479 
can land the yo-yo multiple times in the
string<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.930> keep<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> spinning<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
string you can keep it spinning for you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.520 
string you can keep it spinning for you
know<00:01:02.579> minutes<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.180> end<00:01:03.449> without<00:01:03.629> any<00:01:03.960> problems

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
know minutes on end without any problems

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
know minutes on end without any problems
and<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.309> helps<00:01:05.580> improve<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and it really helps improve the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
and it really helps improve the
performance<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> let<00:01:08.280> me<00:01:08.340> show<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.610> real

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
performance so let me show you real

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.840 
performance so let me show you real
quick<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> string<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.460> string

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
quick we got a string here the string

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
quick we got a string here the string
itself<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.900> mentioned<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:13.860> strands

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
itself as we mentioned the two strands

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.330 
itself as we mentioned the two strands
of<00:01:14.400> string<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.840> comes<00:01:16.110> around<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.920> bearing

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
of string it comes around the bearing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
of string it comes around the bearing
like<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> yo-yo<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.400> spinning

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
like so so as the yo-yo is spinning

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
like so so as the yo-yo is spinning
you'll<00:01:21.180> notice<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> bearing<00:01:22.020> isn't<00:01:22.320> moving

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you'll notice that bearing isn't moving

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
you'll notice that bearing isn't moving
at<00:01:22.740> all<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.759> yoyo<00:01:24.030> spinning

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
at all it's just the yoyo spinning

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
at all it's just the yoyo spinning
around<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.979> we<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> together<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> string

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
around it we put it together the string

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
around it we put it together the string
is<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.420> around<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.110> bearing<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
is just around that one bearing as you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
is just around that one bearing as you
tighten<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> gap<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
tighten the gap up and so because of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
tighten the gap up and so because of
that<00:01:34.829> bearing<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:35.970> land<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that bearing you can land it on the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.969 
that bearing you can land it on the
string<00:01:36.720> let<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> sit<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.079> do<00:01:40.079> tricks

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
string let it sit there and do tricks

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.139 
string let it sit there and do tricks
that<00:01:41.220> were<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.549> never<00:01:41.909> before<00:01:42.270> impossible

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
that were just never before impossible

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.480 
that were just never before impossible
you'll<00:01:45.149> notice<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> band<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.619> you

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you'll notice with the band in there you

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
you'll notice with the band in there you
can<00:01:47.670> land<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.210> two<00:01:48.509> three<00:01:48.930> times<00:01:49.170> even<00:01:49.530> in

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
can land it one two three times even in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
can land it one two three times even in
the<00:01:49.890> gap<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> bearing<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the gap and because that bearing is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
the gap and because that bearing is
spinning<00:01:52.170> freely<00:01:52.439> there's<00:01:52.860> nothing<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
spinning freely there's nothing there to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
spinning freely there's nothing there to
stop<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.479> coming<00:01:54.659> back<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> your<00:01:55.140> hand<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
stopping it from spinning because of
