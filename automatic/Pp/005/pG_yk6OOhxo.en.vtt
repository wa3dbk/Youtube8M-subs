next time you're thinking about shooting

next time you're thinking about shooting
portraits<00:01:39.709> of<00:01:39.979> midday<00:01:40.160> what's<00:01:40.490> really<00:01:40.789> the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
portraits of midday what's really the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.880 
portraits of midday what's really the
lesson<00:01:41.060> here<00:01:41.360> folks<00:01:41.599> is<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.229> make<00:01:42.440> sure<00:01:42.649> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
lesson here folks is to make sure and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.859 
lesson here folks is to make sure and
use<00:01:43.099> a<00:01:43.130> little<00:01:43.520> bit<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.729> fill<00:01:43.880> flesh<00:01:44.149> if<00:01:44.630> you

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
use a little bit of fill flesh if you

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.150 
use a little bit of fill flesh if you
don't<00:01:45.110> have<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.349> benefit<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.740> things<00:01:46.009> like

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
don't have the benefit of things like

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.699 
don't have the benefit of things like
reflectors<00:01:46.700> or<00:01:46.759> diffusers<00:01:47.539> the<00:01:48.289> simplest

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
reflectors or diffusers the simplest

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.020 
reflectors or diffusers the simplest
approach<00:01:48.830> here<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.310> course<00:01:49.459> is<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.759> use<00:01:50.000> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
approach here of course is the use of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.690 
approach here of course is the use of
the<00:01:50.270> flesh<00:01:50.509> but<00:01:51.110> again<00:01:51.440> manual<00:01:52.190> exposure<00:01:52.490> on

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the flesh but again manual exposure on

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.180 
the flesh but again manual exposure on
the<00:01:52.819> camera<00:01:53.179> set<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.810> ambient<00:01:54.289> for<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
the camera set the ambient for the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.880 
the camera set the ambient for the
ambient<00:01:56.149> light<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.750> when<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.590> use<00:01:57.740> your

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
ambient light and when you use your

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.339 
ambient light and when you use your
flash<00:01:58.099> in<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.700> case<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.090> set<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.539> minus<00:01:59.959> one

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
flash in this case I set it to minus one

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.070 
flash in this case I set it to minus one
so<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.280> doesn't<00:02:01.310> overpower<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:02.660> subject

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
so it doesn't overpower the subject

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080 
so it doesn't overpower the subject
itself<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.950> minus<00:02:04.250> one<00:02:04.459> just<00:02:04.700> fills<00:02:04.910> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
itself that minus one just fills it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.600 
itself that minus one just fills it
