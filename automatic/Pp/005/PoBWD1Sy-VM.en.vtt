videos<00:02:40.459> based<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.750> its<00:02:41.989> actual<00:02:42.350> functionality

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
videos based on its actual functionality

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.970 
videos based on its actual functionality
i'll<00:02:44.510> start<00:02:44.900> taking<00:02:45.200> apart<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.650> rest<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
i'll start taking apart the rest of the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.170 
i'll start taking apart the rest of the
box<00:02:46.190> here<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.550> see<00:02:46.730> if<00:02:46.790> there's<00:02:46.970> anything

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
box here to see if there's anything

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.850 
box here to see if there's anything
inside<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.050> underneath<00:02:54.350> we<00:02:54.650> got

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
inside all right so underneath we got

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.479 
inside all right so underneath we got
the<00:02:55.700> USB<00:02:56.090> charger<00:02:56.480> cable<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.620> sim<00:02:57.950> tool<00:02:58.220> which

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
the USB charger cable the sim tool which

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.610 
the USB charger cable the sim tool which
I<00:02:58.670> guess<00:02:58.880> fell<00:02:59.330> out<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.600> its<00:02:59.810> placement<00:03:00.200> but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
I guess fell out of its placement but

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.130 
I guess fell out of its placement but
that's<00:03:00.800> fine<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:02.180> think<00:03:02.600> something<00:03:02.900> else<00:03:02.930> is

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
that's fine I think something else is

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.570 
that's fine I think something else is
mentioning<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.830> they're<00:03:04.070> supposed<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.430> be

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
mentioning that they're supposed to be

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.199 
mentioning that they're supposed to be
some<00:03:04.790> sort<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:05.500> manual<00:03:06.500> inside<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.489> box<00:03:07.820> but

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
some sort of manual inside this box but

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.920 
some sort of manual inside this box but
I<00:03:08.239> don't<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.550> secondary<00:03:11.060> box<00:03:11.300> that
