but<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.659> think<00:00:00.989> those<00:00:01.170> younger<00:00:01.500> people<00:00:02.010> those

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
but I think those younger people those

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.630 
but I think those younger people those
in<00:00:02.429> their<00:00:02.639> 30s<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.449> 40s<00:00:03.600> who<00:00:04.410> now<00:00:04.650> know<00:00:05.400> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
in their 30s and 40s who now know that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.720 
in their 30s and 40s who now know that
the<00:00:05.730> state<00:00:05.970> pension<00:00:06.240> age<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.690> likely<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.410> rise

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
the state pension age is likely to rise

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.009 
the state pension age is likely to rise
faster<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> future<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.540> think<00:00:09.750> they'll<00:00:09.900> be

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
faster in the future I think they'll be

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
faster in the future I think they'll be
quite<00:00:10.260> worried<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.160> although<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.400> think<00:00:11.639> we

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
quite worried and although I think we

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.009 
quite worried and although I think we
are<00:00:11.820> acknowledging<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.840> average

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
are acknowledging that we are on average

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.320 
are acknowledging that we are on average
living<00:00:13.469> much<00:00:13.710> longer<00:00:13.940> what<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.150> also

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
living much longer what is also

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.910 
living much longer what is also
happening<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.139> those<00:00:16.320> who<00:00:16.500> living<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
happening is that those who living the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.230 
happening is that those who living the
longest<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> gap<00:00:17.760> between<00:00:17.940> those

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
longest think the gap between those

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
longest think the gap between those
living<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.750> longest<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.289> those<00:00:19.470> who<00:00:19.680> don't

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
living the longest and those who don't

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
living the longest and those who don't
if<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.430> long<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> widening<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.539> think

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
if so long is widening and I think

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000 
if so long is widening and I think
that's<00:00:21.869> worrying<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.710> other<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:22.980> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that's worrying the other thing that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
that's worrying the other thing that
caught<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.369> eye<00:00:23.400> was<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> getting

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
caught my eye was a way of getting

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
caught my eye was a way of getting
today's<00:00:25.289> pensioners<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> those<00:00:26.250> who<00:00:26.519> reach

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
today's pensioners and those who reach

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.480 
today's pensioners and those who reach
pension<00:00:27.119> age<00:00:27.240> before<00:00:27.529> 2016<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.189> able<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
pension age before 2016 to be able to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.160 
pension age before 2016 to be able to
buy<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:30.029> extra<00:00:30.330> pinch<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.840> that's<00:00:30.960> quite

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
buy some extra pinch and that's quite

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.410 
buy some extra pinch and that's quite
interesting<00:00:31.610> missed<00:00:32.610> opportunities<00:00:33.239> though

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
interesting missed opportunities though

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
interesting missed opportunities though
on<00:00:33.630> children's<00:00:34.469> savings<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.190> think<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
on children's savings I think it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
on children's savings I think it
would've<00:00:35.579> been<00:00:35.640> great<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.420> he'd<00:00:36.690> let<00:00:36.960> parents

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
would've been great if he'd let parents

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
would've been great if he'd let parents
transfer<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.700> old<00:00:38.850> child<00:00:39.390> trust<00:00:39.719> funds<00:00:40.079> into

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
transfer the old child trust funds into

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
transfer the old child trust funds into
