 rear axle differential 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.790
 what is most interesting I want to say on 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.880
 this topic is that this car is amazing 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.920
 passenger in their tents 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.470
 compared to other pickups you sit in 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.340
 chair almost no way in the Passat but 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.600
 like golf 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.230
 big big distance in sensations 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.330
 from driving to passenger seats from 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.850
 ordinary passenger cars are not felt 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.580
 while the steering is amazing 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.400
 a short two and a half turn from 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.800
 lock to lock and in dynamics all in 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 okay, but now we are half a ton of sand 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.930
 thrown into the trunk in the luggage compartment in 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.450
 loading platform 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.459
 Here is a cat has become much softer going 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.280
 literally as if in some kind and 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.489
 date of the executive class here 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.470
 when he unloaded of course feeling 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.470
 large vibrations that is what it is 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.750
 Well, here the task is done sand delivered 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:12.019
 and unloaded came had to overcome 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.060
 slightly by health but by connecting full 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.820
 drive even block the back 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.310
 cross-axle differential I didn't have to 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.320
 did not notice any particular difference in 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.870
 amarok off-road capability 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.940
 whether empty as if with half a ton and 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.550
 the trunk and three people in the cabin 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.410
 car rushing just ahead through only 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.300
 head needs to be friends to the area 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.000
 plant if you are not friends with your head 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.590
 no four-wheel drive will not help the attack 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 rock ash siduhu yes you only 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.330
 you turn and that's it 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:00.169
 Well, here we are on our way to the city 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.179
 machine behavior after mine 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.179
 unloaded somewhat changed she 

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:06.249
 become tougher shake on 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.319
 irregularities 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:13.389
 but, all the same, the level of comfort 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:16.240
 equally acceptable worthy much saline 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:20.149
 multifunctional machine which 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.819
 perfect for people who are addicted 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:28.099
 active recreation fishing hunting 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.379
 just some fun forest mushrooms there 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.709
 berries and other wherever you want 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.110
 wherever you want to go in comfort and 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:39.050
 By the way, by the way , Iâ€™ll give you a few words 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.599
 I will say on the subject of additional 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.849
 equipment it kung who are over 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.399
 our cargo platform is us 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.379
 today the weather is lucky if the weather 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.240
 was not very good she would 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.990
 problematic enough anything 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.319
 translate 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.749
 and the cube always helps so if you 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.789
 amarok liked and you do not carry 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.349
 anything in the form of the eiffel tower on 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.539
 bodywork 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:05.449
 then you put such a thing not to regret 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:10.309
 honest word and curtain consumption 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.599
 fuel we drove 148 kilometers and with 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.990
 considering loading 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.209
 crawling over the primer discharge and almost 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.139
 watch rattle at idle 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:24.439
 fuel consumption is 8.8 liters per 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.419
 100 kilometers is a record minimum 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:31.089
 in these conditions, friends 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.089
