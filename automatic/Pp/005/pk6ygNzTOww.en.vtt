00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.889
 Hi there, this is a project by force and 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.630
 today we continue to prepare for 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.700
 learning tricks on the bar 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.800
 in past classes we have already analyzed how 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.050
 learn how to wring out polo correctly though 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.840
 would be 30 times and competently pull up on 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.599
 market at least 10 times our next target 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.550
 20 competent push-ups in which 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.190
 prepare for your active work 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.710
 the pectoral muscles deltoid and triceps and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.130
 so get divorced on uneven bars putting on 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.960
 them palms and arms straight elbows 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.760
 cross your ankles bend your knees and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.340
 tilt the body forward slightly 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.800
 keeping the body tilt bend your arms 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.600
 elbows and get down to shoulder parallel with 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.910
 bars not lower 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.859
 return to the starting position completely 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.629
 arms straightened 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.339
 if you can cleanly execute 20 such 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.809
 pushups boldly go to the next 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.089
 video lesson 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.489
 if you do a few pushups but not 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.220
 23 Russia again distributed by the following 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 the program is doing 6 cents and 58 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.140
 repeat push ups on the bars 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.790
 rest and do one pushups 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 from the floor to the maximum amount 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.670
 reps every week adding on 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.410
 one set of bar push ups and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 keep pushing yourself 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.300
 so 6 weeks rest 5 days and try 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 perform the maximum amount 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.200
 push-ups on the bars 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 the results will please people from but what 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.400
 do if you can't wring out 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.320
 uneven bars you have at least once 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.180
 four exercises that will help you 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.910
 develop the muscle groups you need 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.800
 first jumping on a bar for a start 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.580
 try to just jump on 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.620
 parallel bars does 3-4 sets of 10-12 such 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.440
 jumping started their workouts 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.300
 second negative push ups jump out 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.580
 top point and get down 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.640
 bending elbows as slowly as possible 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.040
 repeat do 35 cents 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.800
 o 6 8 reps on each 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.640
 workout third push ups from the bench in 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.860
 emphasis behind 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.140
 This exercise includes the same work. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.270
 most muscle groups but gives less 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.980
 load do 2-3 sets on 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.220
 maximum number of repetitions per 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.910
 each workout and the fourth partial 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.980
 repetitions 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.080
 from the top point try first 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.180
 sink only a third of the amplitude 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.550
 then come back as 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.650
 only master 15 repetitions start 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.990
 go down to half reach again 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.970
 15 reps now try jazz on 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.690
 full amplitude should not turn out 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.910
 less than 8 repetitions and on this for today
