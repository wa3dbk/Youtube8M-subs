00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.700
 wallays hi to all these nations get 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 find for a new video and that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 was very very long 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.679
 I give you the rope but it's a video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.360
 Explanatory 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.880
 good day right now you can 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.000
 open a new tab on your 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.020
 favorite browser crom xl 2003 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.359
 Just to explain to you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.180
 am here to explain the reasons 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.250
 of my absence since we can say that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.989
 I had an absence 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.460
 a prolonged absence of ray on su on 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.200
 the duration of about two or three months there 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 seems to me 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.040
 why one why I told you nothing 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 and that's a mistake 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 finally I was on twitter I was on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
 twitter but I should have made you a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.160
 video rather and wise we excuse but 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.010
 I had very personal reasons a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.289
 huge lack lack of time and so 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 that's why for one more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.540
 period there is not much to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.450
 because 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.000
 ag have a bac period passed a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.610
 bac 2 period first so that's going ya 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.280
 worse but I still prefer to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.070
 well in the bath what I 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.420
 focus on that to make my 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.050
 better what and I think I think back 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.840
 after making new videos 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.540
 except big problem so here's me 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.240
 I want to come back now 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.659
 the little world of youtube 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.460
 that's why I think back if 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.950
 you said two things the ideas of 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.990
 things I could do I was not 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.220
 put it in comment 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 do not hesitate to share to share 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 this video either because it would be 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 although the maximum number of people are at 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 current I'm going back in not bad 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.479
 of time in a lot of time in little 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.100
 of time 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.300
 yes then there you see there I have not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.190
 turn longer I lost 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.950
 speaking habits it's not good we're going 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.500
 do I re-learn to speak so 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.950
 this is just to tell you that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.259
 simply by diligence because I 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880
 prefer to tell you things and you 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.840
 deserve it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.280
 so here's the friends then I'm going all 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.080
 just tell you next time everything 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.920
 right away because in this video there 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.489
 I do not have much more to say to you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 I will see if within a month finally after 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.440
 the bac period I will post videos 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.780
 it turns out I put videos between 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 two because I want to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.870
 so I 'll see I may have clean and 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.959
 to prepare projects but nothing good 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.880
 outstanding at the moment there is my 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.040
 bac period I'm concentrating I'm 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.650
 concentrate on it and after we see I 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.390
 see what I'm doing so here I am 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.410
 repeat at least too much of at least three 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.430
 times play on a fart at least three 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.650
 times since the beginning of the video but 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.040

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.780
