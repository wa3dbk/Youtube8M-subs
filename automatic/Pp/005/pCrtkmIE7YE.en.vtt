00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
should be the main villain or the final

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.439 
should be the main villain or the final
villain<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.649> series<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.300> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but the thing is when these flashbacks

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
but the thing is when these flashbacks
start<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> come<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.729> droves<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> people

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
they think that does this mean that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.399 
they think that does this mean that
kobato<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.790> actually<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> die<00:01:15.780> soon<00:01:16.140> and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
learned a slew of new techniques and
that's<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.869> even<00:02:01.020> counting<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.590> fact<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that's not even counting the fact that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160

more<00:02:05.820> secret<00:02:06.270> tricks<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.780> his<00:02:06.899> sleeve<00:02:07.170> which

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
more secret tricks up his sleeve which

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.740 
more secret tricks up his sleeve which
leads<00:02:08.399> me<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> believe<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.509> think

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
leads me to believe that I don't think

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.430 
leads me to believe that I don't think
he's<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.470> beaten<00:02:10.979> by<00:02:11.009> Itachi

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
he's going to be beaten by Itachi

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.050 
he's going to be beaten by Itachi
or<00:02:12.530> Sasuke<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.220> fact<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.580> think<00:02:13.760> he's<00:02:13.880> actually

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
or Sasuke in fact I think he's actually

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.550 
or Sasuke in fact I think he's actually
going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.810> top<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.260> battle

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
going to come out on top in the battle

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to come out on top in the battle
or<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:15.680> least<00:02:15.860> that's<00:02:16.040> what<00:02:16.160> I'm<00:02:16.250> hoping<00:02:16.310> for

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
or at least that's what I'm hoping for

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.910 
or at least that's what I'm hoping for
and<00:02:17.180> that's<00:02:17.630> because<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.960> want<00:02:18.260> Caputo<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.830> be

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
and that's because I want Caputo to be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.190 
and that's because I want Caputo to be
the<00:02:19.100> final<00:02:19.700> ultimate<00:02:20.270> villain<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.810> series

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the final ultimate villain of the series

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.310 
the final ultimate villain of the series
which<00:02:21.890> will<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.700> way<00:02:22.970> also<00:02:23.510> result<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.140> row

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
which will in a way also result in a row

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.960 
which will in a way also result in a row
chamorro<00:02:24.860> coming<00:02:25.280> back<00:02:25.460> but<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:25.790> where

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
chamorro coming back but that's where

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.940 
chamorro coming back but that's where
this<00:02:26.090> whole<00:02:26.150> freaky<00:02:26.930> theory<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.410> mine<00:02:27.650> comes

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
this whole freaky theory of mine comes

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.130 
this whole freaky theory of mine comes
into<00:02:28.250> play<00:02:28.430> personally<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:29.960> have<00:02:30.110> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
into play personally if I could have it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.650 
into play personally if I could have it
my<00:02:30.290> way<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.650> would<00:02:30.920> be<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.660> somehow

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
my way it would be like this somehow

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.270 
my way it would be like this somehow
he's<00:02:33.050> going<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.350> find<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.680> way<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> defeat

capital<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.920> just<00:03:25.100> think<00:03:25.280> he's<00:03:25.400> too<00:03:25.610> much<00:03:25.820> of<00:03:25.880> an

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
capital I just think he's too much of an

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.510 
capital I just think he's too much of an
important<00:03:26.600> villain<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.280> Cavuto<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
important villain and Cavuto is the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.190 
important villain and Cavuto is the
reason<00:03:28.820> for<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.330> that's<00:03:29.750> why<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.930> just

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
reason for that and that's why I just

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.540 
reason for that and that's why I just
don't<00:03:30.350> think<00:03:30.530> he's<00:03:30.620> gonna<00:03:30.770> die<00:03:30.980> yet<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.459> I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
don't think he's gonna die yet and I
