00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
running him directly he'd start shooting

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.719 
running him directly he'd start shooting
me<00:01:32.779> too<00:01:32.959> and<00:01:33.139> again<00:01:33.560> that's<00:01:33.679> a<00:01:33.799> 2v1<00:01:34.099> situation

if he had a natural he may have been

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.380 
if he had a natural he may have been

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
arm so the best the best thing they do

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.279 
arm so the best the best thing they do
right<00:06:00.969> there<00:06:01.150> is<00:06:01.270> just<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.599> kind<00:06:01.810> of<00:06:01.870> fire

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
right there is just to kind of fire

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.200 
right there is just to kind of fire
around<00:06:02.529> trying<00:06:02.979> to<00:06:03.069> hit<00:06:03.279> his<00:06:03.400> arm<00:06:03.430> because<00:06:04.000> if

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
around trying to hit his arm because if

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.969 
around trying to hit his arm because if
he's<00:06:04.599> already<00:06:04.810> hurt<00:06:05.139> it<00:06:05.529> only<00:06:05.680> takes<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.949> little

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
he's already hurt it only takes a little

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.480 
he's already hurt it only takes a little
bit<00:06:06.310> more<00:06:06.460> until<00:06:06.759> it<00:06:06.909> takes<00:06:07.240> him<00:06:07.389> down<00:06:07.539> and<00:06:08.490> get

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
bit more until it takes him down and get

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.390 
bit more until it takes him down and get
that<00:06:09.550> was<00:06:09.879> actually<00:06:10.000> really<00:06:10.210> good<00:06:11.250> place<00:06:12.250> to

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
that was actually really good place to

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.010 
that was actually really good place to
back<00:06:12.550> away<00:06:12.729> because<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.180> saw<00:06:13.360> at<00:06:13.629> least<00:06:13.840> one

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
back away because I saw at least one

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.830 
back away because I saw at least one
more<00:06:14.169> enemy<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:14.650> obviously<00:06:15.639> that's<00:06:16.389> that's

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
more enemy and obviously that's that's

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.209 
more enemy and obviously that's that's
not<00:06:17.050> what<00:06:17.289> you<00:06:17.440> want<00:06:17.620> to<00:06:17.680> do<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:17.949> don't<00:06:18.099> want

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
not what you want to do you don't want

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:21.809 
not what you want to do you don't want
to<00:06:18.310> charge<00:06:18.550> head<00:06:18.819> on<00:06:18.969> into<00:06:19.300> battle<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:20.819> think

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
to charge head on into battle I think

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.790 
to charge head on into battle I think
maybe<00:06:22.449> even<00:06:22.719> more<00:06:22.900> than<00:06:22.960> call<00:06:23.259> of<00:06:23.289> duty<00:06:23.650> this

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
maybe even more than call of duty this

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.680 
maybe even more than call of duty this
