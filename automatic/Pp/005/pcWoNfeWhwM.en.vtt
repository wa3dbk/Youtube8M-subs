worth it
um<00:00:35.540> weight<00:00:36.540> reducing<00:00:37.050> gear<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.530> great<00:00:37.800> also

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
um weight reducing gear is great also

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
um weight reducing gear is great also
you<00:00:38.640> need<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> glory<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.750> teleport

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you need a glory so you can teleport

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
you need a glory so you can teleport
back<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.440> yeah<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> lodestone

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
back here yeah you can use the lodestone

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.340 
back here yeah you can use the lodestone
but<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> prefer<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> glory<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.110> it's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
but I prefer the glory because it's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
but I prefer the glory because it's
technically<00:00:44.010> free<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
technically free because you can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
technically free because you can
recharge<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> resell<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.739> faster

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
recharge and resell and it's faster

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
recharge and resell and it's faster
teleports<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.930> just<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> stack<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
teleports and just have a stack of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.779 
teleports and just have a stack of
glories<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.039> bank<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
glories in your bank and also have a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.389 
glories in your bank and also have a
stack<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> pure<00:00:51.420> essence<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.039> you<00:00:53.039> probably

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
stack of pure essence so you probably

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
stack of pure essence so you probably
have<00:00:53.520> done<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.820> abyss<00:00:54.149> before<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
have done the abyss before but you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
have done the abyss before but you
probably<00:00:55.530> didn't<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.399> doing<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
probably didn't think of doing this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.420 
probably didn't think of doing this
method<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.230> test<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> ditch<00:00:58.980> you've

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
method so you go test the ditch you've

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
method so you go test the ditch you've
done<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> fricken<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.199> before<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
done the fricken of this before if you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
done the fricken of this before if you
haven't<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> haven't<00:01:02.489> played

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
haven't then you haven't played

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.310 
haven't then you haven't played
runescape<00:01:02.879> anyways<00:01:03.510> umm<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.019> would<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
runescape anyways umm it would be

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
runescape anyways umm it would be
beneficial<00:01:04.470> also<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.600> possibly<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.869> your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
beneficial also to possibly make your

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
beneficial also to possibly make your
inventory<00:01:07.500> smaller<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.850> map

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
inventory smaller and make your map

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
inventory smaller and make your map
giant<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.930> don't<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> click<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.710> much

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
giant so you don't have to click as much

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 
giant so you don't have to click as much
to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> places<00:01:11.750> I'm<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.110> showing<00:01:13.290> you

woodcut and same with agility and all
those<00:01:25.200> things<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> prefer<00:01:26.909> the

those things but it's just I prefer the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
those things but it's just I prefer the
mining<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.780> 50<00:01:28.080> mining<00:01:28.380> or

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
mining one because you get 50 mining or

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
mining one because you get 50 mining or
25<00:01:28.860> mining<00:01:29.220> speed<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.329> actually

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
25 mining speed which it's actually

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.580 
25 mining speed which it's actually
worth<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.400> cosmic<00:01:32.750> altar<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> on

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
worth it so the cosmic altar thing is on

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
worth it so the cosmic altar thing is on
the<00:01:34.799> west<00:01:35.009> side<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> BIST<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.479> keep<00:01:37.290> on

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the west side of the BIST so I keep on

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.749 
the west side of the BIST so I keep on
teleporting<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> west<00:01:38.250> side<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.610> that's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
teleporting on the west side so that's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.600 
teleporting on the west side so that's
fine<00:01:38.909> West<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.299> eat<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.229> um<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:41.520> at

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
fine West I eat and then um so you're at

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
fine West I eat and then um so you're at
the<00:01:41.729> altar<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.570> craft<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the altar and then you just craft it

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.679 
the altar and then you just craft it
like<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> normally<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
like you normally would and then I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
like you normally would and then I
usually<00:01:46.229> empty<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.180> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
usually empty this and then just do that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.160 
usually empty this and then just do that
quick<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:51.170> so

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
quick and then and then I do this so

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
quick and then and then I do this so
they<00:01:52.259> fit<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:53.790> empties<00:01:54.090> for

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
they fit so it's about three empties for

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170 
they fit so it's about three empties for
me<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.860> could<00:01:56.100> probably<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.549> faster<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
me and I could probably do it faster I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.310 
me and I could probably do it faster I
just<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:58.140> preferred<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.619> way<00:01:58.770> um<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
just just preferred this way um so you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.209 
just just preferred this way um so you
with<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.250> method<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.000> 69<00:02:04.219> perfect

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
with this method you can do 69 perfect

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819 
with this method you can do 69 perfect
number<00:02:05.460> 69<00:02:05.880> route<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.750> pure<00:02:06.960> essence<00:02:07.229> per<00:02:07.560> trip

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
number 69 route of pure essence per trip

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.210 
number 69 route of pure essence per trip
that<00:02:08.039> means<00:02:08.190> 138<00:02:08.940> cosmic<00:02:09.720> runes<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.229> look<00:02:11.129> at

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that means 138 cosmic runes and look at

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.300 
that means 138 cosmic runes and look at
this<00:02:11.400> okay

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this okay

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.890 
this okay
because<00:02:12.880> you're<00:02:13.000> making<00:02:13.240> double<00:02:13.569> that's<00:02:13.780> how

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
because you're making double that's how

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600 
because you're making double that's how
much<00:02:14.050> profit<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.590> mean<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.069> how<00:02:15.160> much<00:02:15.340> money

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
much profit I mean that's how much money

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.820 
much profit I mean that's how much money
you<00:02:15.819> get<00:02:15.940> per<00:02:16.180> trip<00:02:16.420> -<00:02:16.959> 4<00:02:17.200> K<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.650> pure

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you get per trip - 4 K for the pure

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.610 
you get per trip - 4 K for the pure
essence<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> you're<00:02:19.780> making<00:02:19.840> 21<00:02:20.410> K

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
essence that's it so you're making 21 K

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.240 
essence that's it so you're making 21 K
per<00:02:20.800> trip<00:02:21.040> which<00:02:21.390> evens<00:02:22.390> out<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.720> about<00:02:23.250> 1.25

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
per trip which evens out to about 1.25

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.300 
per trip which evens out to about 1.25
mil<00:02:24.850> an<00:02:25.000> hour<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.420> I'm<00:02:25.990> just<00:02:26.230> put<00:02:26.920> an<00:02:26.980> average

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
mil an hour so I'm just put an average

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.520 
mil an hour so I'm just put an average
1.2<00:02:27.850> mil<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.600> reason<00:02:28.840> why<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.380> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
1.2 mil the reason why you can do that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.400 
1.2 mil the reason why you can do that
is<00:02:29.739> because<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.330> trip<00:02:31.630> every<00:02:31.989> 60

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
is because you can do one trip every 60

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.300 
is because you can do one trip every 60
seconds<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:35.410> fast<00:02:35.709> as<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.950> can<00:02:36.130> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
seconds if you do as fast as you can and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
seconds if you do as fast as you can and
also<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.060> other<00:02:37.270> beneficial<00:02:37.930> thing<00:02:38.080> about

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
also the other beneficial thing about

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400 
also the other beneficial thing about
this<00:02:38.440> method<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.489> get<00:02:39.730> 33<00:02:40.720> K<00:02:40.959> runecrafting

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
this method is you get 33 K runecrafting

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.520 
this method is you get 33 K runecrafting
XP<00:02:42.100> per<00:02:42.280> hour<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.910> get<00:02:43.090> 1.2<00:02:43.720> mil<00:02:43.900> DP<00:02:44.380> per

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
XP per hour if you get 1.2 mil DP per

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.040 
XP per hour if you get 1.2 mil DP per
hour<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.890> also<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.250> 33<00:02:45.850> K<00:02:46.060> or<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.330> crafting<00:02:46.810> XP

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
hour you also get 33 K or in crafting XP

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.130 
hour you also get 33 K or in crafting XP
per<00:02:47.170> hour<00:02:47.320> which<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.959> bad

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
per hour which that is not that bad

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.020 
per hour which that is not that bad
comparable<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> runespan<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.610> terrible

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
comparable the runespan that is terrible

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.759 
comparable the runespan that is terrible
but<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.480> thing<00:02:52.600> about<00:02:52.630> you're<00:02:52.959> making<00:02:53.260> 1.2

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
but the thing about you're making 1.2

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.590 
but the thing about you're making 1.2
mil<00:02:53.920> an<00:02:54.010> hour<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.150> span<00:02:55.330> you<00:02:55.450> make

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
mil an hour or in span you make

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.020 
mil an hour or in span you make
absolutely<00:02:55.959> no<00:02:56.170> money<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.310> actually<00:02:57.580> if<00:02:57.940> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
absolutely no money so I actually if I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.850 
absolutely no money so I actually if I
was<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.330> for<00:02:58.450> 99<00:02:58.750> runecrafting<00:02:58.900> again<00:02:59.530> like

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
was going for 99 runecrafting again like

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.090 
was going for 99 runecrafting again like
I'm<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.190> but<00:03:00.519> if<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:00.910> had<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.360> UM<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:02.470> would

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
I'm not but if I had to UM I would

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.860 
I'm not but if I had to UM I would
probably<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.760> method<00:03:04.000> because<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.690> not

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
probably do this method because it's not

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.199 
probably do this method because it's not
that<00:03:05.080> slow<00:03:05.350> 33<00:03:05.980> K<00:03:06.100> an<00:03:06.190> hour<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.519> not<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.790> bad

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
that slow 33 K an hour is not that bad

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.540 
that slow 33 K an hour is not that bad
and<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.319> also<00:03:08.470> get<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.920> money<00:03:09.100> just

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
and you also get all that money just

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.710 
and you also get all that money just
think<00:03:09.700> about<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:09.970> like<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> old<00:03:10.330> double

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
think about it's like the old double

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.110 
think about it's like the old double
Nats<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.260> thing<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.730> cosmics<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.880> like<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
Nats and thing is cosmics are like the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.190 
Nats and thing is cosmics are like the
best<00:03:13.269> thing<00:03:13.420> they<00:03:13.600> do<00:03:13.720> right<00:03:13.900> now<00:03:14.019> because

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
best thing they do right now because

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.740 
best thing they do right now because
they're<00:03:15.100> 180<00:03:15.730> each<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.299> make<00:03:16.450> two<00:03:16.660> of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
they're 180 each and you make two of

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.870 
they're 180 each and you make two of
them<00:03:16.840> at<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.200> very<00:03:17.290> low<00:03:17.650> level<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.100> hopefully

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
them at a very low level so hopefully

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.850 
them at a very low level so hopefully
