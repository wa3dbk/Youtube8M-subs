00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.479 
process but you'll see as we go on here
a<00:02:07.090> little<00:02:07.270> bit<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.380> know<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.830> kind<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.250> got

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
a little bit that you know I kind of got

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.270 
a little bit that you know I kind of got
my<00:02:09.640> feel<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.630> got<00:02:10.899> laid<00:02:11.200> down<00:02:11.470> pretty

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
my feel for it and got laid down pretty

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460 
my feel for it and got laid down pretty
good<00:02:12.519> but<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.269> want<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> try<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.840> keep<00:02:14.050> see

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
good but you want to try and keep see

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.090 
good but you want to try and keep see
like<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.830> had<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:15.430> fire<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.380 

yeah<00:02:21.100> sometimes<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.730> don't<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.120> back<00:02:22.360> up

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
yeah sometimes I don't have to back up

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.300 
yeah sometimes I don't have to back up
that<00:02:22.660> door<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.410> believe<00:02:23.650> that's<00:02:23.769> how<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.010> got

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that door and I believe that's how I got

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.400 
that door and I believe that's how I got
nailed<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.090> because<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.750> know<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.110> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
nailed to because you know then just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.960 
nailed to because you know then just
sitting<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.769> shooting<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> shooting<00:02:27.760> and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
sitting the shooting the shooting and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.600 
sitting the shooting the shooting and
they<00:02:28.540> buy<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.810> greech<00:02:29.410> pastor<00:02:30.220> or<00:02:30.370> your

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
they buy the greech pastor or your

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.990 
they buy the greech pastor or your
chokehold<00:02:31.239> point<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.810> there<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.610> know<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.760> I

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
chokehold point up there so you know I I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.699 
chokehold point up there so you know I I
pondered<00:02:34.690> right<00:02:34.930> about<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.350> time<00:02:35.410> of

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
pondered right about this time of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.759 
pondered right about this time of
opening<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.760> door<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.360> leaving<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.170> you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
you're going to see here how it can go

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.810 
you're going to see here how it can go
awry<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.500> want<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.800> try<00:04:30.979> and<00:04:31.130> keep<00:04:31.280> that<00:04:31.520> fire

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
up there as far ahead as possible but

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.650 
up there as far ahead as possible but
when<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:35.990> start<00:04:36.289> shooting<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.220> see<00:04:37.820> they

when you start shooting here see they
start<00:04:39.050> they'll<00:04:39.919> start<00:04:40.250> breaching<00:04:40.760> through<00:04:41.060> it

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
they just keep on pushing forward so

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.460 
they just keep on pushing forward so
itself<00:04:43.910> being<00:04:44.210> effective<00:04:44.840> at<00:04:44.960> this<00:04:45.140> point

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470

drug<00:05:45.080> techniques<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.920> whatnot<00:05:46.280> but<00:05:46.880> when

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
drug techniques and whatnot but when

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.880 
drug techniques and whatnot but when
you're<00:05:47.390> good<00:05:47.630> when<00:05:47.750> you're<00:05:47.990> doing<00:05:48.650> this<00:05:48.830> just

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
you're good when you're doing this just

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.120 
you're good when you're doing this just
come<00:05:49.460> over<00:05:49.610> here<00:05:49.730> and<00:05:50.270> keep<00:05:51.260> him<00:05:51.440> behind<00:05:51.470> you

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
come over here and keep him behind you

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.820 
come over here and keep him behind you
do<00:05:52.670> a<00:05:52.700> lap<00:05:53.060> around<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.900> this<00:05:54.260> is<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.650> best

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
do a lap around and this is the best

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.400 
do a lap around and this is the best
fire<00:05:55.250> trap<00:05:55.670> for<00:05:56.000> running<00:05:56.330> a<00:05:56.390> circle<00:05:56.900> ok<00:05:57.200> I

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
fire trap for running a circle ok I

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.980 
fire trap for running a circle ok I
think<00:05:57.920> in<00:05:58.010> my<00:05:58.100> previous<00:05:58.550> videos<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.480> with<00:05:59.840> the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
think in my previous videos I with the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.600 
think in my previous videos I with the
fire<00:06:00.260> I<00:06:00.620> killed<00:06:01.160> them<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:01.820> front<00:06:02.540> of<00:06:03.280> jug<00:06:04.280> where

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
fire I killed them in front of jug where

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.440 
fire I killed them in front of jug where
the<00:06:04.820> best<00:06:05.180> von<00:06:05.510> spot<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.170> but<00:06:07.160> I<00:06:07.400> I<00:06:07.730> realized

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
the best von spot is but I I realized

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.810 
the best von spot is but I I realized
that<00:06:08.780> it's<00:06:08.960> much<00:06:09.320> better<00:06:09.620> at<00:06:09.920> this<00:06:10.100> chokehold

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
that it's much better at this chokehold

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.790 
that it's much better at this chokehold
point<00:06:11.120> right<00:06:11.360> here<00:06:11.390> and<00:06:12.020> you<00:06:12.050> just<00:06:12.470> like<00:06:12.650> a

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
point right here and you just like a

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.890 
point right here and you just like a
three-shot<00:06:13.730> burst<00:06:14.120> you<00:06:14.390> don't<00:06:14.540> need<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:14.780> lay

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
three-shot burst you don't need to lay

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.950 
three-shot burst you don't need to lay
down<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:15.260> six<00:06:15.650> like<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.490> had<00:06:16.730> two<00:06:17.030> over<00:06:17.360> here<00:06:17.390> you

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
down of six like I had two over here you

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.600

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
next up I have a video for the high

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.260 
next up I have a video for the high
rounds<00:07:03.240> using<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:04.320> robot<00:07:04.920> high-speed<00:07:05.820> robot

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
rounds using the robot high-speed robot

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.960 
rounds using the robot high-speed robot
traps<00:07:06.690> and<00:07:07.140> some<00:07:07.980> of<00:07:08.100> the<00:07:08.160> techniques<00:07:08.640> for

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
traps and some of the techniques for

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.960 
traps and some of the techniques for
doing<00:07:09.180> that<00:07:09.510> but<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:10.650> figured<00:07:11.040> I<00:07:11.310> had<00:07:11.850> the

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
doing that but I figured I had the

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.270 
doing that but I figured I had the
footage<00:07:12.240> for<00:07:12.570> this<00:07:12.750> for<00:07:13.560> this<00:07:13.620> game<00:07:13.860> that<00:07:14.160> I'm

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
footage for this for this game that I'm

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.000 
footage for this for this game that I'm
doing<00:07:14.970> now<00:07:15.300> and<00:07:15.330> I<00:07:15.840> wanted<00:07:16.560> a<00:07:16.620> little<00:07:16.800> more

doing now and I wanted a little more

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.800 
doing now and I wanted a little more
footage<00:07:17.490> from<00:07:17.940> her<00:07:18.120> for<00:07:18.420> a<00:07:18.450> few<00:07:18.630> different

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
footage from her for a few different

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.870 
footage from her for a few different
techniques<00:07:19.140> I<00:07:19.560> wasn't<00:07:19.830> able<00:07:19.920> to<00:07:20.130> capture<00:07:20.430> on

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
techniques I wasn't able to capture on

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.780 
techniques I wasn't able to capture on
that<00:07:21.060> other<00:07:21.210> one<00:07:21.450> so<00:07:21.990> i<00:07:22.320> was<00:07:23.010> asking<00:07:23.430> i<00:07:23.550> played
