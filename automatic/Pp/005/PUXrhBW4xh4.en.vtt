00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:12.265
 Last season ... 

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:19.209
 O leee leee olaa laaa 

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:25.291
 ser del Barça éees el millor que hi haaaa! 

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:33.183
 Let's see ... Míster took us here to get away from football 

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:36.339
 and it turns out that these monks are more passionate than Boixos Nois. 

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:38.126
 A small paradox 

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.638
 Old, Inieste, I do not think it's that way 

00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:43.587
 No? Have you seen the stained glass windows here? 

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:47.930
 Damn ... They remind me of someone but I do not know who. 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.217
 Photo! 

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.929
 Who else wants my autograph? 

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:57.289
 We chilled too much. We'll come to Wembley and Manchester will kick our butts. 

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:03.115
 Not at all, Pep. As the fifth verse of the book of Deuteronomy says: 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.351
 "Those from Manchester are a band and Pep's people will scatter their manitas" 

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.292
 You see, Mister, this is even the book of this pepperoni. 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.737
 Basta! Okay boys, we're going to Laporty's house, there's definitely not going to be as much fun as here. 

00:01:17.602 --> 00:01:22.529
 No no no no! Please, Pep. We apologize if we have hurt you, but we still have one more surprise ... 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:23.801
 No, I've had enough! 

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:30.040
 I have enough of Gregorian blaugrana songs, autographs, stained glass with players, and the Holy Bible Culé. It's enough! 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.840
 No, no, no ... it's nothing like that. 

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:33.149
 Fortunately. 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.624
 It's even better: a musical performance. 

00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:48.830
 It's only in two weeks, 

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:51.030
 but we feel like it. 

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:53.550
 Euphoria prevails on Montserrat. 

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.440
 You said to the stands, 

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.390
 that you are one of them. 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.210
 Unless you have not forgotten? 

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.200
 That is some madness. 

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:06.240
 I am asking for reason. 

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.810
 We must play this finale. 

00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:11.600
 They will ask for mercy. 

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:13.470
 I have a feeling, 

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.390
 that we will win without effort. 

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:18.770
 At Wembley! 

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.710
 We can get there by bus. 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.610
 At Wembley! 

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.620
 Or by plane, but then it will be more expensive. 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.240
 At Wembley! 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.240
 At Wembley! 

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:28.520
 We can now open champagne! 

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:29.960
 At Wembley! 

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.100
 The fourth will come to us this year! 

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:33.770
 At Wembley! 

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:35.940
 Guys, we can not be sure of anything. 

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.440
 At Wembley! 

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.780
 I have good goals there. 

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.200
 At Wembley! 

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.560
 I will be in the starting lineup. 

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:44.810
 On We ... 

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:48.100
 Hey, now you overreacted with this optimism, old man! 

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:49.300
 Well actually ... 

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:51.640
 At Wembley! 

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.080
 At Wembley! 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.380
 But it will comfort me. * 

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:02.930
 At Wembley! 

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.110
 I do not want to say anything anymore. 

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.850
 At Wembley! 

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.910
 Be careful with the bus. 

00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:10.260
 At Wembley! 

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.480
 That would not slip away. 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.280
 At Wembley!
