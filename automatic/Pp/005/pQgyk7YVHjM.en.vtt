00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.899
 the call to strike 

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.569
 three weeks after the short-term entry of which we are at 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.569
 the antenna it did not announce yet in this optics it's gone 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.389

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.189
 was possible we burn to meet our invitation here 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.060
 it's about 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 philippe dana dawson looks haggard 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.470
 but 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 this is our first rehearsal 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.510
 preparing our great country to settle there in memory of May 6, 2007 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.520
 a day that will remain paracha may be engraved in our memories 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 she 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.769
 m 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.570
 all that for that is heavy to wear 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.080
 it's the story of this music 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.090
 everything started digging 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.530
 francois pecqueur who is not in the fall a book is the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 co-organizer of this conference 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.280
 if François du travail 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.610
 tonight is that he was held in Toulon receives 2 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.840
 So he is judged with 40 other people 71st here is the man 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.230
 I believe two companies think that it causes astonishment the 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.910
 season 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.100
 he will keep abreast back to wait ap the president he owns 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.360
 also patent 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 56 40 euros 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.420
 I know 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 christophe barbier 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.880
 yes yes you have heard perfectly 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 does our president have five or six brains 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 and two others are more 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 he feels perfectly thq 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 you will find this organization 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.760
 in the park h 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.170
 from 7 5% to 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.910
 I think it's done 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.460
 m 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.550
 but other presidents in earlier on Monday so what is what 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.909
 this charity joke 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.060
 these few lines 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.349
 jean-paul everything is gone from there 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 now it just happens the young prodigy good product 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.789
 so 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.090
 but our president is also prodigy 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.179
 since his semantic redemption 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.819
 so far so with its magnitude 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.749
 when it comes to passing a law 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:37.579
 whose consequence this report blames social unprecedented 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.279
 in the field of labor law 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.659
 when this growth is running on the heads of all unions 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.109
 and when this choir is special the 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.289
 of social technocracy 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:53.519
 then there we can not accuse in Catalan 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.619

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:48.249
