stuff<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:38.110> going<00:01:42.090> remember<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.270> only<00:01:43.390> a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
stuff in going remember this is only a

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.560 
stuff in going remember this is only a
one<00:01:43.750> minute<00:01:43.870> clip<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.910> if<00:01:45.910> there's<00:01:46.150> only<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.360> one

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
one minute clip so if there's only a one

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.120 
one minute clip so if there's only a one
second<00:01:46.960> difference<00:01:47.260> between<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.740> two<00:01:47.920> you've

second difference between the two you've

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.370 
second difference between the two you've
got<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.310> multiply<00:01:48.730> that<00:01:48.880> over<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:50.020> length<00:01:50.200> of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
video it's one second difference it's

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.570

going<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.590> 60<00:01:56.920> seconds<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:57.430> it's

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
going to be 60 seconds if it's

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.570 
going to be 60 seconds if it's
difference<00:01:58.030> over<00:01:58.180> an<00:01:58.360> hour<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.250> at<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.430> moment

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.040 
going to run through the mic vantage
just<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> cpu<00:03:22.740> test<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.490> get<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> school<00:03:24.050> i'm

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
just the cpu test to get a school i'm

canon<00:04:05.280> HD<00:04:05.790> files<00:04:06.360> now<00:04:06.660> which<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:06.960> used<00:04:07.140> which

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
canon HD files now which we used which

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.700 
canon HD files now which we used which
used<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:08.640> really<00:04:09.090> hard<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.450> run<00:04:09.710> premier

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
used to be really hard to run premier

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.890 
used to be really hard to run premier
had<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> hard<00:04:11.130> time<00:04:11.190> running<00:04:11.790> them<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.270> even

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
had a hard time running them and even

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.090 
had a hard time running them and even
you<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.440> little<00:04:13.560> preview<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:14.010> the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
you know the little preview in the

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.250 
you know the little preview in the
corner<00:04:14.490> used<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.270> run<00:04:15.390> like<00:04:15.540> five<00:04:15.840> frames<00:04:16.080> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
corner used to run like five frames a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.490 
corner used to run like five frames a
second<00:04:17.660> now<00:04:18.660> you're<00:04:18.810> getting<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.080> good<00:04:19.260> 20

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
second now you're getting a good 20

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.690 
second now you're getting a good 20
frames<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.830> second<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.280> makes<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.580> lot

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
frames a second that makes it a lot

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.690 
frames a second that makes it a lot
easier<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:21.000> editing
