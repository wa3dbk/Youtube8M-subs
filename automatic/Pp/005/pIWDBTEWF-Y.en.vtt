an ipod nano 5th generation and this is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.890 
an ipod nano 5th generation and this is
the<00:00:16.500> 4th<00:00:16.740> generation<00:00:16.980> now<00:00:17.970> take<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.750> through

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the 4th generation now take you through

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.060 
the 4th generation now take you through
some<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> differences<00:00:19.500> between<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> two

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
some of the differences between the two

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.439 
some of the differences between the two
most<00:00:20.760> notably<00:00:21.240> being<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.750> camera<00:00:22.199> right<00:00:22.410> here

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
most notably being the camera right here

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.970 
most notably being the camera right here
kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.630> odd<00:00:24.810> place<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.470> camera

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
kind of an odd place for a camera

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
kind of an odd place for a camera
especially<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> consider<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.750> screen

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
especially when you consider the screen

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
especially when you consider the screen
is<00:00:28.199> over<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.010> little

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is over here it's a little

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
is over here it's a little
counterintuitive<00:00:30.500> when<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> consider<00:00:31.890> how

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
counterintuitive when you consider how

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
counterintuitive when you consider how
most<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.790> used<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.149> holding<00:00:33.480> their

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
most people are used to holding their

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.280 
most people are used to holding their
cameras<00:00:34.489> now<00:00:35.489> Apple<00:00:36.300> basically<00:00:36.899> just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cameras now Apple basically just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
cameras now Apple basically just
blindsided<00:00:37.950> everybody<00:00:38.489> unless<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> were

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
blindsided everybody unless you were

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.209 
blindsided everybody unless you were
following<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> rumors<00:00:39.989> online<00:00:40.230> most

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
following the rumors online most

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.580 
following the rumors online most
consumers<00:00:41.820> were<00:00:42.000> blindsided<00:00:42.329> about<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.440> days

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
consumers were blindsided about two days

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.049 
consumers were blindsided about two days
ago<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.239> 9909<00:00:46.219> with<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.520> addition<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
ago on 9909 with the addition of the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
ago on 9909 with the addition of the
camera<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> Nano<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.110> lot<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> people

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
camera to the Nano a lot of people

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.170 
camera to the Nano a lot of people
thought<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> ipod<00:00:50.640> touch<00:00:50.850> would<00:00:51.030> have

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
thought that the ipod touch would have

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.939 
thought that the ipod touch would have
it<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.719> turns<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:53.129> didn't

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
it but it turns out that it didn't

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.350 
it but it turns out that it didn't
alright<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> prices<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:56.910> basically<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
alright so the prices are basically the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410 
alright so the prices are basically the
same<00:00:57.750> between<00:00:58.469> these<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.859> devices<00:00:59.160> now<00:01:00.000> as

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
same between these two devices now as

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.579 
same between these two devices now as
you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.320> they're<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> same<00:01:02.039> sizes

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
you can see they're the same sizes

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.640 
you can see they're the same sizes
however<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> things<00:01:07.409> end

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
however just because a lot of things end

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
however just because a lot of things end
up<00:01:07.740> being<00:01:07.950> similar<00:01:08.310> doesn't<00:01:08.640> mean<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
up being similar doesn't mean that this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.640 
up being similar doesn't mean that this
might<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.960> worthwhile<00:01:10.170> upgrade

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
might not be a worthwhile upgrade

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
might not be a worthwhile upgrade
especially<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.909> consider<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
especially when you consider all the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.560 
especially when you consider all the
extras<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> Apple<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.650> added<00:01:14.189> for<00:01:15.180> example

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
extras that Apple has added for example

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.399 
extras that Apple has added for example
you<00:01:15.750> notice<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> screen<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.920> larger<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
you notice that the screen is larger and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.460 
you notice that the screen is larger and
it<00:01:19.409> looks<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:20.790> thinner<00:01:21.600> too<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it looks it looks thinner too but it's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
it looks it looks thinner too but it's
actually<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.090> effect<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
actually not that's just in an effect of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
actually not that's just in an effect of
what<00:01:25.200> happens<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.070> wheel<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> scroll<00:01:26.790> wheel

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what happens the wheel the scroll wheel

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300 
what happens the wheel the scroll wheel
seems<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:27.960> smaller<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> little

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
seems a little smaller and it's a little

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.450 
seems a little smaller and it's a little
offset<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.119> prior<00:01:30.990> generation<00:01:31.650> cases<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
offset so prior generation cases if you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
offset so prior generation cases if you
have<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> case<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.090> ipod<00:01:33.509> nano<00:01:33.720> 4th

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
have a case on your ipod nano 4th

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
have a case on your ipod nano 4th
generation<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.770> example<00:01:35.220> probably<00:01:36.210> won't

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
generation for example probably won't

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.679 
generation for example probably won't
work<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:38.000> not<00:01:39.000> probably<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.570> won't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
work on this one not probably it won't

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.249 
work on this one not probably it won't
work<00:01:40.490> another<00:01:41.490> thing<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> dock<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
work another thing if you have a dock to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.700 
work another thing if you have a dock to
consider<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:46.170> notice<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
consider is that you notice on the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.660 
consider is that you notice on the
bottom<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> 30<00:01:49.079> pin<00:01:49.320> connector<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
bottom here the 30 pin connector and the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.450 
bottom here the 30 pin connector and the
audio<00:01:51.030> port<00:01:51.509> has<00:01:51.750> been<00:01:51.990> switched<00:01:52.439> around<00:01:52.710> so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
audio port has been switched around so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.039 
audio port has been switched around so
that<00:01:53.700> might<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.000> concern<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that might be a concern if you have a

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.580 
that might be a concern if you have a
dock<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.470> home<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:57.119> probably<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.840> done<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
dock at home this probably was done to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.969 
dock at home this probably was done to
offset<00:01:59.219> room<00:01:59.460> inside<00:01:59.909> for<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.270> camera<00:02:00.979> now

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
offset room inside for the camera now

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
offset room inside for the camera now
the<00:02:02.040> camera<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> most<00:02:02.909> amazing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the camera is really the most amazing
