00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.700
 the witcher is one of these games 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.500
 adventures in which the players 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.510
 they will embody heroes had different 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.180
 exploits throughout a plagued world 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.100
 of monsters' problems and of different 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.529
 different type of tests to obtain 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.210
 a series of points score and so 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.519
 by the base as the champion or the king of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.109
 that world throughout the game a 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.970
 departure from the witcher remind others 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.859
 Adventure games like rumba or not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.390
 world of warcraft but have tried 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.640
 simplify things a bit to not 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.280
 bind with so much standard that deployment is 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.250
 simple is that there is a map a series of 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.230
 decks and a few more cards each hero 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.030
 will have to learn represented by a 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.640
 of these character tokens we have 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.920
 four choose that they will also mark us 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.900
 the actions during his turn the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.550
 goal of the witcher is to finish the 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.070
 starting with a greater pair with greater 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.440
 possible points as you see in this account 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.120
 marked with the character's tab and 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 to get points we will have to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.840
 solve adventures when a hero 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.520
 solve three adventures the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.350
 game and you will see who has more points 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.850
 the adventures are represented by 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 these tarot cards 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 each hero has a color on his tab 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.090
 indicates which deck you take and these chips 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.930
 these letters represent different 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.330
 adventures that heroes can live 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 come to earn points 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
 secondary heights to be able to say 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 complete while we are trying 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 complete the main and even some 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.790
 supporting adventure that will allow 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 other heroes in our location 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 make a joint adventure with us 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 and so we both earn points 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 the turn of the ebro comes marked by two 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.619
 actions are marked with these tokens and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 they will continue to mark on the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 character each character can have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 different actions for example that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.010
 we can mark travel that allow 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.600
 our hero move by a line 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.610
 and we can mark develop that 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.140
 will allow to receive letters of this March to 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.190
 have put their own mallet for 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 develop the character a little 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.729
 evolve not having more power 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 at the end as I say the 9 will have two 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.710
 actions that the objective may choose 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 end that is solve adventures is going 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.330
 fulfilling as they are getting 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.819
 chips that normally indicate in this 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.350
 section here to get those 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.550
 chips will have the book that you will have to 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.920
 investigate in different locations 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 each location has a magnifying glass and a 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 color then when a hero determines 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.500
 that in that location moves up 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.030
 there you can get a magnifying glass of that color 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.410
 or if several colors of the one you choose 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.290
 for example where is our hero 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.710
 will have a red magnifying glass a tab 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.170
 of red magnifying glass 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.150
 here I would get a high to violet here 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.220
 a blue magnifying glass here could choose between 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.360
 a blue a violet here could even 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.520
 choose between any of the three 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.220
 colors in a location like this 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510
 allows us to have two magnifying glasses 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.600
 we have special organizations that 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.490
 allow you to heal at the moment you 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 our hero will get a number of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.270
 magnifying glasses equal to the exchange rate of your 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.970
 tab for example our hero with three 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.160
 red magnifying glasses gets one of these chips 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 of the sword can make that change to catch 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.260
 those three chips return them and get to 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.840
 I change a sword token that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.520
 will allow to accumulate to solve the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 adventure that is how you see here your 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.330
 objective in this case have two the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.740
 moment you have it and it is in the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.300
 site indicate the adventure there will be 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.890
 fulfilled and will raise voting points 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.120
 as I say during the hero's turn 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.070
 You can do several things as they are 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.480
 move as is develop or even 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.400
 investigate in some area that is no more 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.860
 to take one of these letters that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.900
 they will have a series of tests once 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.980
 finished the turn his two actions the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.310
 hero will have to check if in his 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.380
 location there are monsters like these or 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.180
 chips of fateful destiny that takes the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.340
 letters of these as those can 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.650
 push the two things or you may not have 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.170
 none with which you will have to advance 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.900
 in this meter so that it is placed in 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.970
 that zone the combat that is the last thing 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.130
 it remains to tell us the simple the hero 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.600
 will have three combat states all 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.340
 heroes will have the same and they will have 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.320
 data of the delight for example 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.730
 It has three other red states 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.730
 heroes have a single die each of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.960
 your color will be stripped down we understand that 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.060
 check results that can be 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.440
 swords can be shields can be a 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.360
 luck of shield that will transform into 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.180
 shield with the help of a sword or 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.000
 diverse results 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.439
 by these these swords these 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.909
 shields we will compare them with the value 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.269
 of the monster can we defeat it or not 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.379
 taking us rewarded helping us punishment 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 when a hero as you say as I say 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.780
 complete three heights the game is 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.609
 ends and the one with the most points 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.680
 it's a pretty simple game 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.040
 understand and that will get us into this world 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.750
 of the witcher that allow us to live 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.870
 different heights in the skin of these 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.450
 wizard wizards based on the 78 in 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.450
