00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.579
 scratch resistance lag 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 contribution to scratch resistance 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 consists of a special resin with 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.750
 increased amount 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.059
 hardener to increase density 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.209
 cover 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:14.719
 even if the paintwork 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.669
 the coating is firm enough behind 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.320
 elasticity those who are not capable 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 resist scratch 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.210
 before applying the first coat of this 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.269
 Special locations use the usual 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 base coat method 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.669
 contribution to scratch resistance 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.519
 used as final 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.540
 cover 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660
 after drying, the milk usually went from 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.180
 surface using 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.630
 sandpaper gutters all along with 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.150
 those from one thousand to two thousand on the soft 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
 grinding 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.680
 mix stay ahead of you in 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.370
 proportions of one hundred and fifty add 20 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830
 percent thinners well 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.740
 is located 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
 since the amount of thinners is small 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.990
 use suitable for 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.210
 driver depending on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 temperatures 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.680
 use blends for transition points 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.900
 Latvia's diluted proportion blenders 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 become ten 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.040
 and a small diameter gun 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 eight-tenths of a millimeter 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.640
 mainly specified lag used to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.170
 panel application but if the details 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.030
 impossible to separate instead of transition 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.480
 exercise in narrow places such as 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 rear rack 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.640
 apply 2 3 coats of lacquer, giving an exposure between 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.570
 in layers 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.380
 add 20 30 for processing transition points 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.479
 percent thinners and you 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.479
 give birth to pole painting 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
 after lacquering work is completed 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.049
 the case of using this varnish is necessary 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.909
 use infrared dryers 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.539
 next mode 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.409
 first give an exposure of 10 to 20 minutes at 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.849
 room temperature 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.120
 then preheated to 40 a in 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.010
 ten minutes and final drying 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.859
 at sixty seven 200 degrees current 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.859
 o'clock 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.729
 as near confronts 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.060
 scratch and is very elastic 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.709
 so big risks are difficult to retire 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.879
 surface 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.260
 so use finely for polishing 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.479
 abrasive paste 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.829
 i.e. landmark remove water resistant 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.940
 two thousand grit paper 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.220
 korean posed 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.690
 two thousandth paper 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.690
 300 thousandth 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.449
 risks left by grit paper 3 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.899

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:08.779
 pasta 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.309
 the conclusion is polished all ultra fine 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.309
 pasta 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.689
 make sure to abrasive fasting 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.159
 low heat lacquer 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.159
 polishers 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.039
 for polishing the transition point use 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.099
 plans with a gradual decrease 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.089
 grit abrasive pass from 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.799
 shallow shallow shallow use none
