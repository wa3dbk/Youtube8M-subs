00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 and hello again to all of Voronezh friends 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.969
 means 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.390
 played my buckwheat braga along with 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:21.600
 member malt 11 days after 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 I put it on the balcony and now somewhere else 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.090
 for about six days she stood by me 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 balcony 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.730
 on the balcony until the snail is cool under 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:41.390
 the accent was covered well and it is clear that she 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 divided from above can be seen here to here 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 liquid part 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 and the lower one is already so thick 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:00.390
 a deposit of malt from buckwheat means I will 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.239
 now the whole thing is not to merge here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 I know that there is cold I will not freeze just 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 frost is strong and when i 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
 peeks at what's on top of the ice 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 swam now kind of warmed up just 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.180
 I put another such icon on 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.850
 that case there will be ice 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.380
 to not get there in general let's 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 let's see what's inside now 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 going on and everything inside looks like 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.290
 Something like this is not clear as shorter 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.290
 it all looks like a clock scooped up 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:56.429
 so to me and yes no way yes no 4 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 it was muddy a little bit okay in general 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:04.020
 spilling this thing into a cube and I will 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.289
 distill and so here it is that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.830
 I have a fermentation tank 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:15.019
 here it is straight at all and so much I 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.780
 poured into the cube is now left 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.450
 a little less than 30 meters well, just another 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.860
 one stage and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.500
 but Iâ€™ll probably be this one 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.769
 distill with your house right there 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.860
 quite thick and thick so left 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.680
 it's on the stove and on the maximum overclocking and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.049
 so put yakub on the plate and 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.030
 maximum heating 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.510
 it's time to try for a brother in 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.269
 we got here, though actually Braga 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.799
 on enzymes and on any koji not 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 recommends trying but I absolutely 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:03:01.850
 slightly try the edges of the crap 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.850
 oh tree stick 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.670
 due to somehow taste is not very 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:17.160
 something sour gives away 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:20.000
 damn she did not register so okay cho 60 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.849
 liters of such beautiful armor and 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.180
 throw away okay distill hour 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.340
 I will look through this business but 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.880
 honestly clear initial 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.769
 the result does not please me so the process 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.530
 I went here such a line flows but 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.919
 there was already so much in this jar 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.940
 about the head and there are so many more 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.620
 chose not heads, and so that shorter than 1 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.239
 flowed out 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.850
 it is clear that everything was mixed up or 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.470
 heads everything else but the smell was 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.810
 Of course fathers tone concrete right I 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.169
 as much surprised as still would not book until 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.500
 kick a hole already on the second fractional stink 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:10.859
 thoroughly what does the hour mean 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.949
 how much is and then show how much 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:18.000
 this all turned out so friends here 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:20.370
 It looks like an intermediate result here 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.090
 I got one jar fortress 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.310
 65 degrees there are three hydrants one more 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.160
 a jar but here it didnâ€™t measure to what 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.070
 and therefore the arrows are now almost 40 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.310
 degrees fortress is not approximately 39 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.310
 degrees 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.460
 judging by the fortress, you can still drive 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.560
 and drive 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.310
 that is, you can squeeze that alcohol end 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.960
 there is just some kind of new 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.139
 unreal I can not stand it anymore 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.850
 think so here's these koji stinks 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.760
 last time and when the distilled code 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.940
 too, but 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.960
 Well in my opinion is not so much do not stink 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.850
 maybe I have already forgotten in general 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.800
 stopping epaulet stop here 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.280
 these forty degrees 2 i was right there for 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.740
 Can and to diary such here in principle 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.970
 alcohol yield is pretty good 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.150
 it turns out actually a body group 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.790
 rare until something is difficult to say well, 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.350
 stinks very much 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.990
 Means what I have left with enzymes 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.530
 there will still be just one bag for porridge 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.290
 thick today I really will not overtake 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:37.000
 how can we allocate time and overtake it 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:42.730
 and then there will be a second fractional distillation 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.190
 so wait be 2 / instillation 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.040
 let's see what happens out of this thing but 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.730
 yet honestly honestly not yet 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.850
 let's see what happens next 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.850
 subscribe to the channel for new meetings 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.850
 until
