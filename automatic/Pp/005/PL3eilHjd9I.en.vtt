have been able to create an item and
rename<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.060> use<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> player<00:00:30.539> interact

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
rename it and then use a player interact

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650 
rename it and then use a player interact
event<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.800> check<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.399> being<00:00:32.790> used<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
event to check if it's being used and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.350 
event to check if it's being used and
then<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.559> could<00:00:34.800> also<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.460> texture<00:00:36.180> pack

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
then you could also have a texture pack

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.819 
then you could also have a texture pack
as<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> server<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.680> other

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
as this where on a server or other

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.190 
as this where on a server or other
resource<00:00:38.399> pack<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.210> were<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.600> server<00:00:39.870> or

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
resource pack this were on a server or

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
resource pack this were on a server or
locally<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> could<00:00:41.550> use<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
locally and then you could use that to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
block and can actually be used for

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.270 
block and can actually be used for
building<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.600> again<00:01:30.720> please<00:01:31.680> note<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.009> this

actual image I've gone ahead and created
an<00:01:47.189> image<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:49.350> 16<00:01:50.070> pixels<00:01:50.610> by<00:01:50.820> 16

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
an image right here it's 16 pixels by 16

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
an image right here it's 16 pixels by 16
pixels<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.950> basically<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.610> like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
pixels and then it's basically just like

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.319 
pixels and then it's basically just like
a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.119> blue<00:01:55.729> background<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:57.180> it

to want to take the custom items API
that<00:02:29.280> I've<00:02:29.400> made<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.850> make<00:02:30.060> sure<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.330> in

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that I've made and make sure it's in

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.330 
that I've made and make sure it's in
your<00:02:30.540> build<00:02:30.780> path<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.740> actually<00:02:31.920> use

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
your build path so you can actually use

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.840 
your build path so you can actually use
it<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:34.590> we're<00:02:34.710> gonna<00:02:34.770> go<00:02:34.980> ahead<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> do

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
it so what we're gonna go ahead and do

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.990 
it so what we're gonna go ahead and do
is<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> player<00:02:37.080> joins<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.010> server<00:02:38.310> we're

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
is when a player joins the server we're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.950 
is when a player joins the server we're
going<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.420> give<00:02:39.720> them<00:02:39.960> one<00:02:40.350> block<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:41.270> 29mm<00:02:42.330> so

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
going to give them one block of 29mm so

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.240 
going to give them one block of 29mm so
the<00:02:43.050> way<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.470> going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.740> do<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.070> is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the way that you're going to do this is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.170 
the way that you're going to do this is
you're<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.640> write<00:02:45.020> custom<00:02:46.020> item<00:02:47.180> item

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you're going to write custom item item

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.860 
you're going to write custom item item
is<00:02:48.690> equal<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.320> new<00:02:49.670> custom<00:02:50.670> item<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.690> first

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
is equal to new custom item the first

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.900 
is equal to new custom item the first
and<00:02:52.200> now<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.500> takes<00:02:52.740> three<00:02:53.100> parameters<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and now this takes three parameters the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.700 
and now this takes three parameters the
first<00:02:53.940> parameter<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.690> give<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.590> can

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
first parameter you give it and you can

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.890 
first parameter you give it and you can
go<00:02:55.830> ahead<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:55.980> import<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.640> mean<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.540> post

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
go ahead and import it mean that post

just<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.580> decoration<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.420> then<00:03:33.840> an<00:03:33.960> item<00:03:34.260> is

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
something that can't be placed like

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.880 
something that can't be placed like
armor<00:03:36.150> or<00:03:36.390> tools<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.350> would<00:03:37.620> just

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
armor or tools that you would just

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.850 
armor or tools that you would just
actually<00:03:38.490> use<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.290> gonna<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> type

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
actually use so it's gonna be the type

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.650 
actually use so it's gonna be the type
block<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.460> then<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.730> need<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.910> actually<00:03:42.390> pass

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
block and then you need to actually pass

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.980 
block and then you need to actually pass
it<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.990> image<00:03:43.320> now<00:03:43.770> for<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:44.490> yeah<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.780> pass

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
it the image now for now yeah you pass

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.230 
it the image now for now yeah you pass
it<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.890> side<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.490> it<00:03:47.610> automatically

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
it the one side and it automatically

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.760 
it the one side and it automatically
wraps<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.110> all<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> sides

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
wraps that for all of the sides

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.830 
wraps that for all of the sides
eventually<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.580> could<00:03:50.700> add<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.150> where<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:51.420> pass

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
eventually I could add it where you pass

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.330 
eventually I could add it where you pass
it<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.110> know<00:03:52.350> different<00:03:52.740> images<00:03:53.010> for

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
it you know different images for

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.040 
it you know different images for
different<00:03:53.370> sides<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.570> want<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.840> go<00:03:54.930> ahead

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
different sides but you want to go ahead

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.930 
different sides but you want to go ahead

have the image and you want it to be 16
pixels<00:04:16.320> by<00:04:16.799> 16<00:04:17.370> pixels<00:04:17.850> if<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.540> take<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> look

there<00:04:22.290> are<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.440> couple<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:23.030> methods<00:04:24.030> just<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
there are a couple of methods just the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.840 
there are a couple of methods just the
getters<00:04:25.290> for<00:04:25.320> whatever<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.100> pass<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.669> know

getters for whatever you pass you know

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.430 
getters for whatever you pass you know
the<00:04:26.910> image<00:04:27.180> which<00:04:27.330> returns<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> path<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.350> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
the image which returns the path to the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800 
the image which returns the path to the
image<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:29.490> name<00:04:29.730> or<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.450> know<00:04:30.540> whatever

image the name or you know whatever
image<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.110> give<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.470> there<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.040> name<00:04:32.280> and

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
image you give it there the name and

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.610 
image you give it there the name and
then<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.030> item<00:04:33.360> type<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.110> then<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.380> other

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
then the item type and then the other

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.890 
then the item type and then the other
method<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.250> two<00:04:35.700> items<00:04:36.060> stack<00:04:36.330> which<00:04:36.540> returns

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
method is two items stack which returns

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.260 
method is two items stack which returns
an<00:04:37.050> item<00:04:37.320> stack<00:04:37.590> representation<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:38.940> item

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
an item stack representation of the item

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.360 
an item stack representation of the item
so<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.840> course<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.260> would<00:04:40.410> want<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.710> use<00:04:40.890> that

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
so of course you would want to use that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.710 
so of course you would want to use that
when<00:04:41.760> doing<00:04:41.970> something<00:04:42.210> with<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.510> players

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
when doing something with the players

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.190 
when doing something with the players
inventory<00:04:43.230> or<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.820> know<00:04:44.940> checking<00:04:45.450> for<00:04:45.990> you

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
inventory or you know checking for you

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.780 
inventory or you know checking for you
know<00:04:46.380> type<00:04:46.680> or<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.130> know<00:04:47.220> whatever<00:04:47.400> so<00:04:47.730> you

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
know type or you know whatever so you

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.220 
know type or you know whatever so you
would<00:04:47.910> want<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.120> use<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.450> Q<00:04:48.720> item<00:04:48.960> stack

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
would want to use that Q item stack

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.110 
would want to use that Q item stack
method<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.040> we're<00:04:50.130> going<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> say<00:04:50.430> II<00:04:50.640> get

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
method so we're going to say II get

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.760 
method so we're going to say II get

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
item dot - item stack and then since

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.550 
item dot - item stack and then since
that<00:05:01.890> returns<00:05:02.370> type<00:05:02.850> item<00:05:03.300> stack<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:04.290> should

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
that returns type item stack that should

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.190 
that returns type item stack that should
work<00:05:04.770> out<00:05:04.980> just<00:05:05.010> fine<00:05:05.840> everything<00:05:06.840> else<00:05:06.990> looks

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
work out just fine everything else looks

good the event is being registered we

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.790 
good the event is being registered we
have<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.480> image<00:05:09.750> in<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> correct<00:05:10.170> place<00:05:10.530> and
