that we're gonna do here is inch and a
half<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:47.180> sleeper's<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.390> again<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.780> all

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
half the sleeper's here again are all

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.150 
half the sleeper's here again are all
inch<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> half<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.010> gonna

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
inch and a half so we're just gonna

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
inch and a half so we're just gonna
match<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.700> top<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> sleepers<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.559> can

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
match the top of the sleepers and we can

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
match the top of the sleepers and we can
pour<00:00:53.039> deeper<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.910> need<00:00:54.690> be

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
pour deeper if need be

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410 
pour deeper if need be
now<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> heating<00:00:55.980> tubes<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.550> expand<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
now the heating tubes will expand and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
now the heating tubes will expand and
contract<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.379> heat<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.100> cool<00:00:59.309> off

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
contract as they heat up and cool off

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
contract as they heat up and cool off

a<00:01:33.450> stone<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.590> also<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> help

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
a stone but it's also going to help

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
a stone but it's also going to help
muffle<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> noise<00:01:35.850> between<00:01:36.240> floors<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.110> help

muffle the noise between floors and help

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
muffle the noise between floors and help
keep<00:01:38.009> fire<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.520> spreading<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.360> non

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
keep fire from spreading as it is non

this<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.720> an<00:01:42.810> eighth<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.140> an<00:01:43.229> inch<00:01:43.320> per<00:01:43.710> day<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
this as an eighth of an inch per day to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
this as an eighth of an inch per day to
cure<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.329> an<00:01:45.420> inch<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
cure out so here we're an inch and a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.039 
cure out so here we're an inch and a
half<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.470> you're<00:01:46.619> gonna<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.000> 14<00:01:48.780> days

half so you're gonna be you know 14 days
the<00:01:49.829> sleepers<00:01:50.340> give<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> guys<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.240> good

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the sleepers give the guys a pretty good

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
the sleepers give the guys a pretty good
idea<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.259> high<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.740> want<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> pour<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
idea of how high they want the pour to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.420 
idea of how high they want the pour to
end<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.619> pours<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
end up and so that's how I can pours it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.889 
end up and so that's how I can pours it
and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:56.939> Marc<00:01:57.149> comes<00:01:57.360> along<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.869> behind

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and then Marc comes along right behind

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.289 
and then Marc comes along right behind
and<00:01:58.500> fine-tunes<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.939> these<00:02:00.090> knobby

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and fine-tunes it with these knobby

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
and fine-tunes it with these knobby
bottom<00:02:00.689> shoes<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> he's<00:02:01.320> wearing<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.950> can

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
bottom shoes that he's wearing he can

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
bottom shoes that he's wearing he can
glide<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.610> along<00:02:02.880> without<00:02:03.450> stirring<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
glide right along without stirring it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.630 
glide right along without stirring it
all<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.159> keep<00:02:05.189> me<00:02:05.460> from

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
all up that's just to keep me from

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280 
all up that's just to keep me from
leaving<00:02:05.909> footprints<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> floor<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.079> I'm

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
leaving footprints on the floor as I'm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100 
leaving footprints on the floor as I'm
floating<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.149> use<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> piece<00:02:10.080> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
floating it and then I use a piece of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.080 
floating it and then I use a piece of
red<00:02:10.410> wood<00:02:10.590> cut

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.460 
one six footer and one three footer and
we<00:02:13.550> just<00:02:13.700> put<00:02:14.120> some<00:02:14.270> nails<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.750> some<00:02:15.050> closet

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
we just put some nails and some closet

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.530 
we just put some nails and some closet
poll<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.100> some<00:02:16.130> room<00:02:16.730> braces<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.360> it

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
poll to it with some room braces on it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.840 
poll to it with some room braces on it
that's<00:02:18.080> about<00:02:18.290> all<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.500> used<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.160> finishing<00:02:19.700> is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
that's about all I used the finishing is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.699 
that's about all I used the finishing is
in<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> very<00:02:20.390> best<00:02:20.660> of<00:02:20.840> hands<00:02:21.110> Mark's<00:02:21.560> been

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
in the very best of hands Mark's been

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.650 
in the very best of hands Mark's been
doing<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.160> basically<00:02:22.730> since<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> product

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
doing this basically since the product

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.000 
doing this basically since the product
was<00:02:23.810> first<00:02:24.050> introduced

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
was first introduced

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.860 
was first introduced
so<00:02:25.220> he's<00:02:25.459> been<00:02:25.610> at<00:02:25.819> it<00:02:26.000> longer<00:02:26.270> than<00:02:26.480> anyone

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
so he's been at it longer than anyone

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.720 
so he's been at it longer than anyone
else<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> whole<00:02:27.709> country<00:02:27.890> doesn't

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
necessarily have to be that smooth

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.170 
necessarily have to be that smooth
finish<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.739> just<00:02:30.860> try<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.310> make<00:02:31.640> sure<00:02:31.670> it's<00:02:32.000> nice

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
finish I just try to make sure it's nice

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.360 
finish I just try to make sure it's nice

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
it you can kind of see if we've achieved

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.500
