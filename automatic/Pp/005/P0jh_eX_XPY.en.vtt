00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 the Pope speaks I was beauty who speaks 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 venezuela gives you more here my 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.139
 first video on v power gt r channel 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 this first gameplay me is always the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.770
 better this first video commented on 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 team and was caught by imes brian 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.359
 you probably already know a channel 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.730
 an excellent channel including a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.230
 excellent player and play on the pc and together 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 This video of course I will comment a little 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.600
 on the playstation 3 xbox the pt and the pc 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.260
 neon comparing to each other as to lobbies 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.809
 and everything else 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.050
 starting with the pc that was included 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 Tripod type on the last round point is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 I'll get it right on the map as you already 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 saw the car and this gameplay was very 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.550
 Fuck it was very incredible, even she was. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 take the pc that curiosity is incredible 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.719
 here because you do not need on pc 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 you do not see so many people I designed 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 Paulo you do not see much company 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.440
 you see another and even more 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 a type I never made very pretty 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 Finally one people have trouble 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 find lobby because there are not many 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.340
 players or you have an idea is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.720
 do not think the ps3 on average currently have 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 300 thousand and 400 thousand né 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.939
 will depend a lot on the time of day and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 of ovary factors therein that involve clear 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.049
 that players play 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 I did not think you said that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.320
 I have received that some friends have about 30 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.329
 40 50 have a higher peak has another 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.939
 that falls at dawn so it should stay 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.820
 Welcome to this room by the number of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.520
 players playing the stores usually have 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 players who vary a lot you can not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.009
 set for example which country playoff 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.229
 are better in case they are those of pcs 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.270
 are from playstation 3 or xbox 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.340
 This is something I find very difficult to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.180
 if I talk but still I say no 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.560
 need 3 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.140
 I think I have more because there are more people. 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.969
 playing than the xbox playstation 3 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.969
 depending on the day 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.299
 You have an average of 300 thousand playing xbox. 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.360
 a smaller number is a crime because it was the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.660
 live pay then this contributes 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.030
 sure that the live has less 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.360
 people as a consequence have less 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.300
 players and 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.730
 - the game place is then a point 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.530
 highlight of who plays in the xbox but 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.660
 that is not why the player does not find 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.560
 room is the difference between price 3 xbox 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.650
 not so real so relevant as that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.810
 something that really changes is the system of 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.000
 find the death but it is really something 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.820
 that you will depend a lot on how I 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.920
 I had mentioned here the time of day and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.800
 of several other things 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.690
 finally this in play beach game 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.550
 probably you as I had already spoken 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.610
 here you sure know the channel 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.620
 him and knows him as a player is difficult. 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 find you find a small pc team 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.620
 even more this law that do intend 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.630
 have by core 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.430
 you usually find some teams 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.290
 there, gringas 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.620
 I have not seen many people of weight and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.410
 lately 80% 90 of what I see of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.950
 nuclear and low stopper video is the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.650
 most console is neither a nor 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.750
 so the guy who plays a little on the pc 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.330
 I say people who play São Paulo are 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.510
 stuck even on the pc and this I think 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.459
 very rarely the first channels that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.769
 was known in Brazil were from 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:33.820
 brazilians and brazilians 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:36.510
 Obviously they played there for some time. 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.630
 there are only other options is 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.730
 I believe I give one every 10 10 pc 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:50.320
 I do not think even this is very cool 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:52.780
 we have three enough player you 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.200
 It's very easy, I say that because 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.420
 You play on the PS3 and of course I already got javi 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 sticks game place very good always the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.810
 section 3 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.180
 I've been researching on already looked 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.950
 job vacancies also xbox 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.260
 compare one against I think a lot 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.170
 difficult thing that you would take too long 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.860
 I do not even know if it's comparable, it's because 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.359
 you have good players there in each one 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.959
 each platform is not 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.120
 and you make that differentiation there very 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.060
 Difficult for example, I already called me. 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.950
 very good in the process 13 that I lived there 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.960
 many teams also appeared in xbox 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.970
 it's hard to say what is best 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.790
 Difficult to say with the platform is 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.550
 you better find players run into noves 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.930
 best for the tops which is 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.320
 I think it's more than competitive. 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.480
 defined that the live yet is still 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.150
 coming back to the subject of little shade 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.190
 in this gameplay leave a comment too 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.480
 cool here for me to do I do not think so 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.300
 I can leave a comment in this comment 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.210
 that yes this gameplay was excellent and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.270
 mp3 and is the best I've seen so far 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.030
 it was that of a pc core is very 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.590
 beautiful in strong khar with great time ne 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.780
 I think there's not much to talk about the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.020
 next you realize why the bayern 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.420
 plays well on the PC and of course find it 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.880
 Bella must be very difficult imagine that 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.470
 Did you find the hardcore dominich or even 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.320
 even the action of the coaster should be 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.880
 hard even hardcore dominich a 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.470
 multi me a great work then of course 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.700
 as he had already spoken to go after his son 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.810
 will also depend very much on the 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:34.330
 day and other factors that involve time 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.230
 and some things like that and for me too 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.090
 really is to say that it supports sometimes 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.510
 can work even can help chub 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.890
 be 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.800
 I say it gets in the way because you go. 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.620
 look for it to search the room with 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.180
 stop and fall and that leaves you 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.400
 I did not even want to play a game 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.640
 really upset if you really 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.110
 get well stressed we want to play logo 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.330
 many times to play big 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.560
 games and gets 30 minutes to play the 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.630
 from 10 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.670
 it is very annoying right but when 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.650
 You want a bad love , you look good. 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.580
 stressed or wanted to call but his 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.400
 I do not play 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.500
 finally this influence in play my 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.380
 Congratulations there or Brian, no channel from him. 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.400
 will stay in the description at this excellent 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.680
 pc game an incredible core type with 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.150
 I do even more that the lack has samba that 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.940
 You have to have the ability to play. 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.380
 with it without the site fire me with the time 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.960
 I learned to play with her 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.000
 well but that is no longer the ps must 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.470
 complicate enough imagination and 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.530
 Difficulty that should be on the PC for us 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.430
 who plays on the console would take a pc and it was 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.620
 play there right? 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.030
 finally this fascinating job in this 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.040
 mentioned 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.020
 if you liked this virus that is clear 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.610
 what will my channel evaluate? 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.340
 refund if you will check the 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.110
 My work with children in videos is not 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.730
 that's it I will not stop here 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.510
 forget to delete this video and confirm 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.550
 the channel 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.550
 A hug and thanks
