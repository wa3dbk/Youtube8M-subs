this with the engine disassembled the
engine<00:00:32.349> was<00:00:32.710> disassembled<00:00:33.610> for<00:00:33.670> an<00:00:33.910> alleged

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
engine was disassembled for an alleged

engine was disassembled for an alleged
engine<00:00:34.930> noise<00:00:36.629> this<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:37.690> how<00:00:38.350> we<00:00:38.410> picked<00:00:38.890> it<00:00:39.010> up

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.209 

so<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.079> need<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.469> begin<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:45.980> looking<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so we need to begin with looking at the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
so we need to begin with looking at the
cylinder<00:00:47.670> head<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> inspecting<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> push

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cylinder head and inspecting the push

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
cylinder head and inspecting the push
rods<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.940> tap<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> ends<00:00:52.670> push<00:00:53.670> rod

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
rods to see if the tap it ends push rod

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
rods to see if the tap it ends push rod
ends<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:55.010> become<00:00:56.010> unsecured<00:00:56.989> which<00:00:57.989> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
ends have become unsecured which can

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
ends have become unsecured which can
make<00:00:58.470> noise<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.519> that's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.540> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
make noise if that's not it then we have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.549 
make noise if that's not it then we have
no<00:01:00.809> option<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> reassemble<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.220> engine

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
no option but to reassemble this engine

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.810 
no option but to reassemble this engine
and<00:01:05.390> check<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> oil<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.140> been<00:01:07.560> such<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> get

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and check the oil it's been such and get

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
and check the oil it's been such and get
it<00:01:08.909> started<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.420> see<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:09.990> find<00:01:10.200> for

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it started and see what we can find for

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.760 
it started and see what we can find for
noise

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.359 

you

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.399 

the<00:01:22.369> first<00:01:22.700> issue<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:26.409> horrendously

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the first issue we have is horrendously

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.039 
the first issue we have is horrendously
tight<00:01:30.009> intake<00:01:31.009> valve<00:01:31.340> clearance<00:01:32.049> these

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
tight intake valve clearance these

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:41.169 
tight intake valve clearance these
should<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.580> 15<00:01:35.890> millimeter<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:40.610> won't<00:01:40.880> take

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
should be 15 millimeter it won't take

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.440 
should be 15 millimeter it won't take
them<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.630> barely<00:01:41.960> takes<00:01:42.259> a<00:01:42.470> five

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.380 

exhausts<00:01:47.200> are<00:01:47.320> okay<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.100> all<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.880> fuck<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.270> up

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
exhausts are okay so all the fuck is up

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.330 
exhausts are okay so all the fuck is up
of<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> there's<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.619> ten<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.619> will<00:01:56.830> not<00:01:57.040> take<00:01:57.310> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
of that there's a ten it will not take a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.260 
of that there's a ten it will not take a
ten<00:01:59.520> its<00:02:00.520> arresting<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.369> this<00:02:03.550> would<00:02:03.790> release

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
ten its arresting so this would release

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.210 
ten its arresting so this would release
these<00:02:04.600> three<00:02:05.080> bolts<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:08.050> can<00:02:08.259> smell<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.770> burnt
