 Hey, people, youtube, beauty, be well. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.480
 Welcome to another video and I'm going today. 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.950
 show you how to make a 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 sound amplifier 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.009
 arceu em pt ce mp 4 cell phone using 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 pc sound boxes what I did was 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.210
 replace the original carton club 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 Sound is this from here I get a niche and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.470
 was 0 800 but unfortunately it came without 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 the club that connects on the fourth of 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 computer and I understand here in a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 shop specialized in equipment of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 sound but he does not come with these kids I 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 I had to be from them and the next step is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.480
 dismantle the main sound box that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.030
 The one with the power button turns off and the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 button next 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.100
 locate where the wire is connected 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 kindle that is the one that stays 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 connected on the sound card of the pc and with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 care and peel and in this model 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.360
 I found within this thread three children 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 two of different colors and one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 bare 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 then you need to peel the 2 x 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 and weld on one of the children of the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.270
 club that you made sodium cloaked 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 on the other end of the club is only 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.890
 ride the box again I'll pass the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.409
 wires through the same volume knob hole 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.409
 and the result is really cool 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.020
 Good guys, I hope you have.
