00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.918
 This is crazy, so I've been Titan for over 20 years, 

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.542
 and that I have not even made one with an inner mesh capsule, 

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:33.125
 so I'm so glad we did this last summer, which was very hot. 

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.375
 That last tent I tested, 

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.876
 and I think it's great when you can keep the mosquitoes and the rest of the gang at a distance. 

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.000
 For our European friends, this will be much more important detail and greater advantage, 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.542
 because with this network you protect yourself from the snake and some other nasty animals at the same time. 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.375
 There is a version of the Globetrotters tent for one and two men. 

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.167
 They work with the mosquito net, and the waterproof front, 

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.000
 where you can slice the panels to expose the net to the doors and windows. 

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.834
 He has another outside watertight wall and an extended porch. 

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:18.792
 If you are in a situation where your rain falls into your face, you can close the door by a patent closure, 

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.167
 so water does not enter the tent. 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.459
 At the far end of the tent is another patent apron, 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.542
 so you can open it as needed and open a mosquito net at the opening, 

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:38.667
 so that during the hot summer days and nights you have air flow in the tent. 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.834
 This is Titan in every sense of the word. 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.999
 It has that legendary Titan frame that is known for its strength. 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.417
 In fact, he has already saved some people lives. 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.209
 A mesh capsule was added to it. 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.999
 this summer was horribly hot, and I was just kidding with it 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.918
 so I did not cover the tent with the overwrap. 

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.292
 If the nights were damp or when rain was raining, it would only overwrap the overwrap. 

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:05.959
 Due to its double layer, there is no moisture condensation in the tent. 

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.459
 There is a groundsheet attached to the mosquito net. 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.999
 This facilitates quick stacking and lifting of the tent. 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.751
 However, besides him there is also a very strong base. 

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:25.459
 I would certainly recommend that you use it everywhere, because if the shore has rough stones, the strong foundation will protect you from drilling. 

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:31.667
 You saw them now. 

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:35.042
 Titan Globetrotter is available in sizes for one man and two men. 

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:38.167
 It's really a great tent, and I think the real fishermen in it really will enjoy it. 

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.375
 As I said, the summers have become very hot in our country, 

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.584
 then I can think of it as our European friends. 

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:45.000
 I hope they think I think of them now.
