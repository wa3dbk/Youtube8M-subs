 no more than one phone 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.300
 and you can read them between them 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 Quick 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.259
 the type of mobile phone of any 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.829
 again 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.070
 in conclusion however this 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.890
 an audio system above the rest 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.040

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.690
 also but this 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.690
 superiority 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.370

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.370

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.220
 so any kind of charger 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.220
 the important thing is that you have a future 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.020
 in which the active ones are called and no longer 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.470
 and it's outside noise and calls 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.470
 maxillary 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.159

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.390

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.920
 you can not control it is also here 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.200
 and good the sale and why 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.200
 by the way it has 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.880
 for any kind of 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.890
 everything is available in Spain 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.790
 the people who have 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.110
 search password 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.000
 you do not have to open the lid 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.660
 it's a way to save energy I liked it 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.660
 what thinking 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.159
 It is an explanation of the same as no phone 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.159
 from lg 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.080
 in general what we want 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.850
 from here 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.350
 this one here has only one machine 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.480
 open it places the phone 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.750
 and you can use it so much to load us already 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 the time 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.230
 to be able to put television channels 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.230
 or whatever you want is activated with 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.230
 important 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.580
 Y 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.580
 here 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.920
 in this case with the reason above not 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.070
 you can see there what you're going on and start 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.030
 to loads and directly 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:37.010
 it's a little more economical - it supports 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.970
 directly like this with devices that 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.970
 have incorporated 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.620
 the talkers 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.320
