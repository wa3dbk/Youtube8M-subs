00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
that's going to have a surprise when he

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.180 
that's going to have a surprise when he
gets<00:05:54.479> back<00:05:54.659> to<00:05:54.690> his<00:05:54.900> pitch<00:05:55.139> quieter<00:05:55.919> he<00:05:56.069> had

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
gets back to his pitch quieter he had

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.610 
gets back to his pitch quieter he had
one<00:05:56.430> taking<00:05:56.879> on<00:05:57.000> perhaps<00:05:57.330> Black<00:05:57.960> Stallion

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
driven by Mike botters or perhaps it

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.920

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
going to be a good one I said earlier

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.659 
going to be a good one I said earlier
black<00:06:09.990> say<00:06:10.259> it's<00:06:10.529> not<00:06:10.680> built<00:06:10.949> for<00:06:11.129> racing<00:06:11.250> and

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
he's going up against the national

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.409 
he's going up against the national
champion<00:06:13.620> right<00:06:13.800> now<00:06:14.009> okay<00:06:14.699> what<00:06:14.879> Roz<00:06:15.120> had<00:06:15.360> a

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
champion right now okay what Roz had a

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.040 
champion right now okay what Roz had a
little<00:06:15.599> bit<00:06:15.690> of<00:06:15.779> problems<00:06:16.110> with<00:06:16.229> attention

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
little bit of problems with attention

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.200 
little bit of problems with attention
sounds<00:06:17.379> real<00:06:17.530> good<00:06:17.949> he<00:06:18.190> does<00:06:18.400> take<00:06:18.639> a<00:06:18.699> whiz<00:06:19.000> but

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
sounds real good he does take a whiz but

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.550 
sounds real good he does take a whiz but
I<00:06:19.270> think<00:06:19.539> he's<00:06:19.629> got<00:06:19.810> a<00:06:19.840> little<00:06:19.960> problem<00:06:20.110> Stan

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
I think he's got a little problem Stan

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.649 
I think he's got a little problem Stan
he<00:06:21.129> certainly<00:06:21.340> did<00:06:21.639> let<00:06:21.849> us<00:06:22.000> sitting<00:06:22.509> and

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
he certainly did let us sitting and

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.200 
he certainly did let us sitting and
puttering<00:06:22.990> there<00:06:23.289> but<00:06:23.620> he<00:06:24.310> got<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:24.669> wind<00:06:24.879> it

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
puttering there but he got the wind it

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.909 
puttering there but he got the wind it
does<00:06:25.479> he<00:06:25.690> can<00:06:25.870> see<00:06:26.050> here<00:06:26.259> he<00:06:26.409> doesn't<00:06:26.620> really

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
does he can see here he doesn't really

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.439 
does he can see here he doesn't really
clear<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.250> whole<00:06:27.490> lot<00:06:27.639> of<00:06:27.669> cars<00:06:27.970> and<00:06:28.180> he's<00:06:28.270> not

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
clear a whole lot of cars and he's not

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.119 
clear a whole lot of cars and he's not
getting<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.720> lot<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.870> speed<00:06:29.229> up<00:06:29.470> and<00:06:29.830> I<00:06:29.889> think

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
getting a lot of speed up and I think

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.200 
getting a lot of speed up and I think
he's<00:06:30.250> got<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.430> little<00:06:30.550> bit<00:06:30.699> of<00:06:30.759> problems<00:06:31.090> with

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
he's got a little bit of problems with

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.490 
he's got a little bit of problems with
his<00:06:31.300> carburetors<00:06:31.900> and<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.139> think<00:06:32.349> we'll<00:06:32.440> have

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
his carburetors and I think we'll have

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.689 
his carburetors and I think we'll have
to<00:06:32.590> see<00:06:32.830> what<00:06:32.979> happens<00:06:33.280> here<00:06:33.370> in<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.520> next

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
to see what happens here in the next

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.700 
to see what happens here in the next
round<00:06:33.879> all<00:06:34.150> right<00:06:34.300> let's<00:06:34.479> go<00:06:34.629> down<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.810> my<00:06:35.050> gun

round all right let's go down to my gun

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.770 
round all right let's go down to my gun
rod<00:06:36.129> another<00:06:36.550> win<00:06:36.879> but<00:06:37.210> I'm<00:06:37.330> still<00:06:37.599> hearing
