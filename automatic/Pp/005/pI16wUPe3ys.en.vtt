take that as many as out but it

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.870 
take that as many as out but it
will<00:04:54.570> be<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.870> inhibitor<00:04:55.490> will<00:04:55.870> hold

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.220 
will be the inhibitor will hold

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.700 
will be the inhibitor will hold
two<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.580> night

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.100 
two for the night

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.790 
two for the night
yeah<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.500> this<00:04:58.010> its<00:04:58.310> risks<00:04:58.790> this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.110 
yeah this this its risks this

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.010 
yeah this this its risks this
too<00:04:59.260> sick<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.010> over

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.240 
too sick is that the over

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.660 
too sick is that the over
parking<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.730> sport<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.660> does

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.050 
parking the sport but it does

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.560
