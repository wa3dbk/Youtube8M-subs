00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
like to get my glue on there on the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.090 
like to get my glue on there on the
cross<00:01:08.220> bracing<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> start<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
cross bracing and start with that and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
cross bracing and start with that and
it's<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.430> best<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> take<00:01:12.540> these

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it's really best if you can take these

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
it's really best if you can take these
down<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.570> words

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
down right where you want in other words

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
down right where you want in other words
get<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.439> spacing<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> same<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> each

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
get this the spacing the same on each

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
get this the spacing the same on each
end<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.810> ahead<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.020> take<00:01:19.290> those

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
end and then go ahead and take those

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.399 
end and then go ahead and take those
down<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:21.509> helps<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.020> keep<00:01:22.229> them

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
down on there that helps to keep them

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
down on there that helps to keep them
from<00:01:22.619> moving<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.090> has<00:01:24.299> glue<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
from moving just this all has glue on it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
from moving just this all has glue on it
of<00:01:25.049> course<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.670> doesn't<00:01:27.030> rip<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.270> right

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
of course but it doesn't rip it right

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.760 
of course but it doesn't rip it right
now<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> put<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> down

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now because I'm going to put it down

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
now because I'm going to put it down

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
already glued the bracing on so you

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
already glued the bracing on so you
don't<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> necessarily<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.030> four<00:01:45.450> of

one or two wants to jump out so you'll

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.890 
one or two wants to jump out so you'll
brace<00:02:58.890> all<00:02:59.130> those<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.579> there<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.849> usually<00:03:00.450> put

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
brace all those up there I usually put

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.559 
brace all those up there I usually put
three<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.709> each<00:03:01.890> side<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.459> cross<00:03:03.000> bracing

this is just sample of what we're pal we

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.000 
this is just sample of what we're pal we
brace<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.329> so<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> want<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.470> make<00:03:10.590> sure<00:03:10.799> that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
brace it so you want to make sure that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.800 
brace it so you want to make sure that
you're<00:03:11.220> bracing<00:03:11.430> stays<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.269> lines<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
you're bracing stays on the lines and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.490 
you're bracing stays on the lines and
when<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:14.420> brace<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.630> ends<00:03:15.989> make<00:03:16.139> sure<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
when you brace the ends make sure the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.410 
when you brace the ends make sure the
ends<00:03:16.769> are<00:03:16.859> down<00:03:17.069> good<00:03:19.489> this<00:03:20.489> rods<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.209> little

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
ends are down good this rods a little

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.699 
ends are down good this rods a little
bit<00:03:21.540> long<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:22.049> got<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> make<00:03:22.319> sure<00:03:22.530> the

bit long so you got to make sure the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.390 
bit long so you got to make sure the
length<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:23.100> these<00:03:23.190> rods<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:25.200> exactly<00:03:25.829> right<00:03:26.130> so

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
length of these rods is exactly right so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.420 
length of these rods is exactly right so
they<00:03:26.639> have<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.910> proper<00:03:27.269> tension<00:03:28.370> okay<00:03:29.370> so
