see a lot of them they just pour it over
the<00:03:15.090> heads<00:03:15.470> didn't<00:03:16.470> actually<00:03:16.620> drink<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
the heads didn't actually drink it you

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729 
the heads didn't actually drink it you
take<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:18.110> obviously<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.320> can't<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.709> that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
take it on obviously I can't do that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.130

with<00:03:20.160> my<00:03:20.190> hairstyle<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.870> end<00:03:22.049> up

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140

drenching whatever machine on one but

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
drenching whatever machine on one but
suppose<00:03:25.320> that's<00:03:25.530> one<00:03:25.709> benefit<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.160> having

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
suppose that's one benefit of having

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.860 
suppose that's one benefit of having
this<00:03:26.580> hairstyle<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.750> to
