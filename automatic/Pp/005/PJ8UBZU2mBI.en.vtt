they keep it under control there's a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.260

on the screen at any given time but it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.220

this game the game basically points out

this game the game basically points out
each<00:03:02.630> little<00:03:03.320> area<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.280> need<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.640> go<00:03:04.820> to

each little area that you need to go to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.259

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
and how to go ahead and do it for

and how to go ahead and do it for
example<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.900> little<00:03:09.440> arrow<00:03:09.620> will<00:03:09.920> point<00:03:10.160> up<00:03:10.400> if

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
example a little arrow will point up if

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.280 
example a little arrow will point up if
you<00:03:10.640> pick<00:03:10.850> up<00:03:11.000> an<00:03:11.150> item<00:03:11.239> that's<00:03:11.540> required<00:03:11.900> to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.650 
move on to the next part of the level
and<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:16.430> it'll<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.700> ahead<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.300> point<00:03:17.510> you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
and then it'll go ahead and point you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.720 
and then it'll go ahead and point you
exactly<00:03:17.989> where<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.230> need<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.920> if

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
exactly where you need to go and if

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.340 
exactly where you need to go and if
there's<00:03:19.940> any<00:03:20.120> obstacles<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.930> way<00:03:20.959> it'll

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
there's any obstacles in the way it'll

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.920 
there's any obstacles in the way it'll
actually<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:22.280> little<00:03:22.610> icons<00:03:23.060> telling<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
actually have little icons telling you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually have little icons telling you
which<00:03:24.260> type<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.680> character<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.250> need<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.850> get

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
which type of character you need to get

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.410 
which type of character you need to get
past<00:03:26.300> those<00:03:26.540> obstacles<00:03:27.760> for<00:03:28.760> example<00:03:29.180> if

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
past those obstacles for example if

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.000 
past those obstacles for example if
there's<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.690> barrel<00:03:30.080> that<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.560> need<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.830> blow

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
there's a barrel that you need to blow

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.330 
there's a barrel that you need to blow
up<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.940> move<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:33.650> game<00:03:33.800> will<00:03:34.010> highlight

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
up to move on the game will highlight

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.449 
up to move on the game will highlight
the<00:03:34.400> barrel<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.880> show<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.209> little<00:03:35.360> torch<00:03:35.690> icon

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
the barrel and show a little torch icon

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.710 
the barrel and show a little torch icon
so<00:03:37.459> there's<00:03:37.640> no<00:03:37.760> thinking<00:03:38.150> involved<00:03:38.239> there's

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
so there's no thinking involved there's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.270 
so there's no thinking involved there's
no<00:03:38.930> need<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.260> go<00:03:39.590> ahead<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.920> try<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.130> figure

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
no need to go ahead and try and figure

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.710 
no need to go ahead and try and figure
out<00:03:40.430> how<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.700> move<00:03:40.970> on<00:03:41.090> from<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.480> situation

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
out how to move on from this situation

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.840 
out how to move on from this situation
on<00:03:42.140> your<00:03:42.170> own<00:03:42.470> although<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.459> might<00:03:43.580> seem

overall<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.380> kind<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.739> breaks<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.160> game<00:04:07.340> for
