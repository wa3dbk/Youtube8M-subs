00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
work over the last year also I've been

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.920 
work over the last year also I've been
collecting<00:01:28.979> things<00:01:29.550> for<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.970> buying<00:01:30.330> little

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
collecting things for this buying little

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
collecting things for this buying little
parts<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.520> try<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.090> better

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
parts at a time to try to make it better

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
parts at a time to try to make it better
so<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> came<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.080> gearing<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.830> right

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so I came up to gearing in this right

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.480 
so I came up to gearing in this right
now<00:01:35.399> I'm<00:01:35.610> running<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.409> 9<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.770> spin<00:01:38.159> Yin<00:01:38.369> or

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
now I'm running like a 9 to spin Yin or

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
now I'm running like a 9 to spin Yin or
something<00:01:38.759> like<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.290> on<00:01:40.290> Flores<00:01:40.770> cell<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
something like that on Flores cell it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.330 
something like that on Flores cell it
wasn't<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.610> super<00:01:42.030> fast<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.570> anything<00:01:42.660> I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
wasn't like super fast or anything I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
wasn't like super fast or anything I
wasn't<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.580> testing<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.539> for<00:01:45.660> speed<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.200> was

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
wasn't really testing it for speed I was

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.719 
wasn't really testing it for speed I was
just<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.280> hold<00:01:47.490> up

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
just kind of see if it would hold up

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.389 
just kind of see if it would hold up
with<00:01:47.940> what<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.179> had<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.679> gearing<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
with what I had and up to gearing in it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.359 
with what I had and up to gearing in it
I'd<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> stuff<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.170> make<00:01:53.160> it

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
I'd have to do a lot of stuff to make it

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:06.169 
I'd have to do a lot of stuff to make it
survive<00:01:54.470> so<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.560> no<00:02:01.710> lamp<00:02:01.979> IP<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:05.220> for<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
survive so so good no lamp IP so for the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.630 
survive so so good no lamp IP so for the
Traxxas<00:02:07.080> Slash<00:02:07.110> rally<00:02:08.300> stampede<00:02:09.300> whatever

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.900 

I'm<00:02:14.640> gonna<00:02:14.820> hex<00:02:15.150> adapters<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.549> it's<00:02:17.549> gonna<00:02:17.700> run

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I'm gonna hex adapters so it's gonna run

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.170 
I'm gonna hex adapters so it's gonna run
a<00:02:17.940> 17<00:02:18.510> mil<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> these<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> end<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
a 17 mil so these just go on the end of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.470 
a 17 mil so these just go on the end of
it<00:02:21.299> here<00:02:22.670> which<00:02:25.700> we're<00:02:26.700> gonna<00:02:26.820> run<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.209> bad

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it here which we're gonna run these bad

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.100 
it here which we're gonna run these bad
boys<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.720> side<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> minute<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> these<00:02:33.900> are

wrap are you'd open them and see what

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.920 
wrap are you'd open them and see what
they<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:42.989> like<00:02:44.150> not<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.299> different<00:02:45.780> than

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
they look like not much different than

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.870 
they look like not much different than
the<00:02:46.079> other<00:02:46.110> ones<00:02:46.470> they<00:02:46.650> had<00:02:46.829> pretty<00:02:47.459> close<00:02:47.730> to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
the other ones they had pretty close to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.819 
the other ones they had pretty close to
being<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> same<00:02:48.290> I'm<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.410> sure<00:02:49.590> where<00:02:49.799> my

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
being the same I'm not sure where my

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.610 
being the same I'm not sure where my
other<00:02:50.100> one<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.730> compare<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.510> think<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.470> on

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
other one is to compare it think it's on

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.180 
other one is to compare it think it's on
my<00:02:53.180> axial<00:02:54.180> truck<00:02:54.480> right<00:02:54.750> now<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.049> my<00:02:55.200> sand<00:02:55.470> paws

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.700 

but<00:02:58.760> there's<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.330> hub<00:02:59.510> 17<00:03:00.350> mil<00:03:01.750> 2.8<00:03:02.750> oh<00:03:03.020> yeah

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
but there's the hub 17 mil 2.8 oh yeah

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.560 
but there's the hub 17 mil 2.8 oh yeah
so<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:04.550> are<00:03:04.700> pretty<00:03:04.880> exciting<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.450> they

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
so these are pretty exciting that they

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.280 
so these are pretty exciting that they
came<00:03:05.720> out<00:03:05.870> with<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.200> 17<00:03:06.740> mill<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.520> 2.8

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
came out with the 17 mill on 2.8

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.830 
came out with the 17 mill on 2.8
actually<00:03:09.580> was<00:03:10.580> gonna<00:03:10.730> Jimmy<00:03:11.090> rank<00:03:11.390> something

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
actually was gonna Jimmy rank something

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.570 
actually was gonna Jimmy rank something
with<00:03:12.020> some<00:03:12.170> cutting<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.740> tire<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.250> all<00:03:13.400> this
