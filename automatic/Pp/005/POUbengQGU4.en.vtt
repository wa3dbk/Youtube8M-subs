00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
three dots that Android has for the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.400 
three dots that Android has for the
settings<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.450> says<00:03:35.690> then<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.230> make<00:03:36.380> a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
settings and it says then I can make a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.030 
settings and it says then I can make a
cover<00:03:36.740> so<00:03:37.040> again<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.520> can<00:03:38.000> click<00:03:38.180> on<00:03:38.330> that<00:03:39.040> and

cover so again I can click on that and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.980 
cover so again I can click on that and
then<00:03:40.820> what<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.120> do<00:03:41.270> it's<00:03:41.420> going<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.600> just

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
then what I can do it's going to just

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.740 
then what I can do it's going to just
replace<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.380> with<00:03:42.710> one<00:03:43.070> icon<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:44.480> this

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
replace it with one icon in this

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.970 
replace it with one icon in this
instance<00:03:45.110> it's<00:03:45.200> going<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.380> be<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.620> on<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:45.890> you

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
instance it's going to be like on it you

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.770 
instance it's going to be like on it you
have<00:03:46.070> first<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.640> your<00:03:46.670> list<00:03:46.820> which<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.630> my<00:03:47.750> case

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
have first on your list which in my case

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.600 
have first on your list which in my case
is<00:03:47.990> messaging<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.860> again<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.400> going<00:03:49.550> to

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
is messaging and again it's going to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.400 
is messaging and again it's going to
work<00:03:49.760> very<00:03:50.060> similar<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.720> these<00:03:50.870> shutters<00:03:51.380> that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
work very similar to these shutters that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.870 
work very similar to these shutters that
we<00:03:51.650> had<00:03:51.830> here<00:03:52.040> which<00:03:52.220> I'm<00:03:52.400> put<00:03:52.550> up<00:03:52.610> a<00:03:52.640> widget

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
we had here which I'm put up a widget

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.150 
we had here which I'm put up a widget
and<00:03:53.240> now<00:03:53.570> if<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.780> slide<00:03:53.990> up<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:54.800> gonna<00:03:54.950> open

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
and now if you slide up it's gonna open

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.730 
and now if you slide up it's gonna open
the<00:03:55.460> folder<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.810> again<00:03:57.050> really<00:03:57.320> nice<00:03:57.500> way<00:03:57.710> to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
the folder so again really nice way to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.680 
the folder so again really nice way to
kind<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.100> have<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.310> very<00:03:58.370> minimal<00:03:58.880> design<00:03:59.330> but

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
kind of have a very minimal design but

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.390 
kind of have a very minimal design but
have<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.870> lot<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.140> apps<00:04:00.380> on<00:04:00.590> there<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:01.280> for

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
have a lot of apps on there so for

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.250 
have a lot of apps on there so for
inside<00:04:01.640> could<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:02.000> my<00:04:02.360> kind<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.720> 10<00:04:02.990> main

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
inside could have my kind of 10 main

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.200 
inside could have my kind of 10 main
apps<00:04:03.500> along<00:04:03.740> here<00:04:04.010> 15<00:04:04.460> if<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.730> could<00:04:04.850> include

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
apps along here 15 if you could include

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.580 
apps along here 15 if you could include
the<00:04:05.240> bottom<00:04:05.600> ones<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.410> could<00:04:06.530> have

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
the bottom ones but I could have

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.500 
the bottom ones but I could have
everything<00:04:07.100> what<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.490> I<00:04:07.610> have<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.090> my<00:04:08.240> phone

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
everything what if I have in my phone

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.540 
everything what if I have in my phone
but<00:04:09.020> you're<00:04:09.140> only<00:04:09.230> gonna<00:04:09.410> see<00:04:09.680> one<00:04:09.950> icon<00:04:10.430> which

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
but you're only gonna see one icon which

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.820 
but you're only gonna see one icon which
kind<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.850> represents<00:04:11.420> what<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.810> in<00:04:11.990> each<00:04:12.230> so

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
kind of represents what is in each so

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.350 
kind of represents what is in each so
again<00:04:13.100> with<00:04:13.250> messaging<00:04:13.760> for<00:04:13.880> instance<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.210> may

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
again with messaging for instance I may
