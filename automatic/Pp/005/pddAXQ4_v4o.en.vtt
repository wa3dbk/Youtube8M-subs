00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.010
 hello my name is vladimir jetta you 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.120
 See the test for the past 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.440
 a few days I managed 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.840
 borrow one of the top 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.550
 smartphones today and we have 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.230
 samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.630
 externally, the device resembles its 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.730
 predecessor with 3 compared to him with 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.950
 4 became less rounded but in my opinion 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.380
 This phone even went to benefit too 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.840
 very much like 3 pieces of soap on the sides 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.059
 smartphone frames the frame similar to 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.579
 metal however this plastic is really quite 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.280
 good quality back panel still 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.469
 glossy but now with the pattern on top we 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.160
 see the headphone jack and 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.440
 headsets 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.300
 near the peephole infrared port on 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.339
 left side volume control button 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.489
 on the right side is a button 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.480
 on-off at the bottom of micro usb 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.949
 connector and speaker with 4 located behind 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.019
 for its size the phone is not at all 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.300
 heavy 130 grams with such dimensions 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.699
 and such characteristics in my opinion 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.800
 the result is excellent in the hand is secure 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.320
 the gloss of the fingers just does not fall out 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.350
 naturally focuses 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 on display 5 inches 499 if to be 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.020
 exact 1920 to 1080 full hd points with 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.600
 this resolution pixel density 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.579
 makes 441 points on inch 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.229
 made by technology super amoled 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.329
 using pentile 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.280
 This is a special kind of pixel location. 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.469
 colors the display transmits well and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 unpleasant sensations picture does not cause 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.740
 unlike for example from busting with 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.549
 saturation which we could see 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.170
 vs3 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.719
 besides in the smartphone settings 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.520
 offers to choose several modes 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.500
 color renditions that did not like sometimes 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.780
 it seems that the picture is up 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.759
 the display flickers for example if you shake 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 smartphone starts to seem like that 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.170
 some interface elements 2 eggs 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.420
 but this is more likely my niggling than real 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.280
 lack of smartphones of course smartphone 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.710
 can not only show but also shoot 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 two cameras are responsible for this 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.369
 2 megapixel front and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.079
 13 megapixel main to rate 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.240
 I took some quality shots 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.369
 photos and shot a small video 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.009
 if we talk about my personal impressions 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.810
 I really liked the camera from 4 to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.820
 conditions of street photography at night and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.230
 daytime picture is good without 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.480
 Highlights and strong noises 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.380
 video quality is also sensor level 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 removes it in full hd resolution 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.200
 heart galaxy s4 is samsung processor 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 exynos 5410 consisting of as many as 8 cores 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.610
 operating at a frequency of 250 to 1600 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.390
 megahertz 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.870
 graphics are processed by power we are 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.700
 sgx544mp 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.830
 the ram of the smartphone 2 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.170
 gigabyte this device works on 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 android 4 2 2 operating system 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.520
 many collect it and have already received 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.410
 update 43 but specifically this device 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.390
 so far unfortunately content version 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.220
 ss which was supplied android here 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 unclean with branded samsungovskoy 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.970
 a shell that I personally do not like 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.220
 as any manufacturers attempt 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.200
 modify OSes with their 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.390
 decorations from interesting pieces 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.680
 control gestures and head smartphone 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.840
 can for example monitor the situation 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.120
 of your head when you look at the throne 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 and page and lower it down when you 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.920
 tilt your head and go back up 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.750
 when you raise it a little comfortable 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.670
 I personally don't have it, but this function 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.840
 for sure there are fans 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.120
 another interesting feature 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.760
 smartphone control with gestures 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.300
 for example, you can browse through photos in 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.010
 the gallery 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.290
 with the wave of the palm one more 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.450
 An interesting feature is that the phone 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.680
 understands the position of your finger even 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.870
 if you haven't touched yet 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.269
 they screen allows you to manage 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.070
 smartphone gloved besides 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.989
 necessary galaxy possesses 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.790
 infrared port by which 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.340
 You can for example control the TV 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.049
 to galaxy s4 earned as a remote 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.840
 samsung stocked apparatus 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.790
 preinstalled application 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.070
 besides him there are still notes planner 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.680
 translator and program is called upon and 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.820
 motivate you to do sports there 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.290
 even some semblance 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.060
 apple of sky series but about him even 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.130
 I don't want to speak voice control 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.680
 phone leaves much to be desired 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.630
 generally out of 4 produces ambiguous 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.040
 the impression of lack here seems to be 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.810
 there's nothing even have some 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.650
 overkill without which it was quite possible 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.989
 to manage 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.459
 it seems that the phone is not 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.630
 should help you decide yours 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.820
 everyday tasks 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.260
 and you have to spend your time to 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.900
 learn to use all those 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.400
 the possibilities that he has 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.060
 will cost all this around 20 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.130
 thousand rubles 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.340
 I think it's worth the money but I want 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.600
 to the designer and myself 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.250
 nick finally come up with something 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.440
 really interesting for my 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.210
 another flagship model to the stuffing 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.610
 no complaints but are we really 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.090
 need 8 cores anyway choice for 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.000
 you 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.199
 but before you buy, see the test 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.740
 subscribe to the channel and wait for your 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.740
