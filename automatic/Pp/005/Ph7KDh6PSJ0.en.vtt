00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.199
 that means the main feature of these 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 costumes difference from others is this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 its honest thickness that is many 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 wetsuit manufacturers write 7 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 millimeters in fact it happens 6 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.430

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.939
 bisi wetsuits gives it an honest 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.939
 the thickness of the neoprene here I for example keep 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.250
 BBC seller and take a wetsuit

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 not exactly another 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.189
 last longer though as costumes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 can sit down 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.560
 here is the second distinguishing feature 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 these costumes from all from many 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.880
 costume manufacturers and neck 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 is that inside the costume is made 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.229
 kneel glow metallic which 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.390
 It helps to wear a suit well with lighter without 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.850
 minimal use shampoo it is very 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:05.780
