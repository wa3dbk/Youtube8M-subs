00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
slide these for 10 minutes but it adds

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.429 
slide these for 10 minutes but it adds
up<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.579> 240<00:01:29.579> 6k<00:01:30.150> per<00:01:30.390> hour<00:01:30.570> using<00:01:30.869> abilities

up to 240 6k per hour using abilities

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.590 
up to 240 6k per hour using abilities
and<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.040> full<00:01:32.250> speed<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and just go in full speed and if you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
and just go in full speed and if you
don't<00:01:33.840> use<00:01:34.020> abilities<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:35.299> 200k<00:01:36.299> an

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
don't use abilities it's about 200k an

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.749 
don't use abilities it's about 200k an
hour<00:01:36.570> roughly<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.439> did<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.130> 10<00:01:38.369> minutes<00:01:38.610> without

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
hour roughly I did do 10 minutes without

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
hour roughly I did do 10 minutes without
abilities<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.479> well<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.930> didn't<00:01:40.170> record

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
abilities as well but I didn't record

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
abilities as well but I didn't record
them<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.280> 200k<00:01:41.909> an<00:01:42.030> hour

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
them but it is about 200k an hour

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.170 
them but it is about 200k an hour
without<00:01:42.270> abilities<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> almost<00:01:44.939> an

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
without abilities so this is almost an

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
without abilities so this is almost an

just because those weapons are very very

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.890 
just because those weapons are very very
efficient<00:02:44.750> at<00:02:44.870> killing<00:02:45.170> them<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.010> do<00:02:46.970> i<00:02:47.360> only

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
efficient at killing them so do i only

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.990 
efficient at killing them so do i only
use<00:02:48.110> basic<00:02:48.530> abilities<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.160> then<00:02:49.370> i<00:02:49.460> use<00:02:49.700> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.270 
abilities kill them very fast as well
you<00:03:03.050> can<00:03:03.080> kill<00:03:03.380> them<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.650> usually<00:03:04.070> two<00:03:04.250> or

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
you can kill them and usually two or

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280 
you can kill them and usually two or
three<00:03:04.610> hits<00:03:04.760> with<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.060> basic<00:03:05.390> ones<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.200> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
three hits with the basic ones so you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.840 
three hits with the basic ones so you
really<00:03:06.770> don't<00:03:06.890> want<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.220> be<00:03:07.340> using<00:03:07.700> any

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
really don't want to be using any

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.640 
really don't want to be using any
threshold<00:03:08.450> abilities<00:03:08.870> because<00:03:09.170> like

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
threshold abilities because like

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.280 
threshold abilities because like
abilities<00:03:10.160> such<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.370> rapid<00:03:10.910> fire<00:03:11.120> they<00:03:12.020> just

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
abilities such as rapid fire they just

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.380 
abilities such as rapid fire they just
take<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.250> bit<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.550> time<00:03:13.760> they<00:03:14.180> take<00:03:14.330> a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
take a little bit of time they take a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.690 
take a little bit of time they take a
few<00:03:14.630> too<00:03:14.810> many<00:03:14.840> tix<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.530> get<00:03:15.680> started<00:03:16.160> there's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
few too many tix to get started there's

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.100 
few too many tix to get started there's
really<00:03:16.850> no<00:03:17.060> reason<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.450> using<00:03:17.750> them<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.020> you

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
really no reason and using them so you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.479 
really no reason and using them so you
just<00:03:18.260> want<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.530> use<00:03:18.620> your<00:03:18.800> basics<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.459> then

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
just want to use your basics and then

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.250 
just want to use your basics and then
your<00:03:19.700> ultimate<00:03:20.120> once<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.959> have<00:03:21.020> your

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
your ultimate once you have your

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.800 
your ultimate once you have your

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
course if you do want to take it a

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.260 
course if you do want to take it a
little<00:03:26.390> more<00:03:26.570> slow<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.110> relaxed<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.800> can<00:03:28.270> use

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
little more slow and relaxed you can use

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.880 
little more slow and relaxed you can use
momentum<00:03:29.480> as<00:03:29.930> well<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.410> wouldn't

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
momentum as well I just wouldn't

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.260 
momentum as well I just wouldn't
recommend<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:31.670> really<00:03:31.940> want<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.150> get

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
recommend that if you really want to get

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.660 
recommend that if you really want to get
the<00:03:32.390> best<00:03:32.510> XP<00:03:32.930> per<00:03:33.050> hour<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> did<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.489> to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
the best XP per hour so I did have to

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.220 
the best XP per hour so I did have to
leave<00:03:34.880> all<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.180> drops<00:03:35.420> on<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.630> ground<00:03:35.930> while

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
collector just means that you don't have

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.009 
collector just means that you don't have
to<00:04:16.040> run<00:04:16.190> around<00:04:16.310> which<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.910> also<00:04:17.390> really<00:04:17.750> nice

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
to run around which is also really nice

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.490 
to run around which is also really nice
so<00:04:18.770> anyway<00:04:19.479> also<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.510> recorded<00:04:21.169> this<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.440> a

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
so anyway also I recorded this in a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.990 
so anyway also I recorded this in a
larger<00:04:21.799> screen<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.220> if<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.430> framerate<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:22.970> a

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
larger screen so if the framerate is a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.560 
larger screen so if the framerate is a
bit<00:04:23.270> bug

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
bit bug

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.350 
bit bug
I am<00:04:24.370> speeding<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.490> up<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:25.970> frame<00:04:26.180> rate

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
I am speeding this up so the frame rate

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.640 
I am speeding this up so the frame rate
shouldn't<00:04:26.600> be<00:04:26.660> too<00:04:26.810> much<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:26.990> an<00:04:27.170> issue<00:04:27.290> but

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
shouldn't be too much of an issue but

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.170 
shouldn't be too much of an issue but
foremost<00:04:28.130> my<00:04:28.370> guides<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.850> stuff<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.120> the
