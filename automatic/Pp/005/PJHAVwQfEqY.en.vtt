00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
and today we're gonna discuss flourishes

and today we're gonna discuss flourishes
okay<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> move<00:00:07.649> that's<00:00:07.890> called<00:00:08.160> it's

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
okay this is a move that's called it's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.919 
okay this is a move that's called it's
known<00:00:08.639> as<00:00:08.790> springing<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> cards<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:09.780> hand

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
known as springing the cards from hand

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.820 
known as springing the cards from hand
to<00:00:10.050> hand<00:00:11.870> it's<00:00:12.870> difficult<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.500> slow

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
to hand it's difficult to do slow

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.440 
to hand it's difficult to do slow
obviously<00:00:14.400> because<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.639> works<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.940> gravity

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
obviously because it works on gravity

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.689 
obviously because it works on gravity
and<00:00:15.599> delivering<00:00:15.960> cards<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.859> pressure<00:00:17.250> but

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and delivering cards from a pressure but

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.050 
and delivering cards from a pressure but
it<00:00:17.820> basically<00:00:18.180> looks<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:19.010> in<00:00:20.060> fast

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
it basically looks like this in fast

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960 
it basically looks like this in fast
speed<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:22.279> slowed<00:00:23.279> down<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.820> you're

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
speed and slowed down what you're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
speed and slowed down what you're
actually<00:00:24.119> doing<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:25.170> you're<00:00:25.410> holding<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
actually doing is you're holding the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
actually doing is you're holding the
cards<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.430> these<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.760> fingers<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.210> top<00:00:27.449> your

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
cards with these two fingers on top your

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
cards with these two fingers on top your
thumb<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> bottom<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.849> there's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
thumb on the bottom and there's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
thumb on the bottom and there's
different<00:00:30.330> variations<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.140> sometimes

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
different variations for this sometimes

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
different variations for this sometimes
people<00:00:32.430> use<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.850> three<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.020> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
people use all three and just do this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.880 
people use all three and just do this
some<00:00:35.190> people<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.550> use<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.910> four<00:00:36.620> using<00:00:37.620> four

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
some people will use all four using four

some people will use all four using four
actually<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> cards<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.110> choppy

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
actually can make the cards more choppy

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
bottom the bottom hand is really the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
bottom the bottom hand is really the
most<00:00:52.739> important<00:00:53.219> thing<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> practice

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
most important thing here to practice

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.580 
most important thing here to practice
the<00:00:54.480> springing<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> cards<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.440> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the springing of the cards you can just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
the springing of the cards you can just
springg<00:00:55.829> cards<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.480> table<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> practice

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
springg cards on the table to practice

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.500 
springg cards on the table to practice
that<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.430> motion<00:00:59.730> down<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.329> only

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that to get that motion down the only

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.400 
that to get that motion down the only
thing<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.020> doing<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
thing you're gonna be doing is you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.529 
thing you're gonna be doing is you
spring<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> pulling<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> hand<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
spring is pulling the hand back so it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
spring is pulling the hand back so it
makes<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> look<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> larger<00:01:04.559> ribbon<00:01:04.890> than

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
makes it look like a larger ribbon than

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
makes it look like a larger ribbon than
it<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it really is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
it really is
but<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> most<00:01:07.740> important<00:01:08.159> thing<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> hand

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but the most important thing is the hand

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
but the most important thing is the hand
below<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.119> catching<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> cards<00:01:09.869> if

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
below that's catching the cards if

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
below that's catching the cards if
you're<00:01:10.650> beginning<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> spring<00:01:11.640> cards<00:01:12.030> and

you're beginning to spring cards and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.310 
you're beginning to spring cards and
your<00:01:12.270> hands<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.200> gonna

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
your hands like that they're gonna

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.840 
your hands like that they're gonna
spring<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.040> fall<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.580> out<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> your

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
spring and just fall right out of your

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.929 
spring and just fall right out of your
hands<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:16.409> finger<00:01:16.820> middle<00:01:17.820> finger

hands your first finger middle finger
and<00:01:18.360> thumb<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> create<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.310> type

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and thumb kind of create this this type

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280 
and thumb kind of create this this type
of<00:01:20.700> net<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> cards<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.780> spring<00:01:22.049> into

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
of net that the cards will spring into

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
of net that the cards will spring into
your<00:01:23.100> ring<00:01:23.610> finger<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:23.970> pinky<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.840> our

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
your ring finger and pinky just our

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
your ring finger and pinky just our
extra<00:01:25.560> support<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.939> type<00:01:27.180> of

extra support so you have this type of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
extra support so you have this type of
thing<00:01:27.479> happening<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> cards<00:01:28.320> just

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thing happening where the cards just

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
thing happening where the cards just
cascade<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> hand<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.390> fall

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
there it's known as a mitt without that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
there it's known as a mitt without that
mitt<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.290> run<00:01:34.500> some<00:01:34.740> problems<00:01:35.070> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
mitt you're gonna run some problems so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.149 
mitt you're gonna run some problems so
just<00:01:35.189> practice<00:01:35.490> springing<00:01:36.150> cards<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
just practice springing cards into that

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.340 
just practice springing cards into that
mitt<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:39.479> stop<00:01:39.840> they<00:01:40.079> should<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
mitt and they stop they should be

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
mitt and they stop they should be
hitting<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> first<00:01:40.950> finger<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.659> parts<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.960 
the hand and bouncing around so that
they<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.790> stay<00:01:45.030> together<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> full-speed<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
they all stay together so full-speed it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
they all stay together so full-speed it
should<00:01:48.119> look<00:01:48.180> something<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.810> some

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
should look something like that some

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.460 
should look something like that some
people<00:01:49.140> pull<00:01:49.590> back<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:51.200> they<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.259> one

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
people pull back like this they do one

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.889 
people pull back like this they do one
of<00:01:52.560> those<00:01:52.619> things<00:01:53.149> it's<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.240> necessary<00:01:54.630> some

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
of those things it's not necessary some

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
of those things it's not necessary some
people<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.259> from<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> thumb<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.280> would

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
people use from the thumb I would

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
people use from the thumb I would
suggest<00:01:56.909> learning<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.020> proper<00:01:58.259> technique

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
suggest learning the proper technique

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
suggest learning the proper technique
first<00:01:58.979> before<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.670> springing<00:02:00.210> from<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
first before you're springing from the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.670 
first before you're springing from the
back<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> thumb<00:02:01.110> you'll<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.469> more

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
back of the thumb you'll have more

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399 
back of the thumb you'll have more
control<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.130> way<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> proper

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
control that way but this is the proper

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.039 
control that way but this is the proper
technique<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:05.610> learn<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
technique to learn and to use and just

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.990 
technique to learn and to use and just
make<00:02:07.200> sure<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.979> bottom<00:02:08.340> hand<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> catches

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
make sure the bottom hand that catches

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.510 
make sure the bottom hand that catches
everything<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.679> key<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> that's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
everything is the key for that that's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.710 
everything is the key for that that's
called<00:02:11.760> springing<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> cards<00:02:12.360> from<00:02:12.450> hand<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
called springing the cards from hand to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.070 
called springing the cards from hand to
hand

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
hand

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.870 
hand
you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
