00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello girls that welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:06.180
 and welcome to this video to a product 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.069
 of the week I want it recorded in the minutes 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.490
 that this video although I upload it 6th of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.000
 May I record it on April 22 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.269
 mainly because I'm getting ahead 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 task for because the month of the month of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.700
 May I will not be able to record practically 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.930
 nothing because I'm going to be in Barcelona 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.910
 good 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.530
 the second half of May is worth the first 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.660
 mid- May so I'll be able to record 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.340
 I did not want to take the bull 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.840
 so I'm recording some videos of 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.780
 way a little bit ahead of that because 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.910
 I need to finally have the month of May 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.160
 done before because I do not want 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.809
 slow down in the month of May 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.880
 at the end of the month I will explain that there will be 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.489
 news this summer in terms of 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.000
 video and blog and others but mainly 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.770
 I want to keep pace and that's why 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.540
 anyway 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.370
 more than anything you know that from 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.770
 now many of the videos that you see 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 well that they are recorded a bit with 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.700
 Previously it but I hope not 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.620
 bother 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.180
 I'm going to start shining because neither 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.040
 a lot of introduction is needed in these 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.260
 videos and I think I'm going to start 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.360
 with a little gift commission recently a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.000
 mallorca edition my sister-in-law did 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.250
 sonia 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.530
 for more good for our plans not 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.530
 but both she and I are clues 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.450
 we are from the beginning of March and we decided 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.979
 doing it is a gift now when we 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 we saw in mallorca that we saw 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.530
 little bit 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 I gave her some little things she gave me 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 others the truth is that we have left 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
 very happy with our gifts 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.770
 From here I send you a kiss that you know 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.060
 I love I love it and I love it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 What you gave me, I want you to know that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.670
 I use it quite one of the things of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.440
 done well gave me these two little things 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 and one of them is this cup of 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.040
 mystery wonderful that is for infusions 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.229
 and you know that I love the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.980
 infusions in fact I only drink that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.080
 practically 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.420
 and put you with superpowers to be 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.070
 happy as a partridge and the truth that I 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.070
 It seems a super cucada 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.670
 I love the cup I love the size 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.859
 it's a little smaller than I am 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.539
 used to but I love it and in fact 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.280
 because now I do not have it I do not have a wash 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.670
 but it also came as a kind of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.380
 with a filter to make me 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 infusions with 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.410
 that without bags or with the leaves 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.270
 and seriously the cup is magnificent and the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.650
 I'm using a lot I love it and another 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.150
 thing that he gave me and that is 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.700
 very charming and that he liked 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.560
 a lot these last weeks are all 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.890
 When I was in Mallorca I used it luxe 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.570
 very much and it is from the way of dior is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.100
 in the tone gave x 578 of those of the addict and 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.050
 is the pink that I wear right now in the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.170
 lips that is beautiful is very like very 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.170
 natural and sweet is really the truth 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.140
 the formulation these lipsticks unless 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.600
 this lipstick and this range I suppose is 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 as very moisturizing we very much spend our lives 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.260
 with colour 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.030
 but it has a little lip with the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.530
 I do not know if it's done to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.990
 purpose or is it simply the pigment 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.760
 that's the way the color I love is everything 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.940
 a hit because I love this guy 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.940
 of roses as you know if there is a nest 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.800
 me that they gave me pink seriously and nothing what 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.060
 You know a lot of fact I like it so much 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.490
 this lipstick that I used in the session 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.490
 Private with the photographer is this 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.950
 older week so I was I love it 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.840
 I love I love it and they are really and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.430
 you hit a lot with the color you 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.570
 I send a huge kiss again it is us 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.710
 done before but good I send you a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.600
 kiss because you are a sun 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.710
 many of you will want a sister-in-law 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.310
 like mine 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.230
 what do you find 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.060
 in the end I pass to the other favorite of 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.610
 makeup that I wanted to teach you and is the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.910
 face and body of mac 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.310
 I am 12 2 and I am an abc 2025 I am 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.840
 a little there in the middle so zeros wta 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.790
 fantastic is a base on a base of 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.070
 makeup based on water is to say that 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.040
 it is totally is practically water is 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.050
 very very watery there are many ways of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.820
 work it to be more or less 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.790
 Covers can be brushed by 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.230
 layers can be worked on hands and 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.510
 then apply it on the face for nothing 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 so that it is more opaque 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.180
 it's ideal for photography was put on each 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.860
 body because once it settles it is 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.080
 resistant all 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.940
 and I'm not liking a lot about 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.260
 everything to use it mixed with other 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.329
 makeup bases although today by 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.590
 example I take her alone in fact also 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.270
 I really like to use alone but 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.920
 I mainly bought it to mix it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.800
 with more matt make-up bases and more 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.450
 more long lasting let's say to make them 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.610
 more natural for now facing 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.960
 summer because the truth is that there are days 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.370
 in which I put my bases on 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.980
 Make up, always the ones that I 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.550
 they like type then the distillate of double 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.230
 wear light or to estimate or 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.700
 lumiÃ¨re perception of chanel for example 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.660
 the equality of where of the mary 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.390
 kay that right now are my most 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.520
 favorite ones because the fact is that what I 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.840
 like they are bases that I love but there 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.270
 days when I put them in January the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 very heavy skin as very congested 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.220
 by the base as very artificial and the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.980
 true is that doing fifty-fifty with this 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.470
 makeup base makes them less 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.090
 less opaque mattresses more natural 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.190
 but they still have those properties 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.790
 of the control of brightness and the truth is 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.090
 what is that mixed with other 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.040
 the tab mod and it does not shine 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.830
 used alone to have such a finish 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.080
 juicy yet I did not just decide if it's 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.090
 good for oily skin at the moment 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.100
 I do not like it, it does not take out granites either 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.750
 that there are people who complain a lot that 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.100
 they leave pimples with fission body to me 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.100
 Nor it has happened to me has used it 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.920
 many days in a row so good 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.780
 or has been followed alone I do not know if I'm 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.250
 explaining but the fact is that nothing 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.280
 he's really enjoying it and had to take 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.440
 the favorites and here's the last 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.230
 favorite of the week I did not want to wait 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.670
 more the game of thrones is 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.490
 I love the season 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.050
 charming I do not know if it still exceeds 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.090
 first season and the third that stops 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.540
 me are the best of the four that have 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.160
 stepped out 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.480
 the first because I think the most 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.480
 complete and the most let's say 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.800
 that have more or less the same level 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:07.479
 throughout the season the third 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.180
 has some very lazy moments and 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.529
 some incredible moments and very 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.960
 spectacular of there that the third 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.969
 for me it will possibly be almost the best 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.550
 season together with the first the 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.249
 second for me it was pretty loose and the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.879
 fourth is being very intense 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.770
 mainly because the third book 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.569
 he left another one happens to us what does not happen in 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.759
 the whole saga and they had to do both 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.860
 seasons and that's the fourth season 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.650
 it's being very intense and very good 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.029
 Tyrion is talking too much 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.839
 jamie is having an evolution of 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:39.460
 character that I love dainelis every 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.430
 I like it less is a character that 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.050
 at first I loved 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.850
 but good in general the series is 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.440
 flying mogollÃ³n every time I like more 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.480
 the whole plot of the wall that used to be 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.630
 how to do and each time I like more the 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.370
 plot of the wall so nothing game of 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.040
 thrones I do not want to spoil anything because 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.630
 series because in short, much 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.640
 series see it almost everyone always 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.070
 there are people who are a little behind with the 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.630
 series or that has not yet seen see the 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.640
 series because I was waiting to read the 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.320
 books I know stuff like that so I do not 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.030
 you think you fight anything but good that we are 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.490
 giving mogollÃ³n 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.050
 seriously all of you who see the game of 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.370
 thrones because the good thing is that the 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.680
 spring is that it starts to match 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.970
 thrones too so nothing I am 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.800
 enjoying a lot I feel very sorry 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.690
 When the season ends, it will give me
