00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
permaculture and we'll be applying those

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410

things<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> gardens<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.059> we're<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.270> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
things to the gardens and we're going to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
things to the gardens and we're going to
try<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> maximize<00:00:49.340> our<00:00:50.539> yields<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.039> also

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
try to maximize our yields and also

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
try to maximize our yields and also
remediate<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.820> soil<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.750> three

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
remediate the soil we have three

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.189 
remediate the soil we have three
thousand<00:00:55.590> square<00:00:55.890> feet<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.050> what<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
thousand square feet here and what we're

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
thousand square feet here and what we're
doing<00:00:58.230> every<00:00:58.710> day<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.250> double<00:00:59.940> digging<00:01:00.149> which

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
doing every day is double digging which

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
doing every day is double digging which
is<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.050> Amy's<00:01:01.350> doing<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:01.949> throw<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
is what Amy's doing right now throw the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.410 
is what Amy's doing right now throw the
leaves<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:04.049> pump<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.420> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
leaves down this pump will go in this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.469 
leaves down this pump will go in this
will<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.960> flipped<00:01:07.439> over<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.479> grass

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
will get flipped over so that grass

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.910 
will get flipped over so that grass
layer<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> clump<00:01:10.619> goes<00:01:10.890> down

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
layer on the clump goes down

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.120 
layer on the clump goes down
so<00:01:12.430> we're<00:01:12.610> working<00:01:12.880> nutrients<00:01:13.750> down<00:01:14.049> into<00:01:14.979> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
so we're working nutrients down into the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.320 
so we're working nutrients down into the
soil<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:17.530> put<00:01:17.799> some<00:01:18.040> oyster<00:01:18.850> shells<00:01:19.119> in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
soil and we put some oyster shells in

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.270 
soil and we put some oyster shells in
there<00:01:19.479> for<00:01:19.720> calcium<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.830> then<00:01:20.979> what<00:01:21.159> we're

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
there for calcium and then what we're

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.679 
there for calcium and then what we're
going<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.460> do<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.640> cover<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.090> back<00:01:22.330> up<00:01:22.360> with

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
going to do is cover this back up with

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.399 
going to do is cover this back up with
those<00:01:22.869> draw<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.430> are<00:01:24.640> going<00:01:24.909> anywhere<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
those draw and are going anywhere and

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.039 
those draw and are going anywhere and
we're<00:01:26.799> going<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.950> let<00:01:27.070> this<00:01:27.250> sit<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.899> then

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
we're going to let this sit and then

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.240 
we're going to let this sit and then
we'll<00:01:29.200> come<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.789> and<00:01:30.789> remove<00:01:31.119> all<00:01:31.330> this<00:01:31.509> draw

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
we'll come in and remove all this draw

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.850 
we'll come in and remove all this draw

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
this water flows off this land and takes

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.499 
this water flows off this land and takes

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
land and puts it down in here down in

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.359 
land and puts it down in here down in
this<00:01:55.810> flat<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.679> takes<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.039> into<00:01:57.190> the

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
this flat and it takes it into the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.160 
this flat and it takes it into the
streets<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.299> not<00:01:58.509> where<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:58.869> want<00:01:59.080> it

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
streets and that's not where we want it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.980 
streets and that's not where we want it
so<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.799> see<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.130> troughs<00:02:00.990> they're

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
so you can see the troughs they're

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.529 
so you can see the troughs they're
flowing<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.560> water<00:02:02.770> down<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.580> set<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:04.000> bio

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
flowing the water down to the set of bio

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.380 
flowing the water down to the set of bio
swales<00:02:04.990> there<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.590> then<00:02:06.459> the<00:02:06.700> water<00:02:06.880> here

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
swales there and then the water here

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.990

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
that happens so the these roads started

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.830 
that happens so the these roads started
to<00:05:26.440> get<00:05:26.560> right<00:05:26.770> first<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.460> i<00:05:27.669> would<00:05:27.850> pick<00:05:28.090> and

these rows would start to ripen and i
would<00:05:33.400> pick<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.940> then<00:05:34.510> these<00:05:34.690> roads<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.110> start
