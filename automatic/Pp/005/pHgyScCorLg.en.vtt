00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 3 years 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 why 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.600
 who speak 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.840
 I ask now 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 us 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 Mikhail Varnakov most productive 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.610
 The player recently played the leopard ak 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.130
 most stable triple but for some reason 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 last matches in two away matches 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.409
 your personal gain was enough to win 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 that the team may be tired 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.340
 it seems that everything is not very 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 cool but I wouldn't talk about 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.220
 some global there obshchak well maybe 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.180
 did not develop a share immediately following up 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.270
 There is a little more time before the dress 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.690
 Belarus mistakes do the job today 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.760
 scored steps in the end it seemed that from 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.710
 you can break something not 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.110
 enough quite a bit can not be 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.320
 good luck in the end was not enough steam 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.540
 moments to level the score on my 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.950
 sarina 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.040
 know the impression that we are somehow hard 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.550
 the entrance to the match is also the first period 2 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 last two days so all you need 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.000
 relax on our coach climb 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 shadow good luck with your home game and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.150
 saturated winter order 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 Thanks, you will try not + key 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370
 but
