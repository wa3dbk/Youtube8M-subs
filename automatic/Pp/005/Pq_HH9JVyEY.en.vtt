00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
is to put it in the freezer for about 10

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.639 
is to put it in the freezer for about 10
minutes<00:01:42.969> and<00:01:43.969> then<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.420> slice<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> really

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
minutes and then it slice is a really

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.910 
minutes and then it slice is a really
nice<00:01:45.950> insect

peppers if you don't have the mini ones

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.430 
peppers if you don't have the mini ones
you<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.520> use<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.880> large<00:02:22.120> size<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:23.290> like

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you can use a large size I just like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440 
you can use a large size I just like
using<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.950> mini<00:02:24.130> ones<00:02:24.400> sometimes<00:02:24.700> because

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
using the mini ones sometimes because

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.870 
using the mini ones sometimes because
you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.900> get<00:02:26.140> them<00:02:26.320> in<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.530> bag<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.220> mixed

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
you can get them in a bag of mixed

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.449 
you can get them in a bag of mixed
colors<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:28.959> usually<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.590> orange<00:02:30.070> yellow

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459
