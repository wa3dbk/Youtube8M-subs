00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
night when I made my rob review i was

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439 
night when I made my rob review i was
you<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.740> wondering<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.970> happens<00:00:24.269> next

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you know wondering what happens next

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
you know wondering what happens next
because<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> saw<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.890> possible<00:00:26.519> scenarios

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
because I I saw two possible scenarios

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
because I I saw two possible scenarios
two<00:00:27.240> possible<00:00:27.720> matches<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.199> could<00:00:28.560> take

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
two possible matches that could take

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.849 
two possible matches that could take
place<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:29.400> Extreme<00:00:30.060> Rules<00:00:30.380> one<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.650> being

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
place at Extreme Rules one of them being

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.600 
place at Extreme Rules one of them being
the<00:00:31.949> shield's<00:00:32.780> vs.<00:00:33.780> Triple<00:00:34.110> H<00:00:34.410> Batista<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the shield's vs. Triple H Batista and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.190 
the shield's vs. Triple H Batista and
Randy<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:36.450> much<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> shield<00:00:36.899> vs

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
Randy pretty much the shield vs

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770 
Randy pretty much the shield vs
evolution<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
evolution which is what I really want to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.090 
evolution which is what I really want to
see<00:00:40.219> but<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.180> other<00:00:42.329> scenario<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.680> was

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
see but the other scenario could see was

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.869 
see but the other scenario could see was
the<00:00:44.340> shield<00:00:44.700> vs<00:00:45.390> kane<00:00:45.829> Batista<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> Randy<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the shield vs kane Batista and Randy and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.799 
the shield vs kane Batista and Randy and
that<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.140> seems<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.980> likely<00:00:50.600> given<00:00:51.600> what

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that one seems more likely given what

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
that one seems more likely given what
happened<00:00:51.989> last<00:00:52.320> night<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.620> Raw<00:00:53.010> lesson<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.000> Raw

that Triple H needs a non-title Vic
three<00:02:03.090> overs<00:02:03.360> any<00:02:03.540> Brian<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.890> put

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
three overs any Brian to you know put

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.990 
three overs any Brian to you know put
himself<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> championship<00:02:06.180> match<00:02:06.770> but

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
himself in the championship match but

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.119 
himself in the championship match but
you<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.869> seems<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
you know it's it seems like the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.309 
you know it's it seems like the
direction<00:02:11.310> they're<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
direction they're going is

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.800 
direction they're going is
more<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.849> one<00:02:15.150> where<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.569> not

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
more so this one where it's not

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.199 
more so this one where it's not
evolution<00:02:16.620> versus<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.249> shield<00:02:17.519> maybe<00:02:17.819> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
evolution versus the shield maybe you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.629 
evolution versus the shield maybe you
know<00:02:18.299> maybe<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:18.719> yet<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:20.159> I<00:02:20.249> think<00:02:20.310> it's

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
know maybe not yet because I think it's

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.089 
know maybe not yet because I think it's
going<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.819> happen<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.530> before<00:02:22.650> that

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
going to happen but I think before that

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.849 
going to happen but I think before that
we<00:02:24.060> might<00:02:24.239> get<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.749> which<00:02:25.139> is<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.409> closest

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
we might get this which is the closest

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.800 
we might get this which is the closest
thing<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.340> shield<00:02:26.700> vs<00:02:27.030> evolution<00:02:27.269> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
thing to the shield vs evolution and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.170 
thing to the shield vs evolution and
then<00:02:28.349> maybe<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.769> episode<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.189> raw<00:02:29.549> we<00:02:30.000> could

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
then maybe on an episode of raw we could

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.750 
then maybe on an episode of raw we could
get<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.510> match<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.700> initially<00:02:32.700> thought

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
get that match now I initially thought

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.280 
get that match now I initially thought
that<00:02:32.909> Extreme<00:02:33.389> Rules<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.810> was<00:02:33.930> either<00:02:34.109> gonna

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that Extreme Rules it was either gonna

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.800 
that Extreme Rules it was either gonna
be<00:02:34.530> Daniel<00:02:34.920> Bryan<00:02:35.159> vs<00:02:35.489> randy<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.510> rematch

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
be Daniel Bryan vs randy in a rematch

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.869 
be Daniel Bryan vs randy in a rematch
for<00:02:37.049> the<00:02:37.079> championship<00:02:37.560> or<00:02:37.889> a<00:02:38.159> rematch<00:02:38.579> of<00:02:38.609> the

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
for the championship or a rematch of the

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.959 
for the championship or a rematch of the
actual<00:02:39.180> triple<00:02:39.599> threat<00:02:39.930> match<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:41.400> now<00:02:41.639> after

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
actual triple threat match but now after

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.360 
actual triple threat match but now after
what<00:02:42.510> happened<00:02:42.780> last<00:02:42.870> night<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.379> seems<00:02:44.010> more

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
what happened last night it seems more

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.869 
what happened last night it seems more
like<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:45.329> going<00:02:45.719> to<00:02:45.870> be<00:02:46.019> daniel<00:02:46.500> bryan<00:02:46.879> vs.

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
like it's going to be daniel bryan vs.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.449 
like it's going to be daniel bryan vs.
