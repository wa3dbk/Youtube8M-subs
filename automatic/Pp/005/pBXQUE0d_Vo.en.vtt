lamps or so I have the yellow fog lamps
I<00:04:10.349> don't<00:04:10.499> think<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:10.980> not<00:04:11.129> foggy<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.999> we

on this time I think tremendous

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.039 
on this time I think tremendous

suspension up slyly there we go that

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.310 
suspension up slyly there we go that
should<00:04:56.009> do<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.280> trick<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.570> there<00:04:57.720> we<00:04:57.840> go<00:04:57.870> lots

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
should do the trick so there we go lots

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.170 
should do the trick so there we go lots
of<00:04:58.470> things<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.919> play<00:04:59.099> with<00:04:59.130> Oh<00:04:59.490> something<00:05:00.120> else

of things to play with Oh something else

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.370 
of things to play with Oh something else
on<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.539> side<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.960> we've<00:05:01.080> been<00:05:01.199> playing

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
on this side that we've been playing

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.600 
on this side that we've been playing
with<00:05:01.470> all<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.740> way<00:05:01.830> along<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:02.070> road<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.460> this

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
with all the way along the road is this

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.210 
with all the way along the road is this
auto<00:05:02.880> volume<00:05:03.509> what<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.840> does<00:05:04.050> that<00:05:04.259> cuts<00:05:05.009> in

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
auto volume what that does that cuts in

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.700 
auto volume what that does that cuts in
around<00:05:05.729> about<00:05:05.970> 40<00:05:06.509> odd<00:05:06.780> 50<00:05:07.139> miles<00:05:07.349> per<00:05:07.560> hour

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
around about 40 odd 50 miles per hour

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.580 
around about 40 odd 50 miles per hour
and<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.699> increases<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.870> volume<00:05:10.259> of<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and that increases the volume of the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.710 
and that increases the volume of the
radio<00:05:10.710> cassette<00:05:11.099> as<00:05:11.490> your<00:05:12.000> speed<00:05:12.210> increases

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
radio cassette as your speed increases

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.360 
radio cassette as your speed increases
so<00:05:13.259> you<00:05:13.320> don't<00:05:13.530> need<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.710> leave<00:05:13.889> forward<00:05:14.250> and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
so you don't need to leave forward and

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.520 
so you don't need to leave forward and
turn<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.699> up<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:15.270> compensate<00:05:15.990> for<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.169> windows

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
turn it up to compensate for the windows

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.740 
turn it up to compensate for the windows
it's<00:05:17.310> all<00:05:17.460> automatic<00:05:17.880> if<00:05:18.449> thought<00:05:18.630> of

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
it's all automatic if thought of

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
it's all automatic if thought of
everything

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.400 

you
