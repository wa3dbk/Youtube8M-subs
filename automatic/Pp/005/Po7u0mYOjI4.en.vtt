that stay connected to your battery they

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120 
that stay connected to your battery they
allow<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> choose<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.979> want

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
allow you to choose which side you want

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
allow you to choose which side you want
the<00:01:26.340> battery<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the battery is down and they also have a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.440 
the battery is down and they also have a
couple<00:01:28.080> batteries<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.560> choose<00:01:28.770> from

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
couple batteries to choose from

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.520 
couple batteries to choose from
obviously<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> bigger<00:01:30.780> battery<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
obviously the bigger battery is going to

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
obviously the bigger battery is going to
last<00:01:31.680> longer<00:01:32.570> like<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> biggest<00:01:33.869> barrier

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
last longer like the biggest barrier

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
last longer like the biggest barrier
they<00:01:34.290> had<00:01:34.439> last<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> 10<00:01:35.159> years<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
