00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
think it grew hopefully so I've been

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
think it grew hopefully so I've been
trying<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> drink<00:01:47.310> more<00:01:47.460> water<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.030> I've<00:01:48.119> been

taking<00:01:48.390> biotin<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
taking biotin but I think I want to

have to take the straightener and curl
it<00:02:37.989> backwards<00:02:38.549> but<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.670> works<00:02:39.879> that<00:02:40.689> works

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
it backwards but it works that works

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.720 
it backwards but it works that works
really<00:02:40.930> well<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.709> way<00:02:41.829> it's<00:02:42.069> not<00:02:42.159> quite

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
really well so that way it's not quite

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.759 
really well so that way it's not quite
as<00:02:42.940> much<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.239> my<00:02:43.269> face<00:02:43.540> as<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.959> would<00:02:44.079> be<00:02:44.260> even

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
as much in my face as it would be even

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.890 
as much in my face as it would be even
though<00:02:44.889> it's<00:02:45.849> still<00:02:46.030> pretty<00:02:46.389> much<00:02:46.480> in<00:02:46.629> my<00:02:46.659> face

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
though it's still pretty much in my face

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.460 
though it's still pretty much in my face
um<00:02:47.579> yeah<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.540> you're<00:02:49.720> gonna<00:02:49.840> be<00:02:50.049> using<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
um yeah so if you're gonna be using a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.690 
um yeah so if you're gonna be using a
blow-dryer<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.980> straightener<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.639> do

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
blow-dryer in a straightener like I do

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.629 
blow-dryer in a straightener like I do
definitely<00:02:52.180> use<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> heat<00:02:53.230> protectant<00:02:53.639> um

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
definitely use a heat protectant um

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:55.770 
definitely use a heat protectant um
because<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.060> don't<00:02:55.239> want<00:02:55.389> your<00:02:55.510> hair<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.629> be

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
because you don't want your hair to be

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.770 
because you don't want your hair to be
trashed<00:02:56.109> my<00:02:57.099> shampoos<00:02:57.790> I'm<00:02:58.060> using<00:02:58.239> kind<00:02:58.659> of

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
trashed my shampoos I'm using kind of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.899 
trashed my shampoos I'm using kind of
protects<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.200> from<00:02:59.230> heat<00:02:59.620> from<00:03:00.129> elements<00:03:00.609> but

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
protects it from heat from elements but

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.699 
protects it from heat from elements but
I'm<00:03:01.000> also<00:03:01.150> using<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.840> heat<00:03:02.019> protectant<00:03:02.439> as<00:03:02.530> well

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
I'm also using a heat protectant as well

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
because the beanies are not the Venus

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.409 
because the beanies are not the Venus
the<00:03:27.040> hoodies<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.519> wear<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.909> that<00:03:27.970> coats

the hoodies that I wear and that coats

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.170 
the hoodies that I wear and that coats
that<00:03:28.659> I<00:03:28.690> wear<00:03:28.959> um<00:03:29.560> would<00:03:29.980> mess<00:03:30.159> with<00:03:30.190> my<00:03:30.459> hair

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
that I wear um would mess with my hair

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.390 
that I wear um would mess with my hair
but<00:03:32.049> now<00:03:32.199> since<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:32.560> warm<00:03:32.769> I'll<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.280> be

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
but now since it's warm I'll just be

but now since it's warm I'll just be
wearing<00:03:33.579> shirts<00:03:33.849> like<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.599> then<00:03:35.139> I

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
wearing shirts like this and then I

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.539 
wearing shirts like this and then I
won't<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.769> worry<00:03:35.919> about<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.430> I'm

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
won't have to worry about that and I'm

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.360 
won't have to worry about that and I'm
hoping<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.409> within<00:03:38.409> this<00:03:38.739> summer<00:03:38.979> months

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.460 
hoping that within this summer months
I'm<00:03:39.669> gonna<00:03:39.940> grow<00:03:40.180> enough<00:03:40.599> that<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.049> will<00:03:41.290> go

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.199 
I'm gonna grow enough that I will go
over<00:03:41.859> my<00:03:41.979> color<00:03:42.220> by<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.549> time<00:03:42.819> it's<00:03:43.000> like

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
over my color by the time it's like

over my color by the time it's like
September<00:03:44.169> or<00:03:44.500> maybe<00:03:44.859> even<00:03:44.919> like<00:03:45.629> October

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
September or maybe even like October

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.909 
September or maybe even like October
before<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.139> have<00:03:47.229> to<00:03:47.319> start<00:03:47.530> wearing<00:03:47.680> hoodies

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
before I have to start wearing hoodies

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.640 
before I have to start wearing hoodies
again<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.019> would<00:03:50.109> be<00:03:50.229> awesome

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
again and that would be awesome

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.789 
again and that would be awesome
so<00:03:50.979> we'll<00:03:51.129> see<00:03:51.250> what<00:03:51.489> happens<00:03:53.169> right<00:03:53.590> now<00:03:53.769> I

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
don't really know what else to do with

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.420 
don't really know what else to do with
my<00:03:55.090> hair<00:03:55.299> like<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> said<00:03:56.019> I'm<00:03:56.530> kind<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.859> doing<00:03:57.010> it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
my hair like I said I'm kind of doing it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.189 
my hair like I said I'm kind of doing it
the<00:03:57.609> shag<00:03:57.879> way<00:03:58.120> not<00:03:58.449> the<00:03:58.599> slicked<00:03:58.840> back<00:03:58.870> way

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
the shag way not the slicked back way

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.629 
the shag way not the slicked back way
cuz<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.560> just<00:03:59.829> don't<00:03:59.949> feel<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.069> it<00:04:00.310> works<00:04:00.489> as

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.599 
this works that fantastically on me but
I'm<00:04:05.440> doing<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.799> anyways<00:04:07.889> yeah<00:04:08.889> so<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.489> said

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.750 
I'm doing it anyways yeah so like I said
last<00:04:09.879> time<00:04:10.229> I've<00:04:11.229> been<00:04:11.260> coloring<00:04:11.949> my<00:04:12.190> hair<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
last time I've been coloring my hair and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.580 
last time I've been coloring my hair and
it's<00:04:13.150> hard<00:04:13.389> to<00:04:13.569> keep<00:04:13.690> up<00:04:13.870> with<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.199> I'm<00:04:14.409> hoping

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
it's hard to keep up with it I'm hoping

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.469 
it's hard to keep up with it I'm hoping
that<00:04:14.919> the<00:04:15.040> color<00:04:15.280> will<00:04:15.459> wash<00:04:15.609> out<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:15.879> my<00:04:16.030> hair

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
that the color will wash out of my hair

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.009 
that the color will wash out of my hair
I<00:04:16.510> know<00:04:16.900> colored<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.469> in<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:17.769> November<00:04:18.039> and

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
I know colored it in like November and

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.019 
I know colored it in like November and
most<00:04:20.019> people<00:04:20.409> complain<00:04:20.979> because<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.849> color

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.029 
most people complain because the color

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.129 
most people complain because the color
washes<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.570> their<00:04:22.750> hair<00:04:22.870> too

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
washes out of their hair too

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.129 
washes out of their hair too
quickly<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:25.060> would<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.419> like<00:04:25.689> the<00:04:26.110> most

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
quickly but this would be like the most

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.869 
quickly but this would be like the most
wonderful<00:04:26.469> situation<00:04:26.919> for<00:04:27.400> them<00:04:27.520> if<00:04:27.639> they<00:04:27.729> had

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
wonderful situation for them if they had

them<00:06:05.229> they're<00:06:05.409> like<00:06:05.680> two<00:06:06.039> dollars<00:06:06.279> maybe<00:06:06.879> up

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
them they're like two dollars maybe up

them they're like two dollars maybe up
to<00:06:06.969> five<00:06:07.210> dollars<00:06:07.389> so<00:06:07.870> they're<00:06:08.139> not<00:06:08.229> very
