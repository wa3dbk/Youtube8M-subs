I don't want to be that and I can I want
to<00:04:43.020> be<00:04:43.140> an<00:04:43.230> idea<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:44.790> know<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.150> want<00:04:45.360> to

to be an idea you know I want to

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.620 
to be an idea you know I want to
represent<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.290> idea<00:04:47.120> so<00:04:48.120> look<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.600> a

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
represent and idea so look for a

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.240 
represent and idea so look for a
top-speed<00:04:48.990> exercise<00:04:49.620> today<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.920> wanted<00:04:50.160> to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
top-speed exercise today I wanted to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.890 
top-speed exercise today I wanted to
share<00:04:50.460> with<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:50.760> guys<00:04:50.790> something<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.810> I

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
share with you guys something and I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900 
share with you guys something and I
think<00:04:51.960> it's<00:04:52.320> such<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> simple<00:04:53.040> tool<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.760> can

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
think it's such a simple tool you can

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.270 
think it's such a simple tool you can
utilize<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.690> correct<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.470> lot<00:04:55.680> of<00:04:55.740> your<00:04:56.010> top

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
utilize to correct a lot of your top

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.670 
utilize to correct a lot of your top
speed<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:57.060> often<00:04:57.480> I<00:04:57.600> talk<00:04:57.870> about<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
speed so often I talk about the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.980 
speed so often I talk about the
mechanics<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.610> lower<00:04:59.820> body<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.420> cycling

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
mechanics of the lower body and cycling

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.010 
mechanics of the lower body and cycling
when<00:05:01.170> you're<00:05:01.350> in<00:05:01.470> top<00:05:01.680> speed
