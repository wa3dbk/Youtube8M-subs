because<00:03:16.270> they're<00:03:16.510> actually<00:03:17.230> easier<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.830> my

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
because they're actually easier on my

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.740 
because they're actually easier on my
feet<00:03:18.220> which<00:03:18.459> probably<00:03:18.880> doesn't<00:03:19.420> make<00:03:19.540> sense

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
feet which probably doesn't make sense

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.699 
feet which probably doesn't make sense
to<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.959> lot<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.140> people<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.769> that's<00:03:21.730> just<00:03:22.030> me

boost<00:05:08.280> me<00:05:08.430> up<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.909> enough<00:05:09.270> these<00:05:09.539> are<00:05:09.659> what

boost me up just enough these are what
they<00:05:09.840> look<00:05:09.870> like<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.669> lastly<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:12.180> I<00:05:12.240> would

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
they look like and lastly and I would

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.100 
they look like and lastly and I would
say<00:05:12.690> these<00:05:12.930> are<00:05:12.990> probably<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.740> only<00:05:14.039> ones

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110

I<00:05:24.930> go<00:05:25.050> shopping<00:05:25.349> that's<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:25.889> my<00:05:26.039> style<00:05:26.250> to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
I go shopping that's not my style to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.429 
I go shopping that's not my style to
force<00:05:26.789> me<00:05:26.969> to<00:05:27.000> take<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.300> little<00:05:27.569> risk<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.169> jump

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
force me to take a little risk and jump

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.790 
force me to take a little risk and jump
out<00:05:28.590> of<00:05:28.620> my<00:05:28.770> comfort<00:05:29.009> zone<00:05:29.300> but<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:30.840> don't<00:05:31.740> know

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
out of my comfort zone but I don't know

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.050 
out of my comfort zone but I don't know
about<00:05:31.979> these<00:05:32.159> ones<00:05:32.370> these<00:05:32.550> might<00:05:32.729> be<00:05:32.879> one<00:05:33.029> of

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
about these ones these might be one of

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.969 
about these ones these might be one of
those<00:05:33.210> ones<00:05:33.539> that<00:05:33.750> I<00:05:33.779> buy<00:05:34.050> hoping<00:05:34.710> to<00:05:34.770> take<00:05:34.919> a

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
those ones that I buy hoping to take a

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.709 
those ones that I buy hoping to take a
risk<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:35.639> then<00:05:35.789> they<00:05:35.879> just<00:05:36.029> end<00:05:36.180> up<00:05:36.240> camping

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
risk and then they just end up camping

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.360 
risk and then they just end up camping
out<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:36.930> my<00:05:36.990> closet<00:05:37.440> they<00:05:37.620> were<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.889> sale<00:05:38.129> so<00:05:38.190> I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
out in my closet they were on sale so I

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.320 
out in my closet they were on sale so I
think<00:05:38.580> that's<00:05:38.699> probably<00:05:38.819> why<00:05:39.060> they<00:05:39.210> were<00:05:39.270> a

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
think that's probably why they were a

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.990 
think that's probably why they were a
little<00:05:39.449> tempting<00:05:39.900> here<00:05:40.319> they<00:05:40.529> are<00:05:41.000> also

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
little tempting here they are also

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.360 
little tempting here they are also
another<00:05:42.509> Python<00:05:42.870> pattern<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:43.860> these<00:05:44.099> ones

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
another Python pattern but these ones

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.290 
another Python pattern but these ones
are<00:05:44.610> gladiators<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:46.050> lace<00:05:46.469> up<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.300> they

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
are gladiators that lace up and they

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.629 
are gladiators that lace up and they
also<00:05:48.509> have<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.139> gold<00:05:49.440> heel<00:05:49.800> detail<00:05:50.250> which<00:05:50.490> I

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
also have a gold heel detail which I

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.490 
also have a gold heel detail which I
really<00:05:50.940> like<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.389> zipper<00:05:51.690> in<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:51.990> back<00:05:52.199> which

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
really like a zipper in the back which

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.649 
really like a zipper in the back which
doesn't<00:05:52.949> really<00:05:53.099> work<00:05:53.430> at<00:05:53.759> least<00:05:54.029> not<00:05:54.449> what<00:05:54.629> I

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
doesn't really work at least not what I

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.879 
doesn't really work at least not what I
tried<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.529> I<00:05:55.710> guess<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.069> part<00:05:56.370> that<00:05:56.819> I'm

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
tried it and I guess the part that I'm

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.409 
tried it and I guess the part that I'm
particularly<00:05:58.889> if<00:05:59.009> the<00:05:59.129> about<00:05:59.370> is<00:05:59.610> this<00:06:00.000> long

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
particularly if the about is this long

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.869 
particularly if the about is this long
lace<00:06:01.199> that<00:06:01.500> we<00:06:01.650> have<00:06:01.889> here<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:02.520> definitely

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
lace that we have here you definitely

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.550 
lace that we have here you definitely
can't<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.240> tie<00:06:03.389> it<00:06:03.449> in<00:06:03.629> a<00:06:03.690> bow<00:06:03.900> that'll<00:06:04.379> just

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
can't just tie it in a bow that'll just

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.829 
can't just tie it in a bow that'll just
drag<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.099> get<00:06:05.190> dirty<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.550> yucky<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.210> tied<00:06:06.810> it

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839 
drag and get dirty and yucky I tied it

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.409 
drag and get dirty and yucky I tied it
around<00:06:06.990> my<00:06:07.289> ankle<00:06:07.800> which<00:06:08.159> kind<00:06:09.089> of<00:06:09.210> looked<00:06:09.330> a

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
around my ankle which kind of looked a

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.809 
around my ankle which kind of looked a
little<00:06:09.690> bulky<00:06:10.289> so<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.680> don't<00:06:11.039> know<00:06:11.099> if<00:06:11.279> I<00:06:11.580> would

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
little bulky so I don't know if I would

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.640 
little bulky so I don't know if I would
maybe<00:06:11.969> just<00:06:12.330> like<00:06:12.449> cut<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.779> lace<00:06:13.050> but<00:06:13.319> part<00:06:13.560> of

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
maybe just like cut the lace but part of

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.140 
maybe just like cut the lace but part of
what<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.800> like<00:06:14.009> about<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.460> is<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.819> they<00:06:15.000> have

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
what I like about it is that they have

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.059 
what I like about it is that they have
these<00:06:15.330> little<00:06:15.599> gold<00:06:15.839> knobs<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.560> bottom<00:06:16.919> I
