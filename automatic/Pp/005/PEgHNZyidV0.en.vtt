these bars are absolutely identical but
they're<00:01:35.900> not<00:01:36.079> come<00:01:36.500> on<00:01:36.650> in<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:36.890> take<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.070> closer

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
they're not come on in and take a closer

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.910 
they're not come on in and take a closer
look<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:38.630> particular<00:01:39.200> set<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.470> drag<00:01:39.650> bars

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
look this particular set of drag bars

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.179 
look this particular set of drag bars
here<00:01:40.220> has<00:01:40.549> been<00:01:40.810> dimpled<00:01:41.810> what<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.860> dimpling

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
here has been dimpled what the dimpling

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.219 
here has been dimpled what the dimpling
does<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.610> allows<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.329> run<00:01:44.540> your<00:01:44.689> handlebar

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
does it allows you to run your handlebar

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.499 
does it allows you to run your handlebar
