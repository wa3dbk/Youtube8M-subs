00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 According to the film type single-lens reflex camera that I examined this nicomart ft 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.390
 The camera is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.700

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.380

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.300
 3 It is written as con Japan is written now 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.060
 So this is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.410
 Nikon's 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.920
 Well I here in camera wonder if However

 It is a brand camera that wintering grounds Nikon f 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.990
 If there is a Well quite a camera or rather the best camera 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.439
 But it is not affordable 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.950
 It's a cheap version 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:36.460
 Do Tteyuu a lot manufactured camera that Kaimo del Do it this Nikomato 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:39.980
 And it seemed say look will be to model that of the guy ft called the Nikomato 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:46.630
 The shape is as you see it and it's already a crash district 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:50.890
 It's a camera or a camera at that time, but it's not really digital. 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:57.810
 This Ano Once'm I here attempted to open 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:03.750

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.549
 The film gold ones Contains back another really I here have over there interest finder 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.409
 In the feeling that there is only 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.239
 On top 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.459

 Shopper button 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.750
 So what is the feature of this camera , but it was out or along 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.890

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 Just turn around here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:46.100
 It seems that something is decided, according to the articles I searched for 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 It seems like you have to play with yourself by yourself. 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.120
 Was written but it is 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.910
 This kind of analog film camera 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.030

 I understand, but film cameras are not that good 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.629
 Because it is a film, put in 24 sheets 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.930
 Take a look at the finder and take a car 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.640
