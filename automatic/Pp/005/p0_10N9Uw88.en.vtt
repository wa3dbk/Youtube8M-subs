00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.650
 yes 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.710
 and good to all the people of youtube here 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.740
 we have another game for what is the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.210
 psc pp emulator in this case like 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.890
 always leave here down on the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.750
 description of the video the link so that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.279
 go and download it in this case 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.860
 We are talking about Tekken 6 a great game 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.250
 for those who do not know what is psc pp 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.320
 is an emulator of then and leave this 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.340
 life and ton or if not remove it because if not 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.460
 then they copy me and I think I'm going to 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.629
 remove it is a psp emulator for what 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.030
 that is both android ios and mac pc and 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.309
 many many many many many good 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.530
 more but yes other devices like 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.870
 symbian and others that I do not know but 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.399
 good in this case is compatible is 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.860
 made them burkina if they are video with 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.230
 all the other games at the moment you see 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.850
 wrong or it gets a little fuzzy us 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.670
 spit this just happens in this 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.410
 menu but already after we're playing 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.330
 they will usually see how everything changes 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.880
 let's go an arcade game really 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.880
 I've tried neither galaxy s 4.000 runs 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.680
 approximately maximum at 20 fps is like this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840
 how good is a little playable and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.060
 he prefers his best team because more and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.230
 better in this case than the precise ones 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.800
 let's go to this one 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.690
 a long time that I did not play simply 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.940
 is for them to see how it is 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 play if not, if you do not know 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.420
 How is it that you really tekken? 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.180
 well here you can see how they have 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.860
 some very good graphics although this 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.910
 because it depends on how I go 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.950
 running the cell phone today the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.690
 configuration that you have what exists 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.420
 it's a little heavy it's not very kind 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.670
 doing cell phone but good can 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.940
 open up with perfect very good otherwise 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.740
 what I love about psc pp is that you can 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.690
 connect any control in this case 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.330
 I'm in control of the xbox one what 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.670
 which is very good but really great 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.200
 that is, all buttons work and youtube 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 and configure anything just connect it 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.780
 and it's just already going as well as you can see 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.890
 here we win and it goes very well even though 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.530
 can see that some cuts there is a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.030
 little side but hey I'm not 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 saying the same thing or this can be 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.000
 use it on both android ios mac windows 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.260
 everything else works this file that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.260
 it's a decision with everything else 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 but nothing else is an extra because good 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.920
 if you do not know how to download the file 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 If you do not know how the games are played 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.000
 here in the description of the video 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.280
 I'm leaving the links so that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.900
 watch the videos even though it's truly 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.340
 very easy as the games go by 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 it's just that the file is a 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.970
 file only the cob to the new 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.130
 cell you move current then to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.900
 device that what is playing in it is 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.770
 a menu in this case is running a 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.020
 pc are going to load it but then 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.790
 Well they will open the menu so that 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.320
 they are choosing where they will want to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.570
 its file not in this case as I'm already 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.220
 here it's going to look like this you see going to 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.800
 games and here I'm going to go down until 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.200
 Say external memory or where they have then 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.760
 the file does not already execute it and it's going to 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.800
 leave this here so that afterwards no longer 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.840
 have you doing the same and just 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.540
 they click on it and they can see how we 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.430
 send again here I really love 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.650
 a lot of the game I recommend it a lot 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.410
 but good the bad thing that I did and I give myself 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700
 mind that it is not a game so 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.460
 compatible as what are the dragon 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.350
 ball so it 's associated powerful medium 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.910
 to be able to load it perfectly and 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.520
 this is a person who does not read 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.300
 both fluency if you settle for ones 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.680
 20 fps 18 12 well it is not necessary 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.260
 have a cell phone not so much 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.840
 powerful but let's see nothing else 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.940
 heading for them to see so 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.860
 I read it was very complete I do not know that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.050
 this is very complete this game be 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.910
 has minigames have levels you can 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.470
 unlock things and so on and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.930
 graphics look very good 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.310
 extremely well let's see how 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.459
 go here 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.030
 I'm like this as it was called no 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.030
 I remember very well 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.980
 it really looks super good but hey 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.840
 every time I keep repeating here because 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.159
 then they forget that here in the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.750
 description of the video so much I leave you the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.400
 link of the game so much I leave you the videos 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.410
 so they know how games are played 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.419
 or like torrents are downloaded 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.100
 because it's not an indirect because it's always 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.560
 they delete them but it is for a torrent 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.120
 but well I think that we're going 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.180
 to leave today's video guys 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.430
 I would like that in the comments then 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.020
 tell me that everyone wants to see and if it is 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.570
 they like it if they like it 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.190
 that videos put them like this or that 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.930
 serious because the cell directly 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.699
 but for me it's easier and more comfortable 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.710
 well in addition to the quality I feel that 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.650
 it's better in quotes not but good 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.720
 guys, here I say goodbye and see you 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.720
 in the next video we'll see you
