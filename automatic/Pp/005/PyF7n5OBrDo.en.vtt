okay<00:00:07.310> let<00:00:07.460> me<00:00:07.520> give<00:00:07.640> you<00:00:07.700> a<00:00:07.760> quick<00:00:07.970> demo<00:00:08.210> of

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
okay let me give you a quick demo of

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.690 
okay let me give you a quick demo of
type

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
type

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.600 
type
shift<00:00:10.150> and<00:00:10.840> at<00:00:11.290> the<00:00:11.380> end<00:00:11.500> of<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:11.679> demo<00:00:11.950> we'll

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
shift and at the end of the demo we'll

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.210 
shift and at the end of the demo we'll
look<00:00:12.910> to

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
look to

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.710 
look to
we<00:00:14.640> can<00:00:14.790> get<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:15.210> device<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
we can get out of the device in the

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.600 
we can get out of the device in the
typing<00:00:16.080> mode<00:00:16.200> so<00:00:16.380> I<00:00:16.410> got<00:00:16.560> Wi-Fi<00:00:16.740> off<00:00:17.100> I've<00:00:17.550> got

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
typing mode so I got Wi-Fi off I've got

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.900 
typing mode so I got Wi-Fi off I've got
a<00:00:17.760> screen<00:00:18.090> set<00:00:18.420> fairly<00:00:18.810> low<00:00:18.980> CPU<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.250> balance

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
a screen set fairly low CPU in balance

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.060 
a screen set fairly low CPU in balance
mode<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:23.330> is<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:25.320> test<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:29.360> keyboard

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
mode so this is a test of the keyboard

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:40.370 
mode so this is a test of the keyboard
it's<00:00:32.960> difficult<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> after<00:00:37.220> only<00:00:38.930> one<00:00:39.930> day

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
it's difficult but after only one day

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's difficult but after only one day
I'm<00:00:41.120> typing<00:00:42.950> fairly<00:00:44.390> fast<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.810> good<00:00:48.810> enough

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
I'm typing fairly fast it's good enough

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
I'm typing fairly fast it's good enough
for<00:00:50.060> emails<00:00:51.060> and<00:00:52.280> for<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:54.270> short<00:00:56.090> blogging

the demo let's let's look at the battery

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
the demo let's let's look at the battery
life<00:01:53.570> okay<00:01:54.570> I've<00:01:54.720> been<00:01:54.750> monitoring<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
life okay I've been monitoring the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
life okay I've been monitoring the
battery<00:01:55.650> life<00:01:55.799> while<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.010> do<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
battery life while I do that and it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.140 
battery life while I do that and it's
been<00:01:57.390> averaging<00:01:57.600> about<00:01:58.340> 6.8<00:01:59.340> Watts<00:01:59.790> drain

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
been averaging about 6.8 Watts drain

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.130 
been averaging about 6.8 Watts drain
which<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.840> good<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.000> 6.8<00:02:03.000> Watts<00:02:03.330> will

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
which is really good and 6.8 Watts will

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100 
which is really good and 6.8 Watts will
bring<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.650> about<00:02:04.799> two<00:02:05.040> hours<00:02:05.190> 45<00:02:06.060> minutes<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
bring you about two hours 45 minutes of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.979 
bring you about two hours 45 minutes of
battery<00:02:07.530> life<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.399> full<00:02:08.700> battery<00:02:08.909> and<00:02:09.780> here

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
battery life on a full battery and here

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.750 
battery life on a full battery and here
I'm<00:02:10.140> showing<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.560> us<00:02:10.590> 36<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.459> 82%<00:02:12.379> free<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:14.159> as<00:02:14.700> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
I'm showing to us 36 on 82% free so as a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.530 
I'm showing to us 36 on 82% free so as a
typing<00:02:15.330> device<00:02:15.709> just<00:02:16.709> inputting<00:02:17.370> text<00:02:17.610> two

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.870 

so<00:02:24.560> let's<00:02:24.709> go<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.130> other<00:02:25.250> end<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
so let's go to the other end of the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.309 
so let's go to the other end of the
scale<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.660> we'll<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:27.050> video<00:02:28.480> we'll<00:02:29.480> run<00:02:30.290> some

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
scale and we'll do video we'll run some

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.260 
scale and we'll do video we'll run some
Windows<00:02:30.830> Media<00:02:31.040> videos<00:02:31.520> on<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.970> Windows

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
Windows Media videos on the Windows

Windows Media videos on the Windows
Media<00:02:32.450> Player<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:35.080> again<00:02:36.080> I'm<00:02:36.200> measuring<00:02:36.410> me

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
Media Player and again I'm measuring me

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.000 
Media Player and again I'm measuring me
battery<00:02:37.400> life<00:02:37.550> while<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.970> happens<00:02:39.010> we'll

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
battery life while this happens we'll

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.360 
battery life while this happens we'll
give<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.330> about<00:02:41.330> 30<00:02:41.630> seconds<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.190> we'll

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
give it about 30 seconds and then we'll

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.770 
give it about 30 seconds and then we'll
have<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.489> look<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.760> see<00:02:43.849> what<00:02:43.970> color<00:02:44.150> look<00:02:44.660> is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
have a look to see what color look is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.720 
have a look to see what color look is
happening<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.200> battery<00:02:45.530> life<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:46.040> fact<00:02:46.280> if

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
happening in the battery life in fact if

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.059 
happening in the battery life in fact if
I<00:02:46.910> look<00:02:47.120> now<00:02:47.330> but<00:02:48.319> already<00:02:48.620> see<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
I look now but already see that the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.759 
I look now but already see that the
battery<00:02:49.330> usage<00:02:50.330> has<00:02:50.480> dropped<00:02:50.750> has<00:02:51.140> jumped<00:02:51.590> up

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
battery usage has dropped has jumped up

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.509 
battery usage has dropped has jumped up
from<00:02:51.830> 7<00:02:52.670> watts<00:02:52.910> through<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.870> 12<00:02:54.470> volts<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
from 7 watts through to 12 volts so the

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.340 
from 7 watts through to 12 volts so the
CPU<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.150> balanced<00:02:59.600> motors<00:02:59.870> probably<00:03:00.200> running

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
now running at I have 800 megahertz and

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.380 
now running at I have 800 megahertz and
the<00:03:04.310> utilization<00:03:04.670> we<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.569> check<00:03:05.810> as<00:03:05.989> well<00:03:07.390> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the utilization we can check as well the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.220 
the utilization we can check as well the
CPU<00:03:10.120> expect<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.360> be<00:03:11.390> fairly<00:03:11.690> high<00:03:11.810> around

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
CPU expect that to be fairly high around

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.160 
CPU expect that to be fairly high around
70<00:03:12.440> 80<00:03:12.739> %<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:14.180> fact<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:15.110> looking<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
70 80 % in fact it's looking like the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.050 
70 80 % in fact it's looking like the
videos<00:03:18.470> run<00:03:18.709> out<00:03:18.860> let's<00:03:19.069> play<00:03:19.280> again

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.960 

what's<00:03:23.060> running<00:03:23.239> at<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> hundred<00:03:23.720> percent<00:03:24.970> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
what's running at a hundred percent so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.400 
what's running at a hundred percent so
this<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.269> actually<00:03:26.690> very<00:03:26.720> close<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.380> a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
this is actually very close to a
