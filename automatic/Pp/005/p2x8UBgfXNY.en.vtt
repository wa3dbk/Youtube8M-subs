00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.400
 and then beauty people play for the cup of 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.349
 computer with another super test to 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.719
 Youtube channel 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.330
 today we are going to test the processors and 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:22.010
 3 and 5 and 7 due to many requests to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.860
 people with many clients with doubts 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.869
 friends with doubts and dokic would be more 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.330
 more importantly someone who invest 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.870
 what to do with our test bench today 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.350
 will be the source for sérgio s500 a 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.850
 motherboard asus p 8h my an agent 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.649
 got the motherboard simpler not to 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.809
 cause doubt that performance is 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.940
 being slightly larger due to the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.129
 motherboard then we used it with mom 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 simple input but supports 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.379
 quietly configuration of your 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.049
 tests 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.409
 a gtx 660 tiago video card and 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.719
 Watching your power and beer is better than 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.929
 the world's video card brand 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.239
 so let's go and use the 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.449
 North planting must have is to have a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.190
 benchmarking benko well fixed complete one 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.680
 easy thing for us to get a 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 Final media 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.430
 I'll show you the setting the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.340
 People are going to test 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.350
 I'm going to ride a little and see you. 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.900
 I'm going to cut the recording so I do not get a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.900
 test far away is a video of 20 and 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:35.780
 30 minutes always his head is fine 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:38.450
 of the full hd 1920 to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.740
 x I'm not going to test e - why the board 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.150
 supports 32 x then vote at maximum 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 no other step or medium long the king 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.570
 then everything will invest marktest at 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.480
 Leave the andre filming a little to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.340
 You see the average that we are going 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.620
 cut the recording soon 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.940
 the test and return with the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.940
 final average for you 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:12.230
 remembering that we are thinking the 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.480
 i3 21 24 processor and left 600 and 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.100
 theater 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.710
 So, guys, we're back with the final test of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.340
 i 3668 you can see there was one 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.410
 average of 64 point new frei miss lost 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.510
 planet in that configuration I showed it to 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.260
 You initially to everything at 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.270
 maximum 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.940
 now I'll get a replacement and three 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.420
 by mi5 then coming back and the test to 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420
 you soon 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.200
 Personal'm back with the test're 25 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.630
 15 34 50 gtx 660 and all the same 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.170
 configuration set to three and got 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.630
 in the average of 66 points five fronts 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.840
 giving only 23 more with three now I 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.680
 I will put the 2600k i7 processor and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 do the test again just lay around in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 Back to the crowd I'll have the 7 test. 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 Let's see how it was then, the people. 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 tested the 72,600 kaká gtx 660 as 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.610
 you could see that it was in the mean of 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.110
 69 Section 8 happy the guys we tested 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.910
 with the same configuration as the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.520
 default setting from the beginning in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.580
 all processors and 13 5 all the same 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.070
 Ok, then I'll give you the conclusion and the tip. 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.790
 Leave the dock for you, you could see 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:33.690
 was the average of 235 the two to three awards 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.330
 of 57 also then the tip gets put 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.860
 in 5 a video card more top to the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.200
 instead of putting the aesthetic off 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 that the real 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.180
 performance requires no more than 5 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.790
 the games today she wants it 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.640
 each of them to a gameplay will win the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.620
 question of khedi one minute with 17 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.320
 while with and silva then lost in the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.880
 video of the joint an example with e 7 6 10 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.130
 minutes will make 11 or 12 for $ 250 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.260
 more companies get compensated denied 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.750
 So I know if you think this 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.410
 processor i3 i5 and i7 has a difference 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.240
 brutal dantesca for example f3 or 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.920
 some other game leaves the tip for us 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.890
 what are we going to do for you guys? 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.570
 Brief is on and that's it guys three 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.630
 suggestions we are attending all 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.260
 Impossible and that's a hug.
