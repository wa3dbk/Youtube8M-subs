00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
they're a clear fast as well and so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
they're a clear fast as well and so
let's<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> execute

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
let's get let's get to how to execute

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.730 
let's get let's get to how to execute
this<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.810> after<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this and then after that I'm going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280 
this and then after that I'm going to
show<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.920> some<00:01:26.220> gameplay<00:01:26.930> footage<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> how

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
show you some gameplay footage of how

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
show you some gameplay footage of how
deadly<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> especially<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
deadly it really is especially in the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
deadly it really is especially in the
games<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.630> even<00:01:30.840> more<00:01:31.020> deadly<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.560> this

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
games it's even more deadly because this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
games it's even more deadly because this
seems<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> defenders<00:01:33.119> fall<00:01:33.360> over

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
seems like the defenders fall over

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.969 
seems like the defenders fall over
themselves<00:01:33.780> even<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.500> than<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.770> practice

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
themselves even more than in practice

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
themselves even more than in practice
mode<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mode and so so what you want to do is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
mode and so so what you want to do is
put<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.290> outside<00:01:40.799> receiver<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> fade<00:01:42.090> route

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
put the outside receiver on a fade route

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.149 
put the outside receiver on a fade route
and<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.020> he<00:01:43.079> gets<00:01:43.229> 20<00:01:43.560> yards<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> field

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and when he gets 20 yards down the field

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.630 
and when he gets 20 yards down the field
or<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.020> you're<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.619> throw<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> bullet

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
or so you're going to throw a bullet

the only thing that you got to worry
about<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.940> overthrows<00:02:39.420> by

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
about with this is the overthrows by

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.180 
about with this is the overthrows by
quarterbacks<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.349> be<00:02:40.440> overthrows<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.129> they

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
quarterbacks to be overthrows and they

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.830 
quarterbacks to be overthrows and they
have<00:02:41.280> safety<00:02:41.730> oh<00:02:41.879> there<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.239> will<00:02:42.450> get<00:02:42.660> picked

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
have safety oh there it will get picked

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.420 
have safety oh there it will get picked
off<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.769> that's<00:02:43.860> why<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.099> need<00:02:44.250> your

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
off so that's why you need your

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.880 
off so that's why you need your
quarterback<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:44.970> pretty<00:02:45.180> accurate<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:46.410> I

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
quarterback to be pretty accurate and I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.350 
quarterback to be pretty accurate and I
think<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> better<00:02:47.549> technique<00:02:48.030> than

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
think this is a better technique than

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.979 
think this is a better technique than
you<00:02:48.660> know

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
you know

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.720 
you know
