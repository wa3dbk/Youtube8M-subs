another weapon showcase this time I am

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.939 
another weapon showcase this time I am

using the sacred chime hammer which you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.089 
using the sacred chime hammer which you
can<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.250> by<00:00:29.730> giving<00:00:30.689> me<00:00:30.840> solo<00:00:31.109> velstadt<00:00:31.529> to

one<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> blacksmiths<00:00:33.570> now<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:35.340> weapon

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
one of the blacksmiths now this weapon

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.299 
one of the blacksmiths now this weapon
is<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.290> terribly<00:00:37.890> often

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is one that we don't see terribly often

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
is one that we don't see terribly often
and<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:39.329> slightly<00:00:39.780> surprising

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and that's slightly surprising

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.610 
and that's slightly surprising
considering<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:41.070> high<00:00:41.989> of<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> damage<00:00:43.440> output

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
considering how high of a damage output

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
considering how high of a damage output
this<00:00:43.950> thing<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this thing can have but more on that a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.170 
this thing can have but more on that a
little<00:00:46.170> bit<00:00:46.320> later<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.670> getting<00:00:47.670> started<00:00:48.059> with

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
little bit later on getting started with

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.350 
little bit later on getting started with
the<00:00:48.300> weapon<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:49.140> requires<00:00:49.500> 40<00:00:50.309> strengths<00:00:50.670> 12

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
150 for me the attack rating of this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
150 for me the attack rating of this
weapon<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.960> 774<00:01:09.960> withering<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.070> blades<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
weapon is 774 withering of blades the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.740 
weapon is 774 withering of blades the
counter<00:01:12.510> strength<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.040> 100<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.790> poise<00:01:15.330> damage

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
counter strength is 100 the poise damage

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.219 
counter strength is 100 the poise damage
is<00:01:15.960> 60<00:01:16.530> per<00:01:16.740> hit<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.670> weight<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.030> 22<00:01:18.720> units

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
is 60 per hit and the weight is 22 units

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
is 60 per hit and the weight is 22 units
now<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.880> am<00:01:21.119> using<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.509> dark

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
now as you can see I am using a dark

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
now as you can see I am using a dark
infused<00:01:22.200> version<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> weapon<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.280> these

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
infused version of the weapon for these

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
infused version of the weapon for these
fights<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.259> honestly<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> makes

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
fights and honestly that just makes

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.789 
fights and honestly that just makes
sense<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.460> most<00:01:26.759> cases<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.110> pretty

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
sense in most cases because it's pretty

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.240 
sense in most cases because it's pretty
much<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.430> straight<00:01:29.820> upgrade<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
much just a straight upgrade the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
much just a straight upgrade the
confusion<00:01:32.250> changes<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.150> scaling<00:01:33.450> slightly

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
confusion changes your scaling slightly

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
confusion changes your scaling slightly
so<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.650> B<00:01:35.460> scaling<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.000> strength<00:01:36.299> drops

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so your B scaling and strength drops

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.710 
so your B scaling and strength drops
down<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.200> lower<00:01:37.530> tier<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.070> V<00:01:38.280> scaling<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:39.329> B

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
down to a lower tier of V scaling your B

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
down to a lower tier of V scaling your B
scallion<00:01:40.200> dark<00:01:40.470> upgrades<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.210> dark

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
scallion dark upgrades to an a and dark

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.499 
scallion dark upgrades to an a and dark
the<00:01:43.470> physical<00:01:43.829> based<00:01:44.040> damage<00:01:44.700> drops<00:01:45.149> down<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the physical based damage drops down to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
the physical based damage drops down to
a<00:01:46.250> 364<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.579> 380<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.439> dark<00:01:49.829> base<00:01:50.100> goes<00:01:50.520> up

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a 364 from 380 and the dark base goes up

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
a 364 from 380 and the dark base goes up
to<00:01:51.320> 215<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:53.299> 150<00:01:54.500> altogether<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.799> damage

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
to 215 from 150 altogether my damage

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.030 
to 215 from 150 altogether my damage
output<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:57.119> attack<00:01:57.450> rating<00:01:57.719> rather<00:01:58.040> increased

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
output my attack rating rather increased

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.590 
output my attack rating rather increased
from<00:01:59.780> 774<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:02.090> 843<00:02:03.110> by<00:02:04.110> infusing<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:04.920> dark

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
from 774 to 843 by infusing it with dark

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.020 
from 774 to 843 by infusing it with dark
so<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:08.099> significant<00:02:08.789> increase

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so that's a pretty significant increase

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
so that's a pretty significant increase
and<00:02:09.569> if<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> buff<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.649> top<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and if I was to buff on top of that it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
and if I was to buff on top of that it
would<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.670> even<00:02:11.940> more<00:02:12.150> significant<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.230> terms

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
would be even more significant in terms

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.479 
would be even more significant in terms
of<00:02:13.739> my<00:02:13.980> damage<00:02:14.580> output<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.870> there's<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.650> now

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
of my damage output so there's that now

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.640 
of my damage output so there's that now
the<00:02:17.849> biggest<00:02:18.030> Pro<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.569> weapon<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:18.989> I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the biggest Pro of the weapon as I'm

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.460 
the biggest Pro of the weapon as I'm
sure<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.010> already<00:02:20.459> tell<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:21.140> damage<00:02:22.140> the

sure you can already tell is damage the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.280 
sure you can already tell is damage the
damage<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.569> kind<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.690> crazy<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
damage on this thing is kind of crazy I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.199 
damage on this thing is kind of crazy I
mean<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> weapon<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.370> breaks<00:02:26.730> 800

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
mean it's a weapon that breaks 800

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.540 
mean it's a weapon that breaks 800
attack<00:02:27.480> rating<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.050> that's<00:02:28.709> saying<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.520> lot

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
attack rating and that's saying a lot

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.309 
attack rating and that's saying a lot
there<00:02:29.940> are<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.269> few<00:02:30.480> weapons<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.140> that

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
there are very few weapons that do that

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.550 
there are very few weapons that do that
so<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:31.860> kind<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.370> big<00:02:32.489> deal<00:02:33.110> other<00:02:34.110> pros

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
so that's kind of a big deal other pros

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
so that's kind of a big deal other pros
of<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> weapon<00:02:35.160> you've<00:02:35.670> got<00:02:35.849> your<00:02:35.970> combos<00:02:36.480> as

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of the weapon you've got your combos as

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.530 
of the weapon you've got your combos as
far<00:02:37.349> as<00:02:37.650> your<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.819> using<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
far as your you know using the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
far as your you know using the
two-handed<00:02:40.470> r2<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.040> then<00:02:41.160> running<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:42.060> a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
two-handed r2 and then running in with a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
two-handed r2 and then running in with a
running<00:02:42.420> attack<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.930> hitting<00:02:43.110> someone<00:02:43.290> well

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
running attack and hitting someone well

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
running attack and hitting someone well
both<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.069> those<00:02:44.190> things<00:02:44.430> happen<00:02:44.700> really

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
both of those things happen really

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.650 
both of those things happen really
satisfying<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.620> two-handed<00:02:47.660> Artoo's

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
satisfying if the two-handed Artoo's

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.229 
satisfying if the two-handed Artoo's
orbs<00:02:49.319> break<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> person's<00:02:50.519> guard<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.090> you

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
orbs break the person's guard and you

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.240 
orbs break the person's guard and you
smack<00:02:51.510> them<00:02:51.690> down<00:02:51.959> with<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:52.920> that's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
smack them down with it that's that's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
smack them down with it that's that's
just<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:54.090> satisfying<00:02:54.390> thing<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.110> in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
just a really satisfying thing to do in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.110 
just a really satisfying thing to do in
my<00:02:55.410> opinion<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:57.260> other<00:02:58.260> than<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.120> mean

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
my opinion but other than that I mean

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.860 
my opinion but other than that I mean
you've<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.080> your<00:03:01.519> style<00:03:02.519> points<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.180> guess<00:03:03.420> for

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
you've got your style points I guess for

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.899 
you've got your style points I guess for
using<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.739> two-handed<00:03:05.159> r2<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> mean<00:03:05.700> come<00:03:05.879> on

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
using the two-handed r2 I mean come on

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.850 
using the two-handed r2 I mean come on
that's<00:03:06.060> that's<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.510> cool<00:03:06.659> attack<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.590> tracking

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
that's that's a cool attack the tracking

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's that's a cool attack the tracking
ad<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.190> kind<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.519> sucks<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.739> really

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
ad it kind of sucks but it can be really

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.699 
ad it kind of sucks but it can be really
useful<00:03:10.980> at<00:03:11.310> times<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.450> that's<00:03:13.170> my<00:03:13.379> take<00:03:13.560> on

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
useful at times so that's my take on

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.610 
useful at times so that's my take on
that<00:03:13.769> now<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.819> cons<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> weapon<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.080> would

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that now the cons of the weapon I would

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.710 
that now the cons of the weapon I would
say<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.250> biggest<00:03:17.550> con<00:03:17.909> would<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
say that the biggest con would be the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.570 
say that the biggest con would be the
weight<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.530> not<00:03:19.739> as<00:03:19.890> heavy<00:03:20.069> as<00:03:20.159> say<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
weight it's not as heavy as say the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.869 
weight it's not as heavy as say the
crypt<00:03:21.030> black<00:03:21.390> sword<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.340> that's<00:03:23.340> all<00:03:23.640> well

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
crypt black sword and that's all well

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.660 
crypt black sword and that's all well
and<00:03:23.909> good<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> still<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:25.129> 22<00:03:26.129> units<00:03:26.549> of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and good but it still is 22 units of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.670 
and good but it still is 22 units of
weight<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.629> lot<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.810> builds<00:03:28.110> can't<00:03:28.319> handle

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
weight and a lot of builds can't handle

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.180 
weight and a lot of builds can't handle
that<00:03:28.799> easily<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.400> there's<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.629> other<00:03:31.319> cons<00:03:31.860> I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that easily so there's that other cons I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.160 
that easily so there's that other cons I
would<00:03:32.310> say<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:33.299> like<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> crypt<00:03:33.900> black

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
would say just like the crypt black

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.750 
would say just like the crypt black
sword<00:03:34.470> you've<00:03:34.650> got<00:03:34.799> your<00:03:34.890> stamina<00:03:35.129> drain

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
sword you've got your stamina drain

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.850 
sword you've got your stamina drain
you<00:03:36.060> got<00:03:36.239> your<00:03:36.360> slow<00:03:36.599> tracking<00:03:37.049> speed<00:03:37.319> it's

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
you got your slow tracking speed it's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.839 
you got your slow tracking speed it's
easy<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.400> dodge<00:03:38.549> as<00:03:38.909> such<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:40.190> on<00:03:41.190> top<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.670> that

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
easy to dodge as such and on top of that

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.500 
easy to dodge as such and on top of that
it<00:03:42.750> doesn't<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.860> many<00:03:44.390> comparison<00:03:45.390> in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
it doesn't have as many comparison in

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.729 
it doesn't have as many comparison in
comparison<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.110> Crypt<00:03:46.260> blacks<00:03:46.530> where

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
comparison with the Crypt blacks where

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.199 
comparison with the Crypt blacks where
this<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.370> doesn't<00:03:47.610> have<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:47.909> many

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
this is it doesn't have as many

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.710 
this is it doesn't have as many
guaranteed<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.200> hit<00:03:49.580> combos<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.330> can't

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
guaranteed to hit combos so you can't

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.199 
guaranteed to hit combos so you can't
really<00:03:51.870> do<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> two-handed<00:03:52.830> r1<00:03:53.340> into<00:03:53.970> a

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
really do a two-handed r1 into a

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.960 
really do a two-handed r1 into a
two-handed<00:03:54.780> r1<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.860> person<00:03:56.189> that<00:03:56.310> has<00:03:56.580> enough

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
two-handed r1 the person that has enough

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.640 
two-handed r1 the person that has enough
time<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.269> roll<00:03:57.629> out<00:03:57.659> because<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.260> takes<00:03:58.439> so

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
time to roll out because it takes so

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.860 
time to roll out because it takes so
long<00:03:58.920> now<00:03:59.849> that<00:04:00.030> being<00:04:00.239> said<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.569> haven't

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
long now that being said I haven't

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.360 
long now that being said I haven't
tested<00:04:01.080> with<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.439> stone<00:04:01.769> ring<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.129> see<00:04:02.280> if

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
tested with the stone ring to see if

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.309 
tested with the stone ring to see if
that<00:04:02.549> stun<00:04:03.120> duration<00:04:03.269> has<00:04:03.599> increased<00:04:04.049> long

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
that stun duration has increased long

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.020 
that stun duration has increased long
enough<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> actually<00:04:04.920> manage<00:04:05.549> lending<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
enough to actually manage lending a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.259 
enough to actually manage lending a
second<00:04:06.390> r1<00:04:06.900> tech<00:04:07.170> but<00:04:08.099> from<00:04:08.580> my<00:04:08.730> experience

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
second r1 tech but from my experience

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.630 
second r1 tech but from my experience
with<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.450> as<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.989> was<00:04:10.640> no<00:04:11.640> such<00:04:11.879> luck

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
with it as it was no such luck

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.810 
with it as it was no such luck
so<00:04:13.180> that's<00:04:13.600> that<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.950> other<00:04:15.100> Pro<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.610> did

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
so that's that one other Pro that I did

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.729 
so that's that one other Pro that I did

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
forget to mention this thing will eat

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.050
