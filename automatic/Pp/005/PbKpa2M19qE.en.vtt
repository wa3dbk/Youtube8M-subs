understand<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> reason<00:02:10.709> why<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.340> knows

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
understand the reason why all it knows

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.369 
understand the reason why all it knows
is<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.629> with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.870> people<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
is is that it's not with the people it

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.940 
is is that it's not with the people it
loves<00:02:13.620> in

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
guess being the pastor initially three

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.970 
guess being the pastor initially three
weeks<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.450> age<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:19.530> they're<00:02:19.709> fully

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
weeks of age but when they're fully

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.490 
weeks of age but when they're fully
grown<00:02:20.099> they<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:21.000> be<00:02:21.090> even<00:02:21.420> bigger<00:02:21.660> than<00:02:21.840> cutie

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
grown they can be even bigger than cutie

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.710 
grown they can be even bigger than cutie

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
right here so you can't just buy them

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
right here so you can't just buy them
because<00:02:25.050> they<00:02:25.200> are<00:02:25.260> cute<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> tiny<00:02:25.980> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
because they are cute and tiny to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.280
