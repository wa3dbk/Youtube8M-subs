00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello of welcome to a new video of 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.099
 Nautical x jones this time we're going 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.750
 to teach how we have restored a jet 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.030
 mart 1 gm 10 as you can see the engine 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.670
 is pretty bad condition especially in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.590
 the crankcase area and the water pump already 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.110
 that there is usually a lot of humidity in that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.210
 zone 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.100
 The first thing we are going to do is take out the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.390
 boat engine to be able 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.940
 clean it accept once clean the cen 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.310
 What we will do is scratch the 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 engine especially the most rusty parts 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.989
 where the paint has skipped once 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.970
 scraping well-oiled the engine is 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.079
 passes the epoxy primer and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.940
 then we paint it with paint 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.480
 as you can see in the images the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 finish is perfect seems to be a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.950
 totally new engine once with the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 already prepared engine we will return to 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:21.390
 ride on the boat to check 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:23.190
 everything works correctly once 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.250
 the motor already assembled and with the boat 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:39.180
 clean let's put in the water to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:41.729
 make the last new once all 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.250
 checked and we see that everything works 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.080
 perfectly we can leave the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.080
 boat ready to sail
