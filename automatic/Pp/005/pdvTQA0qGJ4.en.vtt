00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
you set the step down you should be able

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.170 
you set the step down you should be able
to<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:37.960> no<00:01:38.170> problem<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:39.760> here's<00:01:39.940> what<00:01:40.090> it

looks<00:01:40.330> like<00:01:40.450> again

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.340 

another<00:01:52.010> tip<00:01:52.360> after<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.689> do<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.900> monkey<00:01:54.020> ball

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
another tip after you do the monkey ball

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.770 
another tip after you do the monkey ball
try<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.950> land<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.189> your<00:01:55.340> one<00:01:55.490> foot<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.570> can

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
try to land on your one foot so you can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.620 
try to land on your one foot so you can

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.610 

that's<00:02:02.630> how<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:02.960> do<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> monkey<00:02:03.350> ball<00:02:03.680> piece
