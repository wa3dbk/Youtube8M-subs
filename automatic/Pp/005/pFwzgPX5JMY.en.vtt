00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
going to be called lark zombies the idea

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
going to be called lark zombies the idea
of<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.100> mimic<00:00:23.490> an

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of this is that it is going to mimic an

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
of this is that it is going to mimic an
infected<00:00:24.150> /<00:00:24.359> zombies<00:00:24.630> type<00:00:25.080> game<00:00:25.320> mode<00:00:25.529> the

infected / zombies type game mode the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.250 
infected / zombies type game mode the
kind<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> ones<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.090> Halo<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.750> in

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
kind of ones you can see in Halo or in

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
kind of ones you can see in Halo or in
call<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> duty<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.390> because<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.599> know<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
call of duty and because you know that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.620 
call of duty and because you know that
conduit<00:00:31.920> doesn't<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.460> its<00:00:32.669> own<00:00:32.759> version<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
conduit doesn't have its own version it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
conduit doesn't have its own version it
does<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:33.989> balloon<00:00:34.260> battle<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.800> again<00:00:35.010> who

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
does have balloon battle but again who

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.799 
does have balloon battle but again who
really<00:00:35.850> wants<00:00:36.090> their<00:00:36.210> zombies<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
really wants their zombies to be

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.020 
really wants their zombies to be
exploding<00:00:38.030> midgets<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.590> thing

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
exploding midgets so that's one thing

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
exploding midgets so that's one thing
the<00:00:42.030> idea<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> typical<00:00:43.140> zombie<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the idea for a typical zombie is that it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
the idea for a typical zombie is that it
melees<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.450> system<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> built<00:00:46.200> ground

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
melees so this system was built ground

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.490 
melees so this system was built ground
up<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.700> order<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> basically<00:00:48.840> set<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> system

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
up in order to basically set up a system

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.779 
up in order to basically set up a system
where<00:00:49.820> almost<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.390> players<00:00:51.780> start<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
where almost all players start as a

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
where almost all players start as a
survivor<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> survivor<00:00:54.660> right

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
survivor and this is the survivor right

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.340 
survivor and this is the survivor right
here<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> trust<00:00:56.879> soldier<00:00:57.420> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
here it has to be a trust soldier so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.610 
here it has to be a trust soldier so
they're<00:00:58.649> easily<00:00:58.980> recognizable<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.789> human<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
they're easily recognizable as human and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.399 
they're easily recognizable as human and
they're<00:01:01.620> custom<00:01:02.129> model<00:01:02.879> should<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
they're custom model should have a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
they're custom model should have a
primary<00:01:04.830> color<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.240> three

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
primary color that is one of these three

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
primary color that is one of these three
colors<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:07.860> easily<00:01:08.070> recognized

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
colors so they can be easily recognized

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
colors so they can be easily recognized
as<00:01:08.939> blue<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> their<00:01:10.020> secondary<00:01:10.350> color<00:01:10.650> should

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
as blue and their secondary color should

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
as blue and their secondary color should
be<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.460> three<00:01:11.610> colors<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
be one of these three colors so the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
be one of these three colors so the
visor<00:01:12.780> color<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.619> easily<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> recognized<00:01:14.549> as

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
visor color can easily be recognized as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
visor color can easily be recognized as
blue<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.530> right

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
blue so this is the one I have right

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.660 
blue so this is the one I have right
here<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.210> there<00:01:18.210> loadout<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here I there loadout I know them going a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
here I there loadout I know them going a
bit<00:01:20.759> fast<00:01:20.909> guys<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> hold

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bit fast guys are going to have to hold

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
bit fast guys are going to have to hold
on<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.710> their<00:01:23.280> loadout<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.180> be

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
on for this their loadout can be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.560 
on for this their loadout can be
anything<00:01:24.720> except<00:01:25.560> two<00:01:25.860> things<00:01:26.570> loadout

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
anything except two things loadout

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.760 
anything except two things loadout
cannot<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> stealth<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.360> loadout

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
cannot have stealth and the loadout

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.710 
cannot have stealth and the loadout
cannot<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:32.070> ammo<00:01:32.430> salvage<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> idea<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
cannot have ammo salvage so the idea is

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
cannot have ammo salvage so the idea is
that<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.259> survivor<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.189> life<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.729> very

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that the survivor has one life and very

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
that the survivor has one life and very
limited<00:01:36.869> ammo<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.740> only<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.130> ammo<00:01:38.310> from

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
limited ammo that can only get ammo from

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
limited ammo that can only get ammo from
the<00:01:38.790> dead<00:01:38.970> corpses<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.420> zombies<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.280> from<00:01:41.280> dead

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the dead corpses of zombies or from dead

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.630 
the dead corpses of zombies or from dead
corpses<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> allies<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.869> died

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
corpses of allies that just died

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.590 
corpses of allies that just died
survivors<00:01:44.640> cannot<00:01:44.909> kill<00:01:45.090> each<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.360> in

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
survivors cannot kill each other in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
survivors cannot kill each other in
typical<00:01:45.990> game<00:01:46.110> mode<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.310> like

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
typical game mode but in kind of like

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.569 
typical game mode but in kind of like
hardcore<00:01:47.729> mode<00:01:48.259> survivors<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.710> kill<00:01:50.310> other

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
hardcore mode survivors can kill other

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
hardcore mode survivors can kill other
survivors<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.420> their<00:01:51.540> mo<00:01:51.810> although<00:01:52.350> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
survivors to take their mo although it's

cannot<00:03:46.290> use<00:03:46.620> stealth<00:03:47.510> that's<00:03:48.510> pretty<00:03:49.080> much<00:03:49.350> it

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
cannot use stealth that's pretty much it

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.920 
cannot use stealth that's pretty much it
guys<00:03:49.920> if<00:03:50.520> you<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.150> about<00:03:51.240> anything<00:03:51.630> being

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
guys if you think about anything being

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.260 
guys if you think about anything being
overpowered<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.920> really<00:03:53.460> can't<00:03:53.820> be<00:03:53.910> for

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
overpowered it really can't be for

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.300 
overpowered it really can't be for
example<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.930> thinking<00:03:55.170> about<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.530> if

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
example I was thinking about this if

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.520 
example I was thinking about this if
they<00:03:56.430> set<00:03:56.640> up<00:03:56.730> tpc<00:03:57.270> mines<00:03:57.540> eventually<00:03:58.290> they're

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
they set up tpc mines eventually they're

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.440 
they set up tpc mines eventually they're
going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.710> run<00:03:58.830> out<00:03:58.860> of<00:03:58.980> mines<00:03:59.310> if<00:04:00.270> they're

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
going to run out of mines if they're

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.060 
going to run out of mines if they're
using<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.720> Widowmaker<00:04:00.930> turret<00:04:01.410> once<00:04:01.920> that

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
using a Widowmaker turret once that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.100 
using a Widowmaker turret once that
Widowmaker<00:04:02.400> turret<00:04:02.700> goes<00:04:02.850> down<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.690> no

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
Widowmaker turret goes down they have no

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.690 
Widowmaker turret goes down they have no
primary<00:04:04.440> weapon<00:04:05.210> so<00:04:06.210> really<00:04:06.600> um<00:04:07.130> yeah<00:04:08.130> it's

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
primary weapon so really um yeah it's

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.420 
primary weapon so really um yeah it's
pretty<00:04:09.270> fair<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.959> believe<00:04:10.500> if<00:04:11.130> they're<00:04:11.340> using

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
pretty fair I believe if they're using

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.960 
pretty fair I believe if they're using
small<00:04:11.910> they<00:04:12.090> got<00:04:12.209> two<00:04:12.450> rockets<00:04:13.820> if<00:04:14.820> they're

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
small they got two rockets if they're

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.180 
small they got two rockets if they're
using<00:04:15.060> phase<00:04:15.660> rifle<00:04:16.109> they<00:04:16.260> got<00:04:16.440> very<00:04:16.709> limited

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
using phase rifle they got very limited

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.449 
using phase rifle they got very limited
ammo<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.170> pretty<00:04:19.410> much<00:04:19.709> fair<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.250> is

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
ammo so it's pretty much fair that is

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.610 
ammo so it's pretty much fair that is
the<00:04:20.640> game<00:04:20.940> mode<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:21.480> done<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.870> free<00:04:22.260> for<00:04:22.500> all

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the game mode it is done in free for all

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.830 
the game mode it is done in free for all
you<00:04:23.580> should<00:04:23.760> set<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.150> score<00:04:24.479> limit<00:04:24.750> to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
you should set this score limit to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.960 
you should set this score limit to
something<00:04:25.169> like<00:04:25.410> 20<00:04:26.160> or<00:04:26.280> 30

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
something like 20 or 30

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.060 
something like 20 or 30
um<00:04:27.110> because<00:04:28.110> people<00:04:28.590> aren't<00:04:28.710> really<00:04:28.890> going<00:04:28.980> to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
um because people aren't really going to

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.960 
um because people aren't really going to
be<00:04:29.130> killing<00:04:29.340> each<00:04:29.430> other<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.700> much<00:04:29.730> time

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
be killing each other that much time

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.600 
be killing each other that much time
focusing<00:04:30.330> on<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.540> game<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:32.100> time<00:04:32.310> limit

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
focusing on the game and the time limit

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.570 
focusing on the game and the time limit
should<00:04:32.760> be<00:04:33.420> set<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:34.440> don't<00:04:35.190> know<00:04:35.250> something

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
should be set to I don't know something

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.210 
should be set to I don't know something
like<00:04:35.730> 20<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.120> 30<00:04:36.330> minutes<00:04:36.510> as<00:04:36.720> well<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:38.040> should

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
like 20 to 30 minutes as well you should

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.400 
like 20 to 30 minutes as well you should
probably<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:38.790> end<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.180> game<00:04:39.360> once<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.110> last

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
probably just end the game once the last

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.890 
probably just end the game once the last
survivor<00:04:40.830> has<00:04:41.040> been<00:04:41.220> killed<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.420> at<00:04:42.720> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
survivor has been killed and at that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.330 
survivor has been killed and at that
point<00:04:43.110> it's<00:04:43.290> probably<00:04:43.410> just<00:04:43.680> easier<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.040> allow

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
point it's probably just easier to allow

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.240 
point it's probably just easier to allow
one<00:04:44.580> person<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:45.540> kill<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.110> rest<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:47.070> game

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
one person to kill the rest this game

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.420 
one person to kill the rest this game
