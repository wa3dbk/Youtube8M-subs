everything
you<00:04:49.570> can't<00:04:49.750> have<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.020> straight<00:04:50.289> honestly

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
you can't have it straight honestly

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.779 
you can't have it straight honestly
because<00:04:51.009> that<00:04:51.190> just<00:04:51.310> looks<00:04:51.550> ridiculous<00:04:52.060> so

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
because that just looks ridiculous so

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
friend so like a really thick bit like

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.550 
friend so like a really thick bit like
this<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.039> it<00:05:03.430> won't<00:05:03.610> be<00:05:03.729> too<00:05:03.759> curly<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.690> I

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
this so that it won't be too curly and I

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.550 
this so that it won't be too curly and I
like<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.070> brush<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.090> out<00:05:07.180> again<00:05:07.509> I<00:05:07.900> go<00:05:08.350> perhaps

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
like to brush it out again I go perhaps

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.939 
like to brush it out again I go perhaps
Brian<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.370> just<00:05:09.610> kind<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.320> do<00:05:11.320> this<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.919> I

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
Brian and I just kind of do this so I

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.850 
Brian and I just kind of do this so I
can<00:05:11.979> curl<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.460> up<00:05:12.699> with<00:05:13.060> like<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.930> not

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
can curl it up with like this and not

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.040 
can curl it up with like this and not
for<00:05:15.070> very<00:05:15.160> long<00:05:15.310> but<00:05:15.699> five<00:05:15.940> four<00:05:16.300> three<00:05:16.330> two

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
for very long but five four three two

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.140 
for very long but five four three two
one<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:20.169> then<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.710> brush<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.340> into<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.789> rat<00:05:21.970> so

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
one and then I brush it into the rat so

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.240 
one and then I brush it into the rat so
I<00:05:22.210> just<00:05:22.360> get<00:05:22.479> my<00:05:22.630> hand<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.800> go<00:05:23.949> like<00:05:24.070> this

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
I just get my hand and I go like this

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.700 
I just get my hand and I go like this
sometimes<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.090> takes<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.389> few<00:05:25.419> tries<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:26.470> get<00:05:26.620> it

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
sometimes it takes a few tries to get it

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.250 
sometimes it takes a few tries to get it
looking<00:05:26.860> right<00:05:27.160> at<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.460> moment<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:28.030> doesn't

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
looking right at the moment it doesn't

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.640
