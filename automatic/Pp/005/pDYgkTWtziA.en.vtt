00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 all beaver dear friends with you wendy and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 today we will talk about who 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.679
 looks like our nightmare it looks like 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.139
 you know several animatronics at once 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.960
 olive tees are essentially the same 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 there are all the baths except one but not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.029
 less it is 1 or more like another 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 less by 1 the other one is shorter 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 look means the first option 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 which we talk about immediately talk about 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 nightmare Freddy there are such theories that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.460
 he looks like a nightmare freddie but it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.800
 easy enough paw and with 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 then look first and win under 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 nickname means inside firstly here i am 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.350
 I say look here you can see that he has an ear 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.920
 fishing on here that's why here's a little 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 that I pass it is clear that the ear is a piece of a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.379
 You can also see that this ear is here 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 here she is at his here and so just like at 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.870
 Freddie 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 well that was evidence side 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 the fact that it is at the same Freddy Borg's 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.670
 so much so they are located under 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.330
 by the corner 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.549
 blowing again since here you can see the rift 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.790
 visible fault and here the analysis of the fault 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 obviously no well obviously because the ears 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.340
 stick out therefore this is the first proof 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.920
 in the direction that they are not the same 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.830
 further this is not here on the nose 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
 no hanging wires while 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.689
 this animatronic has hanging wires 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.030
 there is a second proof 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.490
 third proof let's see this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 animatronic fingers and only in his 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.189
 fingers here are these drills they are small 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.470
 only one part is visible here first 1 o 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.189
 abdomen is also here that is it him 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.189
 such a chip look here so much crap 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.100
 there is a lot of scope and Freddie in my 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.720
 there is even no such thing at all so I 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 I hope you have explained enough that 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 this is not spring Freddy i mean stop 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.299
 forget what you reveal later 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.189
 Experience tell forget about sprint 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.619
 Freddie doesn't look like the nightmarish freddie and 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.200
 there is still such a theory 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.190
 nightmares for some reason I do not fully understand 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.090
 but nightmares supposedly know how to transform into 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.580
 other animatronics change their shape 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.540
 no it's this stupid but because in 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.130
 first well 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.090
 have they can change their appearance 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.680
 then they would change their appearance in 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.790
 certain very prominent features 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.060
 let's say yes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.310
 would grow too and would change teeth on 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.930
 second row 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.940
 would change fingers for some reason I am not up 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.330
 fully understand but this would Fredy 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 there was no this detail which is not at all 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.070
 has nothing to do with the image and this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.410
 just lets us say this 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.600
 nightmare not reincarnated esprit freddy a 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.940
 it's just another animatronic real 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.950
 or unreal I really do n't know yet 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.140
 whether or not they are actually two theories 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.180
 there is, but I'll give you too later 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.430
 Incidentally, for a moment I will touch 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.460
 they say that the nightmarish freddie 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.770
 there are fredi ki little nightmares at that 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.220
 time like a pony for some reason 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.680
 there is no deprived little bath shami 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.800
 well no really not true because 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.320
 that here now I have already said here at 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.300
 two eyes and it is not just a reflection 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:20.720
 these are exactly two eyes closer and well 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.740
 apparently I do not know about here 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.650
 red. 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.450
 I'm obviously straight red. and so am I not 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.790
 I know you, but I personally see here 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.950
 here's the lens that's right that's where I put it 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.530
 red dot and see a lens here 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.230
 but too bad resolution therefore 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.170
 it's hard to say for sure but I personally believe in 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.810
 the fact that this here this eyes small 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.340
 either a nightmare to either understand 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.840
 compare it to someone springtrap 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.110
 They say that he looks like a springtrap well 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.230
 no firstly why not here 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.010
 Springtrap clearly shows the features of the chapter 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.209
 humanity eyes 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.180
 Well, it is logical because it sits 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.409
 the person is clearly visible at the same time 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.939
 that mechanical eye I think it already 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.459
 big enough proof but we 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.500
 don't dwell on this 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.549
 and the teeth are made as usual 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:21.010
 animatronic nightmare teeth terrible 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:23.139
 it is logical to continue looking at the nightmare 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.090
 ok while springtrap ear 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.639
 broken but of course they still have fingers 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 differ to the facts is not enough you all this 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.539
 can be reset to the fact that this is a nightmare and 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.000
 so u kane from when gtra turned into 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.729
 such a terrible rabbit we don't know in 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.350
 it still does not seem like legs 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.699
 itâ€™s not enough for you 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.430
 look at the eye at springtrap eye 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:48.520
 squeeze while at nightmare's 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.160
 the eye goes out and it doesn't just come out 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.710
 because he chooses and he comes out 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.389
 because here's if you corps was 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.360
 ok it would be a little bit anyway 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.120
 out of its orbit that's enough 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.130
 interesting but it is different from 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.520
 springtrap whose eyes are inserted 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.470
 so in many ways 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.289
 nightmarish blog is not with at to 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.440
 ladders but you have not considered one 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:18.280
 interesting version of old horses 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.310
 so we watch football as well as 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.550
 nightmare carnage moving ears and 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.660
 move not down up to also by the way 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.520
 saying that body 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.899
 but to say that it is that Bonnie 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.990
 I really won't 

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:35.389
 further we look where here two rows of teeth 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.029
 like any old animatronics and 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.669
 this fact sets him apart from the slaughter 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:45.979
 our nightmare two rows of teeth 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.399
 by the way he has one more row 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.059
 of teeth 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:52.099
 it's hard to see but he has water and 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:55.249
 him and this row of teeth 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.169
 he is in the dark maybe i'm not sure but 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.289
 scott tried to tell us that way 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.069
 what is the prototype of this animatronic these 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.749
 teeth are missing 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:10.279
 that's why i think that the prototype 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:11.899
 nightmarish carriage is a bolt god and this 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.179
 great on theory because 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:18.589
 the child who was bitten who sees 

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:20.990
 this nightmare was on a bite 87 and saw old 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:23.899
 animatronics maybe even they him 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.889
 bitten but I'm not sure about it and therefore 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:30.800
 his biggest nightmares look 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.169
 just like old animatronics by the way 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.899
 telling me here they made a picture 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.769
 looked like a dreadful bonny if he had 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.740
 there was no face 

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:42.949
 I really don't know about you, but I 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.019
 he is very similar I will still believe that 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.969
 it is a type 

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:49.430
 olbani by the way probably worth more 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:51.829
 explain on the topic of 5 fingers which are not 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.079
 obviously walt animatronics and act 

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:56.329
 our nightmare bath as I said 

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:59.089
 earlier it is most likely because 

00:06:56.329 --> 00:07:01.519
 our child has all the fantasies 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:03.110
 animatronic fingers appear by 5 

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:06.559
 because it is normal for a person 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.019
 she bite he just didn't pay attention 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:11.869
 On such details of course explanations troch 

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:14.089
 wound however having logic after all 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:15.949
 if the bitten didn't look at it then 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:17.990
 he could not have noticed that ordinary 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.490
 animatronics four fingers another 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.969
 option and I will tell you about it in detail 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.189
 still later there was spring bonnie with 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:27.189
 solder some springtrap and baby 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:28.270
 drawing attention to his 5 fingers 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.010
 realize 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.560
 and added five fingers to the rest 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.020
 animatronic but again it is 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.810
 a wound explanation I do not call you 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.090
 believe only him but we still have it all 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.980
 discuss later in more detail please 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.540
 you guys if you suddenly noticed 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.250
 any inconsistencies pachino or 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.380
 comments there most likely everyone already 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.990
 explained and about all my my shoals 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.210
 favorite subscribers have already reported well 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.560
 that's all dear friends for today all 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.560
 bye bye bye good luck
