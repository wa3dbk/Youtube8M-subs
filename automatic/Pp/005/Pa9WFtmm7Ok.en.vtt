solid I thought if you're adding a cup
of<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> batter<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.620> cupcakes<00:00:59.219> that

of like for a batter of cupcakes that
makes<00:00:59.550> 24<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.780> add<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.289> cup<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
I like the title yet to taste my by a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.339 
I like the title yet to taste my by a
knife<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.450> right<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:12.959> you're<00:02:13.049> not<00:02:13.140> just

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
knife through right so you're not just

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.470 
knife through right so you're not just
like<00:02:13.469> I<00:02:13.650> got<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> hint<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.609> yeah<00:02:14.909> so<00:02:15.450> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
like I got a hint of this yeah so I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.809 
like I got a hint of this yeah so I
think<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.349> does<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.829> if<00:02:17.159> I<00:02:17.250> popped<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:17.730> open

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
think it does have if I popped it open

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.880 
think it does have if I popped it open
before<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.569> does<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> strawberry<00:02:19.319> puree

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
before it does have a strawberry puree

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.949 
before it does have a strawberry puree
in<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> kind<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.090> colors<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.689> little

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
in it so it kind of colors it a little

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.539 
in it so it kind of colors it a little
bit<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.349> know<00:02:22.379> but<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:22.769> also<00:02:22.950> put<00:02:23.219> the<00:02:23.370> whole

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
bit you know but we also put the whole

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.250 
bit you know but we also put the whole
strawberry<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.329> there<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:24.959> getting

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
strawberry in there so you're getting

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.289 
strawberry in there so you're getting
that<00:02:25.290> texture<00:02:25.889> into<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.250> plate<00:02:26.489> right<00:02:27.000> and

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
add through into your frosting or is it

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.129 
add through into your frosting or is it

doing<00:03:22.220> true<00:03:22.579> rays<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.390> moment<00:03:23.720> frozen<00:03:23.959> are

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
doing true rays so the moment frozen are

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.490 
doing true rays so the moment frozen are
actually<00:03:24.940> fantastic<00:03:25.940> right<00:03:26.359> a<00:03:26.390> good<00:03:26.750> plan

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
actually fantastic right a good plan

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.020 
actually fantastic right a good plan
and<00:03:28.770> their<00:03:29.040> pets<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.580> height<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and their pets at the height of the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.190 
and their pets at the height of the
season<00:03:30.480> where<00:03:30.600> they<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> most<00:03:30.960> flavor

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
season where they have the most flavor

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.460 
season where they have the most flavor
right<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.460> if<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.000> let<00:03:33.450> those<00:03:33.600> fall<00:03:33.930> out<00:03:34.170> all

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
right so if you let those fall out all

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.230 
right so if you let those fall out all
of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.830> sudden<00:03:35.130> they're<00:03:35.250> very<00:03:35.430> juicy<00:03:35.730> and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
of the sudden they're very juicy and

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.030 
of the sudden they're very juicy and
then<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.630> puree<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.560> won't<00:03:37.770> want<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
then you puree it you won't want to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.680 
then you puree it you won't want to
necessarily<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:38.880> with<00:03:39.000> blueberries<00:03:39.540> but

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
necessarily do it with blueberries but

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.090 
necessarily do it with blueberries but
any<00:03:39.900> food<00:03:40.230> you're<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.740> be<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.950> way

any food you're going to be the way

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.400 
any food you're going to be the way

peaches those are mango because they're

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.230 
peaches those are mango because they're
all<00:03:46.530> great<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.070> isn't<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.430> let<00:03:47.580> them<00:03:47.700> pop<00:03:47.940> and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
all great so isn't it let them pop and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.970 
all great so isn't it let them pop and
puree<00:03:48.600> them<00:03:48.810> because<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.320> creates<00:03:49.620> an

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
puree them because it just creates an

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.140 
puree them because it just creates an
automatic<00:03:50.580> juiciness

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
automatic juiciness

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.120 
automatic juiciness
is<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> ratio<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.710> tend<00:03:52.950> to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
is there a ratio that you tend to

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.450 
is there a ratio that you tend to
recommend<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.970> becomes<00:03:54.240> all<00:03:54.570> blue<00:03:54.900> that's

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
recommend if it becomes all blue that's

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.560 
recommend if it becomes all blue that's
right<00:03:56.460> you've<00:03:56.700> gone<00:03:56.880> too<00:03:57.240> far

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
right you've gone too far

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.780 
right you've gone too far
well<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.140> can<00:03:58.290> kind<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.590> tell<00:03:58.860> with<00:03:59.610> these

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
well you can kind of tell with these

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.699 
well you can kind of tell with these
cupcakes<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.630> then<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.959> can<00:04:01.110> slam<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.620> it's

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
cupcakes is then you can slam and it's

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.190 
cupcakes is then you can slam and it's
got<00:04:01.890> blueberry<00:04:02.370> all<00:04:02.610> around<00:04:02.970> them<00:04:03.240> but<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
got blueberry all around them but I

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500 
got blueberry all around them but I
think<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.010> batch<00:04:05.370> there's<00:04:06.000> probably

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
think for this batch there's probably

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.780 
think for this batch there's probably
about<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.720> couple<00:04:07.200> new<00:04:07.440> berries<00:04:07.830> for<00:04:08.220> 24

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
over it'll still rise it'll still do

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.880 
over it'll still rise it'll still do
everything<00:04:13.080> it's<00:04:13.230> supposed<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
then what about the ways to fold it in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.460 
then what about the ways to fold it in
is<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.570> know<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.930> don't<00:04:22.109> want<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.350> get

always go down the center of your bowl

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.470 
always go down the center of your bowl
and<00:04:39.980> up<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.190> over<00:04:41.280> because<00:04:41.880> you<00:04:42.090> spend<00:04:42.360> all

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
and up and over because you spend all

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.530 
and up and over because you spend all
this<00:04:42.540> time<00:04:43.400> creaming<00:04:44.400> your<00:04:44.430> butter<00:04:44.790> creaming

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
this time creaming your butter creaming

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.830 
this time creaming your butter creaming
your<00:04:45.780> sugar<00:04:46.050> right

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
your sugar right

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.390 
your sugar right
getting<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.350> rise<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.980> don't<00:04:48.160> want<00:04:48.310> to

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
getting that rise you don't want to

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.590 
getting that rise you don't want to
deflate<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.970> by<00:04:49.090> adding<00:04:49.330> an<00:04:49.510> additional

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
deflate it by adding an additional

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.790 
deflate it by adding an additional
radius

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
radius

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.610 
radius
so<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> blueberries<00:04:52.060> careful<00:04:52.600> then<00:04:53.169> pull

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
so the blueberries careful then pull

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.780 
so the blueberries careful then pull
through<00:04:53.889> something<00:04:54.340> that's<00:04:54.430> really

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
through something that's really

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.540 
through something that's really
important<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.930> you<00:04:56.320> want<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.740> cover<00:04:57.310> your

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
important and you want to cover your

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.969 
important and you want to cover your
move

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
move

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.129 
move
so<00:04:59.979> if<00:05:00.189> your<00:05:00.340> total<00:05:00.639> box<00:05:01.030> uses<00:05:01.539> say<00:05:01.689> two<00:05:01.900> cups
