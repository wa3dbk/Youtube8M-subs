00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.349
 there is no reduction of the tax burden 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.750
 which falls on workers over 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:11.150
 the families and the people and I will try 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.299
 to demonstrate that she is a minister by 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.160
 to the most modern pedagogical techniques 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.890
 showing that what most have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.340
 come to say 'this is false is wrong' 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.490
 we have here the tax revenue of 2 thousand 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.550
 books fall alone foot of these 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.180
 represents 100 million euros are 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.390
 here 91 pieces or six and nine thousand and one hundred 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.480
 tax revenue in millions of euros 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.420
 in 2002 on this issue. 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.329
 there are doubts what the government did in 2003 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.999
 made a brutal increase in taxes 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.129
 as a result of which is the sect of irs 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.999
 increased by 3 thousand and two hundred million 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.609
 I'm here 32 pieces lines 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:57.379
 result, the tax burden exceeded 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.389
 12 billion euros 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.429
 many of them will have thought the government will 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:03.440
 reverse the brutal increase in taxes 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.269
 way the tax burden returns to the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.360
 previous levels but not what the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.820
 government made it a way of irs a 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.090
 designated as having a significant impact on the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.689
 says the government 150 million euros 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 we have to take a piece and a half here and 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.610
 it is tax burden is this is the relief of 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.789
 which Mrs Cecilia speaks 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.700
 meireles and the 150 million euros 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.750
 in favor of families is not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.359
 in our families 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 the government invented the tax loss and 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.280
 transformed what they were imposed 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.439
 income tax on direct income in 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.350
 indirect taxes 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.820
 curious moment almost the same value 160 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 millions of euros than what was 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.100
 withdrawn in a lake is now placed under the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.710
 way of supervising 0 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.090
 taxation decreased so does not maintain 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.219
 but if there is more 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.689
 the government still created the taxes 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.939
 consumer spending has increased 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.399
 taxes is represented by 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.979
 20 chickens but taxes on 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.679
 various materials that increase the load 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.780
 tax that the Portuguese have to pay 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.310
 the accounts show graphs 5 in 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.760
 communities with space and the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.900
 3d dimension 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.900
 but accumulated
