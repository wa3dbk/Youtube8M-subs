president Park an expert at least in
this<00:00:52.020> tell<00:00:53.020> everybody<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:54.610> difference<00:00:55.090> or<00:00:55.300> at

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
this tell everybody the difference or at

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:07.469 
this tell everybody the difference or at
least<00:00:55.920> what<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.820> think<00:01:06.909> thing<00:01:07.299> with

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
least what I think thing with

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.969 
least what I think thing with
powerlifting<00:01:08.409> benchpress

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
powerlifting benchpress

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.399 
powerlifting benchpress
obviously<00:01:09.579> it's<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:10.659> about<00:01:10.840> lifting<00:01:11.020> -<00:01:11.259> wait

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
obviously it's all about lifting - wait

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.139 
obviously it's all about lifting - wait
so<00:01:11.649> you're<00:01:11.770> trying<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.100> get<00:01:12.219> as<00:01:12.340> many<00:01:12.640> muscles

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
so you're trying to get as many muscles

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.760 
so you're trying to get as many muscles
involved<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.810> lifting<00:01:14.259> that<00:01:14.380> weight<00:01:14.439> as<00:01:14.740> you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
involved in lifting that weight as you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.850 
involved in lifting that weight as you
possibly<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.549> so<00:01:16.290> whereas<00:01:17.290> if<00:01:17.439> you're<00:01:17.590> trying

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
possibly can so whereas if you're trying

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.569 
possibly can so whereas if you're trying
to<00:01:17.920> develop<00:01:18.249> a<00:01:18.429> chest<00:01:19.469> and<00:01:20.469> what<00:01:20.889> a<00:01:21.359> basic<00:01:23.579> well

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
to develop a chest and what a basic well

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.129 
to develop a chest and what a basic well
at<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.819> farm<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.119> think<00:01:25.299> benchpress<00:01:25.539> obviously

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:26.139 
at the farm I think benchpress obviously

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:29.129 
at the farm I think benchpress obviously
wide<00:01:26.950> feet<00:01:27.340> tight<00:01:28.240> back<00:01:28.509> you'd<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:28.929> to<00:01:28.990> be<00:01:29.109> a

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:29.139 
wide feet tight back you'd want to be a

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.499 
wide feet tight back you'd want to be a
rock<00:01:29.409> on<00:01:29.619> that<00:01:29.770> bench<00:01:30.009> basement<00:01:30.579> is<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:31.029> most

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
rock on that bench basement is the most

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.830 
rock on that bench basement is the most
dear<00:01:31.749> one<00:01:32.049> max<00:01:32.459> rep<00:01:33.459> bench<00:01:33.999> is<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.569> to<00:01:34.719> be<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
dear one max rep bench is going to be a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.969 
dear one max rep bench is going to be a
lot<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.020> weight<00:01:35.170> for<00:01:35.529> most<00:01:35.619> people<00:01:36.009> anyway<00:01:36.310> so

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
lot of weight for most people anyway so

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.529 
lot of weight for most people anyway so
you<00:01:38.979> have<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.399> be<00:01:39.579> this<00:01:39.880> solid<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.509> you

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
you have to be this solid as you

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.539 
you have to be this solid as you
possibly<00:01:41.049> can<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.619> stable<00:01:41.889> as<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.219> possibly

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
possibly can as stable as you possibly

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.649 
possibly can as stable as you possibly
can<00:01:42.789> wide<00:01:43.539> feet<00:01:43.929> back<00:01:44.829> tight<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:46.509> that

can wide feet back tight when that

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.139 
can wide feet back tight when that
weights<00:01:46.899> coming<00:01:47.229> down<00:01:47.409> it's<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.219> about<00:01:48.520> being

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
weights coming down it's all about being

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.560 
weights coming down it's all about being
able<00:01:49.389> to<00:01:49.659> put<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.679> force<00:01:51.340> back<00:01:51.639> to<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.909> bar

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.359 

and<00:01:55.570> being<00:01:55.810> stabilized<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> process<00:01:57.130> so

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and being stabilized in the process so

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.370 
and being stabilized in the process so
you<00:01:58.060> know<00:01:58.149> technically<00:01:58.540> speaking<00:01:58.899> if<00:01:59.229> you're

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
you know technically speaking if you're

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.319 
you know technically speaking if you're
bench-pressing<00:02:00.189> for<00:02:00.490> power<00:02:00.700> but<00:02:00.939> even<00:02:01.210> your

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
bench-pressing for power but even your

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.929 
bench-pressing for power but even your
glutes<00:02:01.630> should<00:02:02.290> be<00:02:02.439> oh<00:02:02.820> contract

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
glutes should be oh contract

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.600 
glutes should be oh contract
absolutely<00:02:04.930> all<00:02:05.350> right<00:02:05.500> now<00:02:05.680> discuss<00:02:06.580> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
absolutely all right now discuss the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.600 
absolutely all right now discuss the
difference<00:02:07.149> what<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.630> always<00:02:08.050> say<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:09.250> develop

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
difference what I always say to develop

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.030 
difference what I always say to develop
a<00:02:09.670> physique<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.420> train<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.319> muscle<00:02:11.709> not<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
a physique is train the muscle not the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.940 
a physique is train the muscle not the
movement<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.000> unfortunately<00:02:13.900> people<00:02:14.620> when

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
movement and unfortunately people when

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.710 
movement and unfortunately people when
they<00:02:15.040> get<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.340> squats<00:02:15.730> deadlifts<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.480> bench

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
they get to squats deadlifts and bench

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.300 
they get to squats deadlifts and bench
press<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:17.140> seem<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.470> forget<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.190> they

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
press they seem to forget that then they

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.720 
press they seem to forget that then they
get<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> be<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.819> my<00:02:19.209> numbers<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.550> one<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
get to be all my numbers so one of the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.910 
get to be all my numbers so one of the
things<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.150> want<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.480> emphasize<00:02:22.720> this<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.800> one

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
things we want to emphasize this for one

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.650 
things we want to emphasize this for one
the<00:02:24.069> bench<00:02:24.250> press<00:02:24.459> isn't<00:02:24.849> necessarily<00:02:25.480> that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
the bench press isn't necessarily that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.150 
the bench press isn't necessarily that
great<00:02:25.810> antagonist<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.769> chest<00:02:27.010> development

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
great antagonist for chest development

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.490 
great antagonist for chest development
anyway<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.299> whole<00:02:28.510> different<00:02:28.540> argument

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
anyway that's a whole different argument

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.229 
anyway that's a whole different argument
if<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.430> use<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.790> bench<00:02:30.970> press

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
if you are going to use the bench press

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.449 
if you are going to use the bench press
for<00:02:31.540> chest<00:02:31.780> development<00:02:31.930> list<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.769> few<00:02:33.040> things

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
for chest development list a few things

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.210 
for chest development list a few things
you<00:02:33.670> need<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.850> be<00:02:34.680> aware<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:36.069> are

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
you need to be aware of that are

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.840 
you need to be aware of that are
different<00:02:36.549> than<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.220> show<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.459> how<00:02:39.790> to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
different than if I show you how to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.390 
different than if I show you how to
bench<00:02:40.330> press<00:02:40.390> correctly<00:02:41.319> for<00:02:41.560> chest<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
bench press correctly for chest the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.890 
bench press correctly for chest the
chances<00:02:42.819> are<00:02:42.970> your<00:02:43.209> numbers<00:02:43.510> aren't<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.810> to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
chances are your numbers aren't going to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.539 
chances are your numbers aren't going to
go<00:02:43.989> with<00:02:44.080> all<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.380> hot<00:02:44.680> but<00:02:45.310> you're

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
go with all that hot but you're

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.460 
go with all that hot but you're
isolating<00:02:46.150> impacts<00:02:46.480> what<00:02:46.690> we<00:02:46.780> call<00:02:46.989> target

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
isolating impacts what we call target

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.680 
isolating impacts what we call target
and<00:02:47.890> that's<00:02:48.489> very<00:02:48.760> important<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.239> we'll<00:02:49.510> do

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
and that's very important so we'll do

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.840 
and that's very important so we'll do
things<00:02:49.989> like<00:02:50.200> shift<00:02:51.100> our<00:02:51.280> feet<00:02:51.519> up<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
things like shift our feet up on the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.000 
things like shift our feet up on the
band<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.360> bench<00:02:52.599> ignite<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.470> creates<00:02:53.830> what

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
band of a bench ignite that creates what

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.460 
band of a bench ignite that creates what
I<00:02:54.040> call<00:02:54.250> joint<00:02:54.519> stress<00:02:54.910> transfer<00:02:55.180> which<00:02:55.959> it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
I call joint stress transfer which it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.300 
I call joint stress transfer which it
transfers<00:02:57.220> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.309 

joints<00:03:00.670> when<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> feet<00:03:01.360> are<00:03:01.510> planted<00:03:01.780> which

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
joints when the feet are planted which

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.050 
joints when the feet are planted which
puts<00:03:02.620> more<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.400> shoulders<00:03:03.819> which

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
puts more on the shoulders which

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.870 
puts more on the shoulders which
involves<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> exodus<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.340> we're<00:03:06.700> going<00:03:06.790> to
