00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.990
 the dream of eternal life has always been pursued by the human being 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.070
 who pays a fortune to have his body frozen in liquid nitrogen 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.290
 and probably many of these people would also pay one to have a stamp 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.679
 own 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.169
 perhaps it is possible to form human beings without risk of 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.329
 malformations or diseases and when that date arrives there are many questions 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.460
 ethical 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.640
 why talk 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.720
 who should be charged 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.449
 and who will decide 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.600
 and if it were possible to paste human beings you would be prepared 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800
 talk young 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.120
 give time 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.100
 because 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.470
 because I do not think human beings need to be formed 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.330
 there are already a lot of people in the world I do not think I need this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.450
 and also does not believe that it is worth research in collage to the ace 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.730
 human beings are condemned 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.230
 but why 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.160
 the technique will bring many benefits you can skip the gate 10 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.110
 here one can prostitute the other in one's own person 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 as one heart per person we are seeing a child 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.370
 for other things I can if the aid plan is approved if the population 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 There are a lot of people dying because of this. 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.860
 by the fact that there are other half people to problems 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.540
 bullying 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.840
 no need to train taking all this take off all problems 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.150
 nice weather 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.040
 and the cloning of extinct animals and knows that it is quite interesting you 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.299
 participate in the extinction of species 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.040
 not that you participate renato animals for studies that benefit the human being 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.750
 indirectly 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 this issue of endangered animals can be a palliative measure. 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.660
 plants I think may have several other 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.360
 is to deal with a threat to the expansion 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.460
 what is possible with the selection of the city prepared, certainly not 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.479
 because 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 the model gives two work then I think we hit the mass for the population 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:18.819
 you never wanted is exactly the same guy 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:25.499
 its different environment cp that even the univocal costing twins could 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.099
 be called cones 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.879
 they do not behave in the same way they are not exactly the same 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.239
 was raised the police question somehow 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.239
 our effort on another woman's top titles 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.589
 I have also 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.749
 in the western section 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.809
 to me and he was 2 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.219
 were over 10 weeks not worth it
