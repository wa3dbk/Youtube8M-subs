00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.830
 drost 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 drost prima ball here is the first chance 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.900
 of the competition that is for zwolle 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 the rescue of cillessen excellent 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.080
 played football 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.080
 no don't get into me 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.289
 chad 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.490
 klaassen then the van rijn goes away 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.370
 sent so from Rhine there looks 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.220
 Without this doctor comes caught by 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 will be introduced again by van Rijn 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.590
 so if it's a great opening phase 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.590
 in the arena 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.470
 from hinte 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.470
 of in terms not already for box box 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.180
 does the very good bonus wood then felled 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.350
 is there still simulate saymak 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.350
 strong start of pec zwolle 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 moisander 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.380
 it was thirty meters now delivered 16 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 the ball at otherwise a nice sinless 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 by himself and perhaps he has 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.750
 bothered by the sigthorsson 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 his teammate they still cost up and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.270
 down in the first ten minutes it is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.270
 a good duel 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 who came to rest and knew up close 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 everyone actually 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.479
 you cannot get the ball away and now you can 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.310
 boarders screwed in too sharply by van 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.310
 hintum and missed by rienstra 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.550
 then that seems like a serious problem 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.110
 to be with the man who is so good to sweet 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 run the mustafa saymak 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.080
 but that driver arises exactly 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 so hard to see but can't go on 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.380
 then I can make lukoki an entrance 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.060
 pair we cut missed rain one 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.210
 injury to his knee against his old one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.210
 club 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.940
 for the goal sigthorsson what that injured 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.620
 members 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 Presidents just a fraction too sharp 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.280
 from the else 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.450
 van rijn yes put under pressure then makes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.450
 he there the fault here is lukoki 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.080
 and where the first paul got them there 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.120
 watch out 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.920
 then it ends well for Ajax would 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.110
 want to threaten pec zwolle plates 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.360
 his Amsterdam dammers are classed 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.490
 sigthorsson dangerous game compared 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.490
 from bourges that is a reflex I think 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.810
 from kolbeinn sigthorsson but with that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.550
 for cause I hurt you a lot 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.960
 jealous 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.960
 good morning a shed of blood 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.850
 this then runs from journal to the front 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.470
 ajax diseases under the ball and that 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.890
 header is still very nice of many 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.890
 of the debt not so crazy much 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.920
 type rings and boilers are the people 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.160
 that were taken off by feeding 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.450
 at pec zwolle you will be the australian it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.890
 lots of things about it 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.180
 sainsbury now is boerse with the plaintiff 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.410
 support 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.410
 misty look in the eyes 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.500
 thomas 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.500
 has support their thirst 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.519
 rienstra rienstra posted nice 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.909
 possibility anyway for pec zwolle for 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.909
 am rienstra 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.650
 moisander 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.170
 Sigthorsson 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.400
 just Rhine moves 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.500
 van Rijn with the opening on otherwise different 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 in the penalty box area took him 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.480
 different and watched ball from to the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.080
 dean cleverly played with someone on that 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.080
 walk in the ball 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.800
 disease will not found good prompts 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.930
 from the cs mary 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.410
 zwolle is in the transition to the neck 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.120
 after which thomas asked so yes ajax 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.020
 allowed some space 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.610
 may order from 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900
 use for the toppers and the copy 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.990
 this way the Amsterdammers get something again 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.990
 different 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.020
 camera top 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.470
 how to continuously copy the ball by hand 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.889
 Ajax 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.469
 whole send the ball again chain 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.210
 schÃ¶ne choose name the second pole is the 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.460
 Klaassen Sigthorsson at the first post 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.909
 at the are not bound 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.169
 competition is now coming to life from that 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:55.009
 looked at me wanted from the farmer is not yet 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.629
 know one in advance but still without loot one 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.009
 tricky opponent has become last 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.199
 years of ajax was an understatement 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.969
 considering the results in the last year 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.419
 full action competition then with two but 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.870
 was hardly served to do in zwolle 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.870
 from play 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.870
 Sigthorsson 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.750
 all draw to rhine and showed 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.669
 inside to make room for the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.419
 right back who could be this president and 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:25.190
 sigthorsson awkward okay with the rebound 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.190
 can be worked inside and schÃ¶ne 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.620
 paul van van rijn is good at the second 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.000
 pole a difficult option for the 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.000
 diseases or through the grounds set the bar 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.750
 but nice not done by choose to 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.729
 so possession of the ball for pec zwolle 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.439
 Thomas Bayes 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.729
 no see from distance is a nice one 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:49.759
 They will attempt for the first time 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.439
 actually in the second half they tested 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.770
 how is such a spring in being van 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.770
 hintum 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.680
 Thomas extended 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.990
 van der werf 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.180
 ball loss and your ajax runs with the five 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.740
 men 5 who will need this 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.990
 are therefore in front of ajax 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.500
 choose after must go fast starts in lk 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.660
 see l see you would start doubting 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.280
 the ball was on the way this must have wanted to 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.770
 you a half-hearted attempt by one 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.400
 from el ghazi to that easter 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.400
 from krishna 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.129
 nick clear impatient blowing 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.379
 sigthorsson choose place position 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.810
 rights back on choose choose after with the 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.400
 chance anyway in the second hero 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.090
 what could have been ajax before 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.090
 Ricardo Kishna 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.710
 and then the last whistle of 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:46.389
 house and so there ajax and swelled at 0 0 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.789
 flute concert might just be something 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.020
 exaggerated for the farmer's team 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:51.729
 that is the fourth time in a row 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.349
 rajah's don't win from zwolle 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.120
 he never won as a trainer 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.590
 from ajax not yet if it just stays that way 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.729
 with a point and arena 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.500
 will undoubtedly be able to 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.139
 more birds live it for ajax almost 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.500
 big chances and therefore 0 0 at a stand in 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.500
 Amsterdam
