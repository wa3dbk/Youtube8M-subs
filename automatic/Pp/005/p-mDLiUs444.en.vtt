00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone with you ray gas and today I 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 I will pass the wave b is my second 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.800
 an account where the power is 3,500 at that was 2,000 and 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.380
 this call I will pass with 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.809
 a ruby building in my opinion is a building 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 great for wave b rather than 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 angular tried wave c to pass but not 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.500
 It turned out at the fifth stage c5 I was killed 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 but yes it is clear because I have everything 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.109
 heroes little pumped all of you there 40 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 level and almost all the usual few 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 I have two legends in this bg 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.270
 and knight knights I recently bought for now 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 did not swing but soon i will be it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.790
 swing bg queen serpent werewolf 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.730
 sniper and angel is that five 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 who will stand on the protection of databases and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.289
 the rest I will put the tower werewolf 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.410
 me to be a tank but on appeal 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.800
 monsters he rarely tanchik and yet he 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.510
 need as he has a lot of life points 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.320
 bg pumped me up to the second level for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.760
 that he more hit targets 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.329
 each new level skill adds 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
 two goals 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.260
 beginning he hits 6 targets queen serpent 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 sniper and angels, I did not touch because 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.869
 I will soon buy new heroes 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.659
 then the prisoners seem to be sitting up 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.710
 prisoners in the tower so let's start 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:27.150
 call for pulp and paper industry could not come here at my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 425 tried and there was a failure starting 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.060
 call b mom would go with the magicians to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 of this i tried to pass with griffins and 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.040
 suffered defeat 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.210
 but then I understood why because 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.460
 reading damage to the first level griffins 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.259
 much weaker than maguire well that is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 of magic 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 practically say he will win 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.189
 the amount of fat the longer they 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.990
 stronger and then they are in less chorus but 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.930
 bigger and bigger 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.399
 so I stand on all three 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.399
 barracks mages 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 can be man can come with 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.900
 centaurs and neurotic well worth 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.480
 protection 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.269
 to distinguish a sin which dies sound 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 blows and as we see for some reason sniper 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.560
 I hang on the wall but such a dream does not 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 it happens that he beat me 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 for someone to beat the wall at all 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.380
 they are not here right through that is not 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.480
 break bypass but he just did on 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 break freeze player 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.150
 have been experienced 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.540
 well you do n't need anyone for time on and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:53.319
 it's all too much, you can fly any day 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.299
 other players attacking them without losing 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:03.130
 mainly masses and troops 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:04.540
 only the heroes went second wave well and 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.760
 love her and understandably because they carried 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.850
 method for the towers but these are just now 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.660
 lured generally does not always work 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.579
 my bait 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.680
 ruby allegiance to what i have 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.100
 building in two layers they're three like this 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.500
 need to 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.910
 Nukwe as it was with a sniper who 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.370
 hung on coal 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.720
 it's good that he has 2 more zone 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.620
 reach there were those that stand and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.730
 hammer and I think 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.560
 single tower there i don't know any 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 exhibit hall and before him not 2 articles he 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 worth it so kills for three minutes in person 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.370
 after the second of Kiev to seek campo 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:53.280
 you want closer and it happens pretty 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.840
 look often 5055 lucky already 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.010
 so I stayed and closer these 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.570
 Construction did not begin to clear all waves 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.570
 long pass they stand these heroes and 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.060
 kill and built while in the tower 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.280
 does not reach when i will have green 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.800
 hero so i buy them or won in 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.060
 roulette and pumped the string level and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.540
 skill 2 9 3 out of 9 passengers tower here 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.910
 then they will reach everyone 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.160
 the build that is here is here to war 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.580
 shorter dacha build 3 places there need 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.070
 some 12 walls and here it is you all 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.860
 chic but i think by this time i 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.070
 I will already pass intrigues and waves once I 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.620
 already almost passed with yes yes for I fall 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.970
 slightly pumped up heroes 1010 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.770
 and as we see the last wave now it seems 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.590
 how do we win we lose that way 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.410
 incomprehensibly passive fifty goes all of 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.810
 heroes they already killed and experiment on 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.780
 the tower, I thought that something to cope with 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.600
 me constantly that is straightened out but that 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.180
 secured a defeat 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.390
 No, we can do it, they killed 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.430
 mom retail and that he got experience 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.090
 it is remarkable that it should be very 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.140
 received 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:18.430
 for you heard taught 9050 in my 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.470
 maxim i got 10,000 now let's see 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.930
 how many who pumped 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:29.380
 i.e. the werewolf was pumped over by the king 8 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.600
 our angel angels while I swing while I 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.700
 no druid 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.800
 but this account is generally a few days 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.690
 that is, there is only a small 14 day and 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.900
 I can say even more as much 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:49.000
 on the other to the cherished can say well 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:54.610
 and everything is in principle 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.720
 fb was successful we won though all 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:01.660
 heroes were killed but ours are so strong 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:07.920
 the towers were able to contain the pressure 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.920
 heroes they overpowered them and killed 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.760
 thanks everyone for watching you were ray
