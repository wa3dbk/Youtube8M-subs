00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hi girls today will be on mascara 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.360
 snow eyes make-up brush 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 is composed of five small balls and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 said one after the other type one between 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.969
 civic threes, however, with this with 5 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.969
 so it's easy 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 inside there are 10.5 grams of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 product for a total of 12 euros and 50 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 meanwhile there is to say that this mascara 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 compared to the classic mascara we have 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.710
 at home and without parabens without petrolatum 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.590
 without silicones therefore still composed 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.620
 from a lot of natural ingredients 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.930
 dinners in water there is within the wax alba 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 if inside but it was really said of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 all there was the roof accepts 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.420
 if you go to the site read all the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 ingredients without christ here to list 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 because otherwise we are not by 2 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.570
 minutes to say that when I have it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.410
 received is a bit skeptical because 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 however it is difficult to know that it is difficult 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 formulate a mascara that does not contain 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.290
 filatori filati and that of a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.890
 volume and intensity to the eye 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 so anyway I was kind of sarah 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 terrible poor now I have tested it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 for two weeks putting on almost 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.740
 not always every day we have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.880
 put to cult mascara but I put it on 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.680
 a voucher 6 7 times 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 I wanted to see if he could 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
 have a volume effect be the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.000
 mascara remained his the news during the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.189
 day because there is always anyway 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.790
 this risk but digs that natural 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 begin to fly down careers I do 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.430
 see the effect that we then talk about 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.590
 the formula is a bit dry then when 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.570
 you know it is normal if you see a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 bit dry the product is not old 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.960
 that just came out 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600
 if he was already old we thought we were put 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.329
 badly though it is quite dry like 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.920
 formula of this effect with a 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.420
 passed this is the effect with le 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 only pass on this that this always 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.509
 with one then you see the difference e 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 now this effect has passed by 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.689
 mascara 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 this then is the contracting effect 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.420
 pass mascara as you can see 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.120
 anyway 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.160
 despite being a natural mascara from 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.130
 truly volume to the lashes from the long 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.900
 really therefore it is a product that 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.840
 surely it didn't make me say wow 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.489
 because anyway it lengthens me decide but 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 not so much mascara as I have 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.870
 tried to be a mascara though 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.910
 natural is really worth and my vote 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 so for this mascara etro roller of 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.340
 8 drums or to be a mascara 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.650
 bio is a really fantastic mascara 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.050
 formula a bit dry but you can not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.489
 expect to find water in every 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.500
 corner of the desert so there 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.040
 we content ourselves with what we find if 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.709
 you are inside the vegan bio etc. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.090
 etc. surely give him one 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.090
 eye a wink hello to you
