okay<00:00:01.319> in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.530> tutorial<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:02.100> gonna<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.399> a

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay in this tutorial we're gonna take a

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.679 
okay in this tutorial we're gonna take a
look<00:00:02.550> at<00:00:02.700> armatures<00:00:03.179> again<00:00:03.480> because<00:00:03.659> I

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
look at armatures again because I

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.999 
look at armatures again because I
haven't<00:00:03.810> covered<00:00:03.990> them<00:00:04.200> for<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> while<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
haven't covered them for a while and

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
haven't covered them for a while and
I've<00:00:05.430> got<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.180> realizing<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.779> there's<00:00:06.990> one

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I've got to realizing that there's one

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.379 
I've got to realizing that there's one
aspect<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.830> armatures<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.580> use<00:00:08.790> quite

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
aspect about armatures that I use quite

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.209 
aspect about armatures that I use quite
consistently<00:00:10.019> these<00:00:10.260> days<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.070> much

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
consistently these days that is so much

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.589 
consistently these days that is so much
more<00:00:11.280> powerful<00:00:11.460> than<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.090> old<00:00:12.300> way<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.450> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
more powerful than the old way that I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.999 
more powerful than the old way that I
used<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.380> figured<00:00:13.740> I'd<00:00:13.830> let<00:00:13.980> you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
used to do it that I figured I'd let you

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.379 
used to do it that I figured I'd let you
know<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.549> I'll<00:00:14.639> kind<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> let<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.059> discover

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
know and I'll kind of let you discover

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.599 
know and I'll kind of let you discover
them<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.719> your<00:00:15.839> own<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.320> I'll<00:00:17.250> give<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> the

them on your own but I'll give you the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.429 
them on your own but I'll give you the
kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> basic<00:00:18.240> setup<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.350> I'm

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
kind of the basic setup here so I'm

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.859 
kind of the basic setup here so I'm
gonna<00:00:19.529> go<00:00:19.710> into<00:00:20.039> ortho<00:00:21.029> modal<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.660> real

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
gonna go into ortho modal in this real

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.140 
gonna go into ortho modal in this real
quick<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.470> I'll<00:00:23.039> put<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.490> cursor<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
quick here I'll put my cursor to the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.279 
quick here I'll put my cursor to the
selected<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:25.050> add<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> bone<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.250> thing

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
selected I'll add a bone to the thing

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
selected I'll add a bone to the thing
we'll<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> quick<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.070> easy<00:00:29.150> version

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
we'll just do a quick and easy version

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.420 
we'll just do a quick and easy version
of<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.019> better<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.529> x-ray<00:00:31.800> mode

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.590 

move<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> down<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:35.820> edit<00:00:36.480> mode<00:00:36.690> grab<00:00:37.350> this

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
move it down here edit mode grab this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.619 
move it down here edit mode grab this
tip<00:00:39.600> move<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:41.300> grab<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> whole

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
tip move it up there grab the whole

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.590 
tip move it up there grab the whole
thing<00:00:42.660> subdivide<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.010> couple<00:00:44.640> times<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
thing subdivide it a couple times like

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.990 
thing subdivide it a couple times like
this<00:00:46.190> alright<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this alright so there it is in the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
this alright so there it is in the
center<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:51.350> I'll<00:00:52.350> parent<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.160> know

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
center so then I'll parent it you know

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
center so then I'll parent it you know
before<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> parented<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> always

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
before I parented actually what I always

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
before I parented actually what I always
like<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.410> want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.910> go<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.030> edit

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
like to do is I want to go into edit

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
like to do is I want to go into edit
mode<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.899> make<00:00:58.410> sure<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.739> subdivided

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
mode on this make sure it's subdivided

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
mode on this make sure it's subdivided
first<00:00:59.579> cuz<00:00:59.850> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:00:59.969> don't<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
first cuz if you don't then when you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
first cuz if you don't then when you
parent<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.129> bone<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> move

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
parent it then this bone when you move

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
parent it then this bone when you move
it's<00:01:03.329> gonna<00:01:03.449> stick<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> mesh<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it's gonna stick out of the mesh and I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.050 
it's gonna stick out of the mesh and I
don't<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.659> happen<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.460> since

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
don't want that to happen so in so since

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
don't want that to happen so in so since
it<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> already<00:01:09.540> subdivided<00:01:10.260> then

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it is already subdivided then

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
it is already subdivided then
now<00:01:11.520> I'll<00:01:11.670> parent<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.330> automatic

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
now I'll parent it with automatic

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.710 
now I'll parent it with automatic
weights<00:01:13.490> like<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.479> come<00:01:15.659> up

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
weights like this then when I come up

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.070 
weights like this then when I come up
here<00:01:15.900> we'll<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.110> verify<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.040> pose<00:01:17.549> mode

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
here we'll just verify it in pose mode

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.539 
here we'll just verify it in pose mode
I'll<00:01:19.080> grab<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> butt<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.920> press<00:01:20.100> shift<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I'll grab that butt and press shift I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.780 
I'll grab that butt and press shift I
add<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:21.119> empty<00:01:21.420> object<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:22.020> grab<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.790> press

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
add an empty object here grab this press

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
add an empty object here grab this press
g<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.080> under<00:01:25.350> control<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
g and there it is under control if you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.160 
g and there it is under control if you
had<00:01:26.280> not<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> subdivided<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
had not had it subdivided and then you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
had not had it subdivided and then you
subdivided<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> after<00:01:29.280> he<00:01:29.369> had<00:01:29.460> parented<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
subdivided it after he had parented it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.359 
subdivided it after he had parented it
it<00:01:30.540> would<00:01:30.689> still<00:01:30.930> bend<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
it would still bend around like this but

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.340 
it would still bend around like this but
this<00:01:32.579> armature<00:01:33.420> would<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> sticking<00:01:34.200> outside

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this armature would be sticking outside

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
this armature would be sticking outside
of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> mesh<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> curved<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of the mesh when you curved in like this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
of the mesh when you curved in like this
it's<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.320> subtle<00:01:37.530> subtle

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it's just a little subtle subtle

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
it's just a little subtle subtle
difference<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> let's<00:01:41.700> control<00:01:42.390> Z

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
difference all right so let's control Z

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.330 
difference all right so let's control Z
that<00:01:42.869> back<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:44.130> need

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that back there so I don't really need

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.740 
that back there so I don't really need
this<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> verify<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this that's just to verify that that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
this that's just to verify that that
works<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.110> I'll<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.350> rid<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:46.890> here

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
works so I'll get rid of that one here

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
works so I'll get rid of that one here
but<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.759> let's<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:50.240> IKE<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> constraint

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
but now let's put a an IKE a constraint

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
but now let's put a an IKE a constraint
in<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.070> edit<00:01:53.340> mode<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.790> I'll

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
in here so with in edit mode here I'll

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
in here so with in edit mode here I'll
just<00:01:54.140> press<00:01:55.140> E<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> maybe<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.070> another

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
just press E and maybe gonna do another

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.620 
just press E and maybe gonna do another
one<00:01:56.490> down<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:56.909> as<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.210> e<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.939> right

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
one down here as well e like that right

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
one down here as well e like that right
there<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.079> want<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.500> rid<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> wanna

there I want to get rid of it I wanna

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
there I want to get rid of it I wanna
get<00:02:02.369> rid<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> parent<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> one<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.140> I'm

constraints sitting up there

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.040 
constraints sitting up there
alright<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.060> now<00:02:50.269> when<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.450> grab<00:02:50.690> this<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
alright so now when I grab this and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.110 
alright so now when I grab this and
press<00:02:51.260> G<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.620> should<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.160> full<00:02:52.400> influence<00:02:52.970> of

press G I should have full influence of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.870 
press G I should have full influence of

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
this back down to the root bone okay or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.570 
this back down to the root bone okay or
if<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.120> grab<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.870> I<00:02:59.930> press<00:03:00.200> G<00:03:00.590> notice

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
if I grab this and I press G notice

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.300 
if I grab this and I press G notice
there's<00:03:01.819> hardly<00:03:02.810> any<00:03:03.110> influence<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:04.040> this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
there's hardly any influence like this

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.190 
there's hardly any influence like this
right<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.940> that's<00:03:05.300> because<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.900> chain

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
right and that's because the chain

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.059 
right and that's because the chain
length<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:08.170> will<00:03:09.170> go<00:03:09.319> look<00:03:09.590> at<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.680> here

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
length of this will go look at it here

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.820 
length of this will go look at it here
is<00:03:10.269> zero<00:03:11.269> zero<00:03:11.750> meaning<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.200> chain<00:03:12.470> is

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
is zero zero meaning the chain is

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.890 
is zero zero meaning the chain is
influenced<00:03:13.370> back<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> root<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.720> if<00:03:14.810> I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
influenced back to the root so if I

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.600 
influenced back to the root so if I
change<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.410> just<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.860> say<00:03:16.989> three<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.610> press

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
change this just to say three and press

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.670 
change this just to say three and press
G<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.450> chain<00:03:20.690> length<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.079> only<00:03:21.230> back<00:03:21.500> to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
G then the chain length is only back to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.979 
G then the chain length is only back to
that<00:03:21.860> point<00:03:22.130> all<00:03:22.640> right<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.000> then<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.780> one

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
that point all right and then this one

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.539 
that point all right and then this one
actually<00:03:24.290> would<00:03:24.650> work<00:03:24.860> G<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.459> would

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
actually would work G that would

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.170 
actually would work G that would
influence<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.269> from<00:03:26.840> there<00:03:27.019> down<00:03:27.549> alright<00:03:28.549> so

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
influence it from there down alright so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.490 
influence it from there down alright so
but<00:03:29.690> what<00:03:29.840> they're<00:03:29.989> doing<00:03:30.019> they're

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
but what they're doing they're

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.580 
but what they're doing they're
individually<00:03:31.430> influencing<00:03:32.329> different<00:03:33.290> parts

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
individually influencing different parts

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.229 
individually influencing different parts
of<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> mesh<00:03:33.980> they<00:03:34.430> don't<00:03:34.610> really<00:03:34.850> know<00:03:35.090> about

each other per se one is you know one

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.599 
each other per se one is you know one
gets<00:03:38.660> evaluated<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.500> then<00:03:39.980> another<00:03:40.310> one<00:03:40.459> gets

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
gets evaluated and then another one gets

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.890 
gets evaluated and then another one gets
evaluated<00:03:41.109> all<00:03:42.109> right<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.560> however<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:43.900> really

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
evaluated all right so however a really

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.449 
evaluated all right so however a really
powerful<00:03:45.140> new<00:03:45.560> tool<00:03:45.829> and<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.160> don't<00:03:46.220> know<00:03:46.370> how

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
powerful new tool and I don't know how

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.370 
powerful new tool and I don't know how
new<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.760> is<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:47.450> do<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.660> me<00:03:47.750> because<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.079> haven't

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
new it is to do to me because I haven't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.750 
new it is to do to me because I haven't
I<00:03:48.440> only<00:03:48.709> discovered<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.220> recently<00:03:49.579> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
I only discovered it recently and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.160 
I only discovered it recently and
finally<00:03:50.060> read<00:03:50.299> through<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.600> manual<00:03:50.750> in

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
finally read through the manual in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.410 
finally read through the manual in
detail<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:52.519> figure<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.790> out<00:03:52.880> it's<00:03:53.150> kind<00:03:53.329> of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
detail to figure it out it's kind of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.229 
detail to figure it out it's kind of
tricky<00:03:53.750> but<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.590> keep<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.370> from<00:03:55.700> not<00:03:55.880> being<00:03:56.090> so

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
tricky but to keep it from not being so

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.520 
tricky but to keep it from not being so
tricky<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.630> just<00:03:56.780> gonna<00:03:56.870> show<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:57.440> you

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
tricky I'm just gonna show you so you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.990 
tricky I'm just gonna show you so you
know<00:03:57.620> how<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.739> spend<00:03:57.980> all<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.220> time<00:03:58.400> doing<00:03:58.670> it

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
know how to spend all the time doing it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.300

of<00:04:14.090> university<00:04:15.049> overseas<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:16.120> mean<00:04:17.120> I'm<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:17.720> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
of university overseas I mean I'm in the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.190 
of university overseas I mean I'm in the
United<00:04:18.049> States<00:04:18.289> and<00:04:18.530> then<00:04:19.419> it's<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:20.840> really

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
United States and then it's it's really

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.930 
United States and then it's it's really
powerful<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:21.859> what<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.159> does<00:04:22.430> basically

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
powerful and so what it does basically

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.470 
powerful and so what it does basically
what

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
what

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.510 
what
scene<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:23.990> that<00:04:24.260> if<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.740> go<00:04:24.950> back<00:04:25.160> here<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.490> I

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
scene is that if I go back here and I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.990 
scene is that if I go back here and I
change<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.270> chain<00:04:26.660> back<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.650> zero<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:28.850> it's

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
change this chain back to zero so it's

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.440 
change this chain back to zero so it's
influences<00:04:29.810> back<00:04:30.020> down<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.740> here<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.460> then<00:04:32.360> I

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
influences back down to here and then I

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.270 
influences back down to here and then I
move<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.780> with<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.230> cake<00:04:33.530> constraint<00:04:34.070> G

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
move it with this I cake constraint G

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.560 
move it with this I cake constraint G
now<00:04:35.180> notice<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.840> motion<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:37.570> through

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
now notice the motion is through

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.870 
now notice the motion is through
everything<00:04:39.080> but<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.860> other<00:04:40.130> bone<00:04:40.430> now<00:04:40.640> has

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
everything but this other bone now has

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.030 
everything but this other bone now has
an<00:04:41.090> influence<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.870> you'll<00:04:42.380> see<00:04:42.590> now<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:42.950> I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
an influence and you'll see now if I

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.100 
an influence and you'll see now if I
move<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:43.490> before<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.330> had<00:04:44.540> no<00:04:44.720> influence

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
move this before this had no influence

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.470 
move this before this had no influence
because<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.830> was<00:04:46.040> control<00:04:46.790> to<00:04:46.940> change<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.420> it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
because this was control to change so it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.090 
because this was control to change so it
was<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.720> evaluate<00:04:48.170> evaluated<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.920> or

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
was the evaluate evaluated that or

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.300 
was the evaluate evaluated that or
evaluated<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:50.900> press<00:04:51.350> this<00:04:51.650> notice

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
evaluated that so I press this notice

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.050 
evaluated that so I press this notice
this<00:04:52.490> does<00:04:52.850> now<00:04:53.120> have<00:04:53.260> influence<00:04:54.260> as<00:04:54.500> well<00:04:55.060> so

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
this does now have influence as well so

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.880 
this does now have influence as well so
basically<00:04:56.240> what's<00:04:56.660> happening<00:04:57.140> if<00:04:57.710> I've

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
basically what's happening if I've

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.800 
basically what's happening if I've
interpreted<00:04:58.400> the<00:04:58.640> manual<00:04:58.970> correctly<00:04:59.450> is<00:04:59.570> that

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
interpreted the manual correctly is that

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.400 
interpreted the manual correctly is that
it's<00:05:00.490> resolving<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.240> cake<00:05:02.690> constraints<00:05:03.260> or

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
it's resolving the I cake constraints or

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.520 
it's resolving the I cake constraints or
both<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.890> these<00:05:04.630> simultaneously<00:05:05.630> or<00:05:05.810> as

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
both of these simultaneously or as

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.590 
both of these simultaneously or as
number<00:05:06.920> as<00:05:07.640> many<00:05:07.940> number<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.240> constraints

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
number as many number of constraints

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.140 
number as many number of constraints
that<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:08.900> might<00:05:09.110> have<00:05:09.350> set<00:05:10.250> as<00:05:10.490> well<00:05:10.700> whereas

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
that you might have set as well whereas

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150 
that you might have set as well whereas
the<00:05:11.720> other<00:05:11.870> one<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.620> other<00:05:12.710> method<00:05:13.040> the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
the other one the other method the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.190 
the other one the other method the
traditional<00:05:13.640> sauvages<00:05:14.120> evaluates<00:05:14.720> this<00:05:14.990> one

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
traditional sauvages evaluates this one

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.370 
traditional sauvages evaluates this one
and<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.760> evaluates<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.840> one<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.290> then

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
and then it evaluates this one and then

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.930 
and then it evaluates this one and then
that<00:05:18.560> would<00:05:18.710> override<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.310> evaluation<00:05:19.880> of

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
that would override the evaluation of

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.090 
that would override the evaluation of
that<00:05:20.000> one<00:05:20.240> so<00:05:20.390> this<00:05:20.690> allows<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.170> to<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:21.410> much

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
that one so this allows you to have much

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
that one so this allows you to have much
more<00:05:22.310> control<00:05:22.880> on<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:24.550> on<00:05:25.550> your<00:05:25.730> armature

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
more control on the on your armature

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.760 
more control on the on your armature
I<00:05:26.240> mean<00:05:26.450> I've<00:05:26.810> experimented<00:05:27.410> with<00:05:27.560> some

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
I mean I've experimented with some

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.010 
I mean I've experimented with some
really<00:05:28.100> cool<00:05:28.550> effects<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.600> get<00:05:29.840> that

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
really cool effects that you get that

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.760 
really cool effects that you get that
absolutely<00:05:30.860> cannot<00:05:31.220> do<00:05:31.520> with<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
absolutely cannot do with the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.200 
absolutely cannot do with the
traditional<00:05:33.770> solver<00:05:34.220> alright<00:05:34.640> so<00:05:35.030> I'll<00:05:35.120> let

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
traditional solver alright so I'll let

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.210 
traditional solver alright so I'll let
you<00:05:35.330> experiment<00:05:35.720> with<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.290> see<00:05:36.440> what<00:05:37.010> you

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
you experiment with it and see what you

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.130 
you experiment with it and see what you
can<00:05:37.340> find<00:05:37.580> but<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.760> assure<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.150> it's<00:05:38.540> really

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
can find but I assure you it's really

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.320 
can find but I assure you it's really
powerful<00:05:39.740> it's<00:05:40.370> powerful<00:05:40.790> enough<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.150> the

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
powerful it's powerful enough to the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.430 
powerful it's powerful enough to the
point<00:05:41.570> where<00:05:42.040> I<00:05:43.390> basically<00:05:44.390> just<00:05:44.750> don't<00:05:45.260> use

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
point where I basically just don't use

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.500 
point where I basically just don't use
the<00:05:45.680> standard<00:05:46.100> solver<00:05:46.490> now<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:46.910> use<00:05:47.270> this

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
the standard solver now I use this

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.050 
the standard solver now I use this
solver<00:05:47.930> only<00:05:48.320> all<00:05:48.590> right<00:05:48.650> so<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.700> hope<00:05:49.880> that

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
solver only all right so I hope that

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.190 
solver only all right so I hope that
gives<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.300> little<00:05:50.390> bit<00:05:50.570> of<00:05:50.630> insight<00:05:50.960> and

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
gives you a little bit of insight and

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.730 
gives you a little bit of insight and
hope<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.160> find<00:05:52.370> some<00:05:52.640> cool<00:05:53.000> useful<00:05:53.750> things<00:05:54.530> to

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
hope you find some cool useful things to

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.050 
hope you find some cool useful things to
do<00:05:54.830> with<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.070> because<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.400> assure<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.670> I<00:05:55.820> have

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
do with it because I assure you I have

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.090 
do with it because I assure you I have
alright<00:05:56.570> well<00:05:56.900> that's<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.140> for<00:05:57.260> now<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.590> I'll

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
alright well that's it for now and I'll

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.910 
alright well that's it for now and I'll
see<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.310> in<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.430> next<00:05:58.640> lesson
