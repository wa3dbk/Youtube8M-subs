00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 good to all I come to bring you today a 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.740
 video let's hope this deck that is 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.600
 the one that facilitated me recently and since it's 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.430
 the only copy and he gave it to me as well 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.100
 I say I 'm going to make a video and we're going 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.579
 I'm going to teach it is a deck of bercy 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.869
 what's his name? 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.630
 we had one previously that the mining 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.279
 of tattoo 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.079
 and this is a little bit different 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.610
 pretty wave I've seen it and it has 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.520
 liked a lot 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.770
 it's a bit 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.360
 ordered since life where is more 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.930
 teach the letters a little the typical 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.470
 of advertising that brings basic 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.690
 facebook another game that you are pointing 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.760
 the story a little bit of the people that 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.010
 has created the deck what are the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 tattooists let's say then that did not have 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.170
 link expiration upside down but you'll see 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.830
 better these would be the two yo kers that 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.150
 they make it easy for us that we are the ones who 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.150
 they come from this one 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.860
 from the dossiers are there by the way 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.090
 he showed it to us in the back 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.740
 of all the letters 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.070
 what would be the cover of the club tattoo 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.460
 It is very very currada is more entitled 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 you are from joaquin you can see them 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 with that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.070
 taught a little more this would be the 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.130
 first would be ace of spades the part of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.049
 the spades and then in the background all 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.560
 these here carry what would be all 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.030
 the pikes carry a skull in the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.520
 your background 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 what is most highlighted some are 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.700
 hectic and striking are the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.250
 figures the figures are a pass in 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.860
 this case the spades so that the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.400
 You can see the school tour again 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.400
 are 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.740
 in this case the jota that would be this 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.450
 what would this skull here the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.670
 attack would be the king those who wish 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.869
 blanca la vera is great it is very 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.700
 pimp 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.709
 the next point let's not say would be the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.730
 hearts because we're going to get all of 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.390
 which I think will be a little better 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.510
 in this case, you have the problem 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 is mother and then after all the rest 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.650
 inside 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.620
 in this case, taking a boat is everything 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 put on all the cards is pretty 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.290
 web and the latest figures that are in 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170
 this case are also inspired as 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.489
 a little anchor you have here the jack 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.250
 would be then come from here is like a 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.829
 ballerina could not say exactly and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.599
 the king has shown himself very loving are 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.290
 you can but seen love is 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.000
 very well then the terrors would come 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.590
 we put the national order pica 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 I write is and before not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.250
 this would be the clovers also a type 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.310
 skull 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.740
 and with some roses of color life is the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.530
 same similar image is what is in 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.750
 the background of all the letters we have 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.300
 each one of them and then the three 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.600
 figures are also skulls in this 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.069
 case and this would be the one jot of a 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.110
 little flamenco 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.150
 then the q is very very currado also 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.910
 a woman who act even the detail 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.239
 of the in front of you the trouble this 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.700
 is cured and achieves here also with the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.670
 with the tattooed dragon 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.640
 is in solitude and then the last thing 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.040
 it is fine is that it is a tattoo of 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.730
 like fish inspired by christie's is 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.290
 stretched and good is to appear all the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.120
 letters as a kind of sphinx not 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.700
 I would know very well if it is Mayan type 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 texas or some of this but you have not read it 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.630
 exactly the logic that was done before 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 he has not read it completely basic to what 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.620
 better makes an indication are all 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.989
 same as you see 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.950
 the three figures are a little like 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.110
 as china figures appear or japan 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.630
 I guess it looks like what the hotal would be 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.000
 like a demon 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.330
 do you achieve 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.800
 like a Japanese looks like a hairstyle 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.390
 I'm very important I think that what 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.640
 that fills the other's relationships maybe 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.350
 what are the criticisms of there and its because 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.160
 Japan is also good as there is a 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.490
 samurai let's say that good because they are like 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.410
 two groups inspired by diagonal afa the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.320
 human facet for saying something and the others 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.970
 are skulls and tobacconists is that if 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.380
 you see them all like that I'm going to put here for 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.270
 that what is a little bit is going to be done 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.380
 long video and then something is generated but 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.720
 good 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.250
 I love you sir because the truth is that 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.360
 I liked it a lot 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.100
 Attention 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.449
 If I put the letters I do not know if he left me 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.139
 some but that is not 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.629
 but no 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.810
 because these are a little bit all 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:58.030
 figures that we have a little bit the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.939
 departures and honestly the truth is that 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.379
 we have only one copy but it has 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.870
 really liked the truth is that the 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.539
 I was looking and here I like this 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.879
 kind of tattoos stuff and a lot of 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:14.080
 these look like they look like letters from 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:17.830
 tarot misplaced so it's so cool it's 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.069
 much the truth and nothing because this is all 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:25.090
 for today's video I hope you have 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:28.680
 liked and not because we see each other in a 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.680
 next good video 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.990
 if the advertising of the letter that 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.260
 washington now see you later 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.260
 goodbye
