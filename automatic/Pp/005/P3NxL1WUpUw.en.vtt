many<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.420> don't<00:03:58.510> know<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.810> don't<00:03:58.930> know

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
many of you don't know that I don't know

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.000 
many of you don't know that I don't know
if<00:03:59.109> I've<00:03:59.170> mentioned<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.709> my<00:03:59.799> previous

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
if I've mentioned it in my previous

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.670 
if I've mentioned it in my previous
videos<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:00.519> I'm<00:04:00.609> a<00:04:00.639> huge<00:04:00.909> fan<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.470> pillar

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
videos but I'm a huge fan of the pillar

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.679 
videos but I'm a huge fan of the pillar
design<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.069> think<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.579> it's<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.510> much

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
design I think that it's it's much

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.500 
design I think that it's it's much
easier<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.079> clean<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.819> looks<00:04:07.060> nicer<00:04:07.480> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
easier to clean and it looks nicer and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.619 
easier to clean and it looks nicer and
also<00:04:07.900> helps<00:04:08.079> with<00:04:08.169> weight<00:04:08.319> reduction<00:04:08.379> and<00:04:09.629> it

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
also helps with weight reduction and it

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.780 
also helps with weight reduction and it
allows<00:04:10.930> more<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.439> like<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.889> flow<00:04:12.189> through<00:04:12.400> for

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
allows more of a like a flow through for

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.849 
allows more of a like a flow through for
water<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.359> different<00:04:13.689> materials<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
water and different materials that you

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.310 
water and different materials that you
might<00:04:15.069> encounter<00:04:15.370> when<00:04:15.639> using<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.030> knife<00:04:16.320> this

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320
