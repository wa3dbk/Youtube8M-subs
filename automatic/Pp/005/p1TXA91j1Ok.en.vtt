select passwords that are easy for us to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
select passwords that are easy for us to
remember<00:00:33.500> but<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> strong

Abby<00:02:22.459> 35<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.780> let's<00:02:23.930> crack<00:02:24.170> two<00:02:24.380> passwords<00:02:24.650> so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
Abby 35 so let's crack two passwords so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.150 
Abby 35 so let's crack two passwords so
far<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.519> it's<00:02:25.610> only<00:02:25.730> 35<00:02:26.269> seconds<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.799> you<00:02:30.950> can

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
so I hope this has been enlightening

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.100 
so I hope this has been enlightening
little<00:05:15.729> educational<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.779> hope<00:05:16.930> it's

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
little educational and I hope it's

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.600 
little educational and I hope it's
helped<00:05:17.379> you<00:05:17.469> to<00:05:17.710> reconsider<00:05:18.069> the<00:05:18.400> use<00:05:18.430> of

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
helped you to reconsider the use of

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.480 
helped you to reconsider the use of
strong<00:05:19.300> passwords<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.710> unfortunate<00:05:21.460> that

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
strong passwords it's unfortunate that

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.820 
strong passwords it's unfortunate that
some<00:05:21.849> of<00:05:21.969> us<00:05:22.120> will<00:05:22.330> wait<00:05:22.569> to<00:05:22.900> lose<00:05:23.169> or<00:05:23.469> get<00:05:23.740> our

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
some of us will wait to lose or get our

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.529 
some of us will wait to lose or get our
accounts<00:05:24.430> compromised<00:05:25.120> or<00:05:25.240> even<00:05:25.449> as

accounts compromised or even as
administrators<00:05:26.169> have<00:05:26.680> our<00:05:26.830> whole<00:05:26.949> systems

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
administrators have our whole systems

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.999 
administrators have our whole systems
compromised<00:05:28.029> before<00:05:28.569> we<00:05:28.779> start<00:05:29.590> enforcing

compromised before we start enforcing

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.279 
compromised before we start enforcing
the<00:05:30.639> use<00:05:30.879> of<00:05:31.120> stronger<00:05:31.659> passwords<00:05:32.080> again

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
the use of stronger passwords again

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.580 
the use of stronger passwords again
thank<00:05:33.219> you<00:05:33.279> very<00:05:33.430> much
