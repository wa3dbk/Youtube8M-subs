00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.339 
of the best spots to go to there's a
classroom<00:03:25.360> edition<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.019> one<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.260> we

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
classroom edition like the one that we

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.619 
classroom edition like the one that we
saw<00:03:26.379> in<00:03:26.530> better<00:03:26.830> them<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.250> there's<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.849> 30<00:03:28.150> 40

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
saw in better them and there's a 30 40

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.059 
saw in better them and there's a 30 40
to<00:03:28.720> 50<00:03:28.959> computers<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.590> there's<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.860> decent

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
to 50 computers so there's a decent

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.339 
to 50 computers so there's a decent
decent<00:03:30.819> amount<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.660> don't<00:03:31.870> have<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.200> go<00:03:32.290> to

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
decent amount so you don't have to go to

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.680 
decent amount so you don't have to go to
David<00:03:32.650> Lawrence<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:34.060> an<00:03:34.209> escalator

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
David Lawrence this is just an escalator

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
now we are in the cathedral computer lab

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.339 
now we are in the cathedral computer lab
and<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.909> actually<00:03:45.060> nice<00:03:45.420> because<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:46.049> two
