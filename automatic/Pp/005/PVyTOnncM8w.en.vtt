00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.090
 and go directly to the list 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.220

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.170
 emails 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 In this case, we have a desktop 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.500
 which on this phone is called 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.360

 the day is over the desktop can be 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.400

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.750

 the train disappeared and as we see completely 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.610
 changed icons 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.790
 instead of the message folder two at once 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.500

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.939
 much more like 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.560
 here is found the musical 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.170
 whose player is in work 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.469
 No mode, I put on the claim of alpha networks 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.719
 All these modes are flexibly configured through 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.039
 main screen menu 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.359
 You can customize as one such comrades 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.849
 if for some reason not 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.600
 satisfied with the name of the regime 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.059
 they can be changed

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.169

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.679
 in this case the hospital regime 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.609
 as i was showing this music player 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.199
 top horizontally named 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.029
 here we are talking about a vertical list 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.059
 language can also be chosen with such 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.229

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.309
 mode switching icons 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.549
 if you wish, you can also remove 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.729
 and replace any application 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.549
 Astana mode switch through 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.769
 menu 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.809
 here you can install almost any 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.129
 menu item 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.489
 any installed offers 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.529
 very comfortably 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.579
 interesting for each mode you can 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.649
 choose your theme 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.539
 really after work 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.539
 day switch modes 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.689
 we deliver business overboard smartphone 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.459
 tuned to serve as center 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.779
 entertainment 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.069
 and during working hours 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.809
 in the morning, the current affairs were already switched 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.449
 not a music player or 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.599
 video player 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.619
 so here is one device 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.729
 inside almost hiding 2 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.389
 personalization is displayed on 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.929
 completely new level 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.409
 perhaps in the future of such desktops 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.659
 there will be more 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.489
 although there is hardly any need 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.449
 but the potential of such a decision is very
