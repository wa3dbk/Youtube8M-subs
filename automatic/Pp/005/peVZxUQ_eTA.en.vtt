00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.410
A bird takes off, and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.250
A kitten chases after it, but

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.990
It’s claws don’t reach,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540
Such matches are useless.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.440
Its wings burst into flame, and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.300
The depths of the earth seen looking back are

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.070
Unquenchable by water,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.790
Such water is useless.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.950
The cage in which you’re captured, and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.310
The constructed void are

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.070
For whose sake?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.880
You can’t leave.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.600
The key that you searched for,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.430
The freedom that you wished for, are

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.150
For whose sake?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.140
Your own.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.720
Inside that cage with you alone comes

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.410
An expanding, filling red darkness.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.710
You raise your voice, but before anyone realizes,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.800
No one can tell anything was ever there before.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.090
Ah~

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.790
Back and forth, back and forth

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.610
I raise the conflagration

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.290
Around and round, around and round

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.220
I spin the wheels

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.850
It looks like you lost

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.780
Your limbs somewhere;

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.340
Don’t worry about that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.020
Just come with me.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.960
These burning flames

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.810
Erase without even leaving ashes

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.470
If you give up on your

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.370
Memories and vestiges

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.050
You’ll disappear

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.830
Without leaving even a breeze

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.350
You have a single destination,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.910
The ends of Hell.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.390
Plunged into flame,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.070
Someone becomes a sacrifice

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.000
When submerging,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640
Someone’s life is put on the line.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.170
If you force your intentions,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.230
You won’t return to unconsciousness.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.670
If you force consideration,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.820
You won’t return to freedom.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.860
After you acknowledge it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.950
There’s no turning back.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.630
Ah~

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.150
Back and forth, back and forth

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
I raise the conflagration

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.820
Around and round, around and round

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.670
I spin the wheels

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.310
It looks like you lost

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.220
Your limbs somewhere;

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.860
Don’t worry about that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.490
Just come with me.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.340
Back and forth, back and forth

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.200
I raise the conflagration

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.970
Around and round, around and round

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.770
I spin the wheels

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.470
You’ll disappear

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.290
Without leaving even a breeze

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.920
You have a single destination,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920
The ends of Hell.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.490
Back and forth, back and forth

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.410
I raise the conflagration

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.060
Around and round, around and round

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.900
I spin the wheels

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.570
Don’t look back upon your

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.470
Memories and vestiges

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.770
You’ve already left your heart behind somewhere.
