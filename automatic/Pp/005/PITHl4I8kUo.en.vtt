00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.940 
studio as we have discussed before it is
important<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.150> maintain<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.840> constant<00:00:13.410> size

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
important to maintain a constant size

make a good video if this is not done

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.060 
make a good video if this is not done
then<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> chance<00:00:21.689> remains<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> video

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
then the chance remains that the video

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.870 
then the chance remains that the video
either<00:00:23.310> becomes<00:00:24.090> hazy<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.810> unclear<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:26.130> there

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
either becomes hazy and unclear or there

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.859 
either becomes hazy and unclear or there
are<00:00:27.029> black<00:00:27.420> areas<00:00:27.960> surrounding<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.010> video

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
are black areas surrounding the video

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.540 
are black areas surrounding the video
neither<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> good<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.769> wave<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:33.920> ok<00:00:34.920> here

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.429 

let<00:01:20.729> me<00:01:20.880> check<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> dimensions<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.290> video

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
let me check the dimensions of the video

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.940 
let me check the dimensions of the video
in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> project<00:01:23.460> properties<00:01:26.210> it's<00:01:27.210> 600<00:01:28.200> x<00:01:28.350> 450

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
in the project properties it's 600 x 450

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.819 
in the project properties it's 600 x 450
pixels<00:01:29.509> which<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> same<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.480 
pixels which is the same as that of the
image<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.509> video<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.200> come<00:01:34.470> good<00:01:34.710> I
