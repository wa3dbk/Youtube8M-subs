00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
going to show you to do is how to cool

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
going to show you to do is how to cool
down<00:00:25.980> your<00:00:26.130> boiler<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.449> go

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
down your boiler so that you can go

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.150 
down your boiler so that you can go
ahead<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.900> make<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> shot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> espresso<00:00:28.560> and

ahead and make a shot of espresso and
what<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> does<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.029> kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.240> cuts<00:00:30.480> down<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
what it does it kind of cuts down the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.870 
what it does it kind of cuts down the
time<00:00:31.199> between<00:00:31.410> brewing<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.099> steaming<00:00:32.130> we'll

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
time between brewing and steaming we'll

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
time between brewing and steaming we'll
show<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.050> second

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
iron all the way and what I want to do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
iron all the way and what I want to do
is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.549> milk<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> increase<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is the milk is going to increase in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
is the milk is going to increase in
volume<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.860> want

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
volume and what I want to do is I want

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
volume and what I want to do is I want
to<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.280> slowly<00:01:11.640> lower<00:01:12.060> my<00:01:12.270> pitcher<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to kind of slowly lower my pitcher to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
to kind of slowly lower my pitcher to
compensate<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> milk<00:01:14.369> increasing<00:01:14.909> in

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
compensate for the milk increasing in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
compensate for the milk increasing in
volume<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.020> same<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.500> concentrating<00:01:17.250> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
volume at the same time concentrating so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.890 
volume at the same time concentrating so
I<00:01:17.400> don't<00:01:17.580> generate<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.210> bubbles<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
I don't generate big bubbles I want to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
I don't generate big bubbles I want to
create<00:01:19.080> microphone<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:20.490> cappuccino<00:01:21.360> so

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
activated the hot water button that of

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.709 
activated the hot water button that of
course<00:03:01.500> turns<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.980> pump<00:03:02.219> on<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.969> pump<00:03:03.239> forces

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
course turns the pump on the pump forces

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.479 
course turns the pump on the pump forces
water<00:03:03.959> into<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.349> boiler<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.250> steam

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
water into the boiler then out the steam

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.880 
water into the boiler then out the steam
line<00:03:05.700> what<00:03:05.939> that<00:03:06.120> does<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.930> forces<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> steam

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
line what that does it forces the steam

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.589 
line what that does it forces the steam
that's<00:03:08.099> in<00:03:08.280> your<00:03:08.400> boiler<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.090> pushed<00:03:09.359> out

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
that's in your boiler to be pushed out

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.929 
that's in your boiler to be pushed out
putting<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.560> boy<00:03:10.739> more<00:03:11.040> cool<00:03:11.310> water<00:03:11.609> into<00:03:11.879> the

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
putting the boy more cool water into the

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.699 
putting the boy more cool water into the
boiler<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.689> I<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> go<00:03:13.019> ahead<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.290> brew<00:03:13.530> my

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
boiler so I can go ahead and brew my

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.740 
boiler so I can go ahead and brew my
shot<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.519> cuts<00:03:14.760> down<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:15.000> time<00:03:15.329> and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
shot this really cuts down the time and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.030 
shot this really cuts down the time and
of<00:03:15.810> course<00:03:16.049> like<00:03:16.200> any<00:03:16.379> good<00:03:16.560> cook<00:03:16.799> what<00:03:16.980> you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of course like any good cook what you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.380 
of course like any good cook what you
want<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.519> try<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.730> get<00:03:17.970> everything<00:03:18.209> done

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
want to do is try to get everything done

want to do is try to get everything done
about<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.900> same<00:03:19.109> time<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.129> going<00:03:20.310> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
about the same time and this is going to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.369 
about the same time and this is going to
be<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> quicker<00:03:20.760> way<00:03:20.879> to<00:03:21.000> get<00:03:21.239> down<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:22.139> to

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
be a quicker way to get down and get to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.050 
be a quicker way to get down and get to
brew<00:03:22.590> temperature<00:03:23.189> so<00:03:23.549> what<00:03:23.730> I've<00:03:23.819> done<00:03:24.000> is
