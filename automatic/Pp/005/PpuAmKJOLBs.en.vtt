like that because that's all subjective
and<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.579> depends<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> live

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
clay after that I went ahead and dried

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.249 
clay after that I went ahead and dried
it<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> applied<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.720> last<00:01:25.080> step<00:01:25.320> product<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
it and applied the last step product and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.890 
it and applied the last step product and
that's<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> prepped<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.880> foot

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:52.789 

now<00:01:35.900> I'm<00:01:36.049> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.229> do<00:01:36.440> some<00:01:36.680> sheeting

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.770 

you<00:01:53.799> can<00:01:53.950> see<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.310> protected<00:01:54.909> side<00:01:54.939> is<00:01:55.450> going

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
you can see the protected side is going

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can see the protected side is going
much<00:01:56.110> quicker<00:01:56.380> than<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:57.000> unprotected<00:01:58.000> side

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
much quicker than the unprotected side

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.459 
much quicker than the unprotected side
but<00:01:59.229> both<00:01:59.439> sides<00:01:59.799> definitely<00:02:00.579> are<00:02:00.700> sheeting

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
but both sides definitely are sheeting

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.319 
but both sides definitely are sheeting
so<00:02:02.469> I'm<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.189> go<00:02:03.310> ahead<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:03.670> try<00:02:03.819> testing

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
so I'm going to go ahead and try testing

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.419 
so I'm going to go ahead and try testing
on<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.750> other<00:02:04.899> side<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.710> see<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.039> there's<00:02:06.250> any

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
on the other side to see if there's any

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.699 
on the other side to see if there's any
difference<00:02:06.610> from<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.600> angle<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.289> was<00:02:08.530> using

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
difference from the angle I was using

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:35.130 
difference from the angle I was using
the<00:02:08.890> water<00:02:09.099> sheet<00:02:33.569> all<00:02:34.569> right<00:02:34.720> guys<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.110> just

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.690 
finished my sheeting test and if you can
see<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:40.180> seems<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:42.040> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
see here it actually seems like the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.319 
see here it actually seems like the
uncoated<00:02:43.269> side<00:02:43.720> left<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:45.010> lot<00:02:45.489> less<00:02:45.700> water<00:02:45.970> on

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
uncoated side left a lot less water on

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.860 
uncoated side left a lot less water on
the<00:02:46.540> surface<00:02:46.769> then<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.980> coated<00:02:48.340> side<00:02:48.870> which

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the surface then the coated side which

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.309 
the surface then the coated side which
is<00:02:50.049> really<00:02:50.440> confusing<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.760> me<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.910> guess<00:02:52.269> a

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
is really confusing to me I guess a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.470 
is really confusing to me I guess a
clean<00:02:53.319> surface<00:02:53.799> will<00:02:54.250> actually<00:02:54.790> sheet<00:02:55.090> water

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
clean surface will actually sheet water

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.460 
clean surface will actually sheet water
better<00:02:55.810> than<00:02:56.079> fusion<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.720> beading<00:02:59.350> is

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
better than fusion but the beading is

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.110 
better than fusion but the beading is
just<00:02:59.650> non-existent<00:02:59.829> on<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.700> left<00:03:00.910> side

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
just non-existent on the left side

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720 
just non-existent on the left side
versus<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.810> right<00:03:02.109> side<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.739> side<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
versus the right side this side the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.699 
versus the right side this side the
unprotected<00:03:04.389> sided<00:03:04.690> sheet<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.139> water<00:03:05.260> slower

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
unprotected sided sheet of water slower

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.030 
unprotected sided sheet of water slower
but<00:03:06.519> she<00:03:06.790> did<00:03:06.940> more<00:03:07.180> water<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.560> side<00:03:08.829> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
but she did more water this side the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.920 
but she did more water this side the
fusion<00:03:09.489> protected<00:03:10.000> side<00:03:10.180> she<00:03:10.540> did<00:03:10.690> water

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
fusion protected side she did water

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.270 
fusion protected side she did water
faster<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.609> didn't<00:03:12.940> sheet<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.299> much<00:03:13.480> water

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
faster but didn't sheet as much water

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300 
faster but didn't sheet as much water
