on twist and my locks i retested them
last<00:00:53.370> week<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.680> week<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.309> my

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
last week so I'm like one week into my

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
last week so I'm like one week into my
retwist<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.850> frisbee<00:01:00.210> but

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
retwist and it was a little frisbee but

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
retwist and it was a little frisbee but
not<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.550> figured<00:01:02.820> hey<00:01:02.940> why<00:01:03.270> not

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
