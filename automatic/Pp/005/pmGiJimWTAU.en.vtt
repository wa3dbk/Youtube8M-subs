going<00:00:23.540> to<00:00:23.599> do<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:23.869> I<00:00:24.079> was<00:00:25.070> really<00:00:25.340> interested

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
going to do it I was really interested

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.030 
going to do it I was really interested
in<00:00:25.759> Virtual<00:00:26.119> Reality<00:00:26.200> technologies<00:00:27.200> I<00:00:27.619> was<00:00:28.009> a

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
in Virtual Reality technologies I was a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.030 
in Virtual Reality technologies I was a
bit<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.340> hacker<00:00:28.550> modder<00:00:30.040> video-game

bit of a hacker modder video-game
enthusiasts<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:31.970> I<00:00:32.380> wanted<00:00:33.380> to<00:00:33.440> go<00:00:33.500> out<00:00:33.560> and

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
enthusiasts and I wanted to go out and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.290 
enthusiasts and I wanted to go out and
buy<00:00:33.829> something<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:34.520> all<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:34.970> headsets

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
buy something but all of the headsets

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.819 
buy something but all of the headsets
that<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.540> had<00:00:35.660> tried<00:00:35.899> I<00:00:35.960> said<00:00:36.350> these<00:00:36.559> aren't

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
that I had tried I said these aren't

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.290 
that I had tried I said these aren't
nearly<00:00:37.010> what<00:00:37.250> I'm<00:00:37.309> trying<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.609> do<00:00:37.789> so<00:00:38.090> i

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
nearly what I'm trying to do so i

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.910 
nearly what I'm trying to do so i
decided<00:00:39.050> i<00:00:39.170> was<00:00:39.289> going<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.500> have<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.620> try<00:00:39.859> and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
decided i was going to have to try and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.680 
decided i was going to have to try and
create<00:00:40.129> something<00:00:40.430> myself<00:00:40.699> I<00:00:41.210> didn't

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
create something myself I didn't

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.360 
create something myself I didn't
honestly<00:00:41.840> think<00:00:42.109> it<00:00:42.410> would<00:00:42.530> get<00:00:42.679> as<00:00:42.829> far<00:00:43.100> as<00:00:43.340> it

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
honestly think it would get as far as it

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.160 
honestly think it would get as far as it
did<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.699> was<00:00:43.760> just<00:00:43.820> kind<00:00:44.149> of<00:00:44.179> a<00:00:44.269> fun<00:00:44.480> hobby<00:00:44.719> to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
did it was just kind of a fun hobby to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.729 
did it was just kind of a fun hobby to
you<00:00:45.379> know<00:00:45.469> pound<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.370> for<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.850> little<00:00:47.030> bit<00:00:47.739> but

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
you know pound on for a little bit but

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.200 
you know pound on for a little bit but
after<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.100> while<00:00:49.219> I<00:00:49.280> realized<00:00:49.519> wow<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:49.969> know

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
after a while I realized wow you know

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.000 
after a while I realized wow you know
this<00:00:50.359> their<00:00:50.750> act<00:00:50.929> the<00:00:51.140> technology<00:00:51.620> really<00:00:51.769> is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
this their act the technology really is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.369 
this their act the technology really is
sufficiently<00:00:52.550> advanced<00:00:53.030> now<00:00:53.149> you<00:00:53.899> really<00:00:54.140> can

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
sufficiently advanced now you really can

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.619 
sufficiently advanced now you really can
make<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.859> pretty<00:00:55.309> decent<00:00:55.730> VR<00:00:56.030> device<00:00:56.300> very

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
make a pretty decent VR device very

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.200 
make a pretty decent VR device very
cheaply<00:00:56.989> out<00:00:57.230> of<00:00:57.379> off<00:00:57.499> of<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.739> shelf<00:00:57.920> parts

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
cheaply out of off of the shelf parts

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.610 
cheaply out of off of the shelf parts
and<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.390> result<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.749> that<00:00:59.809> was<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.170> rift<00:01:00.350> I

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
and the result of that was the rift I

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.869 
and the result of that was the rift I
mean<00:01:00.769> there's<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:01.010> lot<00:01:01.039> of<00:01:01.219> head-mounted

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
mean there's a lot of head-mounted

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.520 
mean there's a lot of head-mounted
displays<00:01:02.359> over<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.870> years<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.320> just

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
displays over the years that just

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.040 
displays over the years that just
haven't<00:01:03.800> been<00:01:03.890> successful<00:01:04.810> they've<00:01:05.810> been

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
haven't been successful they've been

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.770 
haven't been successful they've been
very<00:01:06.230> expensive<00:01:06.980> very<00:01:07.010> poor<00:01:07.730> in<00:01:08.090> quality<00:01:08.270> or

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
very expensive very poor in quality or

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.590 
very expensive very poor in quality or
both<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.830> think<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.550> main<00:01:10.880> difference<00:01:10.940> now<00:01:11.570> is

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
both I think the main difference now is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.630 
both I think the main difference now is
that<00:01:11.870> technology<00:01:12.620> is<00:01:12.650> finally<00:01:12.830> there<00:01:13.310> we<00:01:13.550> have

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that technology is finally there we have

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
that technology is finally there we have
very<00:01:13.820> high<00:01:13.880> density<00:01:14.420> mobile<00:01:14.690> displays<00:01:15.110> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
very high density mobile displays that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.800 
very high density mobile displays that
are<00:01:15.560> high<00:01:15.710> resolution<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:17.000> great<00:01:17.390> motion

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
are high resolution we have great motion

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.630 
are high resolution we have great motion

years<00:01:29.330> ago<00:01:29.480> so<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.290> for<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.560> first<00:01:30.740> time<00:01:30.950> in

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
years ago so that for the first time in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.630 
years ago so that for the first time in
history<00:01:31.310> VR<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:31.880> really<00:01:32.120> possible<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.660> do<00:01:32.810> well

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
history VR is really possible to do well

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.890 
history VR is really possible to do well
at<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.820> price<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.150> people<00:01:35.570> can<00:01:35.720> actually

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
at a price that people can actually

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.690 
at a price that people can actually
afford<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.130> took<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.370> lot<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.580> different

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
afford so it took a lot of different

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000 
afford so it took a lot of different
prototypes<00:01:38.270> along<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.020> way<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.200> get<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.860> where

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
prototypes along the way to get to where

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.610 
prototypes along the way to get to where
we<00:01:40.160> are<00:01:40.190> now<00:01:40.510> but<00:01:41.510> I<00:01:42.020> think<00:01:42.080> what<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.440> have

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
we are now but I think what we have

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.710 
we are now but I think what we have
right<00:01:42.800> now<00:01:42.860> is<00:01:43.220> probably<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.300> best<00:01:44.450> set<00:01:44.690> of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
right now is probably the best set of

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.390 
right now is probably the best set of
compromises<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.680> make<00:01:45.860> with<00:01:46.010> everything

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
compromises you can make with everything

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.160 
compromises you can make with everything
that's<00:01:46.550> available<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.120> market<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.930> was

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
that's available on the market I was

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.930 
that's available on the market I was
interested<00:01:48.680> in<00:01:48.710> 3d<00:01:49.100> before<00:01:49.460> it<00:01:49.610> was<00:01:49.700> cool

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
interested in 3d before it was cool

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240 
interested in 3d before it was cool
again<00:01:50.300> like<00:01:50.510> I<00:01:50.660> had<00:01:50.870> an<00:01:50.990> icy<00:01:51.320> 3d<00:01:51.650> monitor<00:01:51.890> I'd

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
again like I had an icy 3d monitor I'd

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.720 
again like I had an icy 3d monitor I'd
several<00:01:52.970> 3d<00:01:53.270> monitors<00:01:53.860> before<00:01:54.860> avatar<00:01:55.460> came

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
several 3d monitors before avatar came

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.520 
several 3d monitors before avatar came
out<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.120> made<00:01:56.270> everybody<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:56.780> 3d<00:01:57.170> was<00:01:57.380> new

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
out and made everybody think 3d was new

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.340 
out and made everybody think 3d was new
again<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.220> was<00:01:58.670> I'm<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.210> 3d<00:01:59.570> enthusiasts<00:02:00.170> as

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
again so I was I'm a 3d enthusiasts as

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.230 
again so I was I'm a 3d enthusiasts as
well<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:00.800> vr<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.400> just<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.820> totally

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
well but vr is just on a totally

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.170 
well but vr is just on a totally
different<00:02:02.270> level<00:02:02.570> from<00:02:02.810> 3d<00:02:03.440> 3d<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.940> cool

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
different level from 3d 3d is it's cool

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.540 
different level from 3d 3d is it's cool
but<00:02:05.480> it's<00:02:06.020> only<00:02:06.170> bringing<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.620> one<00:02:06.860> small

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
but it's only bringing you one small

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.070 
but it's only bringing you one small
piece<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.269> puzzle<00:02:08.599> where<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> whole

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
piece of the puzzle where is the whole

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.160 
piece of the puzzle where is the whole
goal<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.349> virtual<00:02:09.860> reality<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.550> try<00:02:10.789> and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
goal of virtual reality is to try and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.540 
goal of virtual reality is to try and
simulate<00:02:12.170> reality

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
simulate reality

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.400 
simulate reality
now<00:02:13.880> if<00:02:14.120> you're<00:02:14.330> making<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.750> virtual<00:02:15.050> reality

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
now if you're making a virtual reality

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.530 
now if you're making a virtual reality
device<00:02:15.650> 3d<00:02:16.100> isn't<00:02:16.490> another<00:02:16.700> feature<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.300> put

on the device it's a necessity to
replicating<00:02:19.850> reality<00:02:20.420> 3d<00:02:21.020> especially<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
again really come back and VR will be

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.980 
again really come back and VR will be
your<00:03:00.350> now<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.860> you'll<00:03:01.310> be<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:01.670> god<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.120> VR<00:03:02.690> VR

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
your now that you'll be the god of VR VR

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.870 
your now that you'll be the god of VR VR
is<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> total<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.160> said<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.490> totally

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
is a total like I said it's a totally

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.640 
is a total like I said it's a totally
different<00:03:04.910> set<00:03:05.390> of<00:03:05.510> technologies<00:03:05.810> because

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
different set of technologies because

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.170 
different set of technologies because
the<00:03:06.770> goal<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.160> different<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.610> goal<00:03:07.790> isn't<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the goal is different the goal isn't to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.330 
the goal is different the goal isn't to
try<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> add<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> feature<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.980> an<00:03:10.070> existing

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
try to add a feature to an existing

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.330 
try to add a feature to an existing
medium<00:03:10.940> like<00:03:11.180> film<00:03:11.540> or<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.500> know<00:03:12.620> gaming<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.310> a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
medium like film or you know gaming on a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.070 
medium like film or you know gaming on a
monitor<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.300> try<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.750> create<00:03:14.930> an

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
monitor it's to try and create an

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.770 
monitor it's to try and create an
entirely<00:03:15.410> new<00:03:15.590> medium<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.520> mediums<00:03:17.300> tend<00:03:17.660> to

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
entirely new medium so mediums tend to

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.890 
entirely new medium so mediums tend to
have<00:03:17.900> more<00:03:18.170> sticking<00:03:18.680> power<00:03:18.830> than<00:03:19.280> features

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
have more sticking power than features

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.190 
have more sticking power than features
so<00:03:20.900> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
so you

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.070 
so you
Savion<00:03:21.890> 3d<00:03:22.280> work<00:03:22.610> together<00:03:22.810> sacrifices<00:03:23.810> that

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
Savion 3d work together sacrifices that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.020 
Savion 3d work together sacrifices that
