00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 the game I really liked the new one that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 It has he 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.060
 handling of the ball by the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 Players physics is well 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.900
 independent does not come out as it is always 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.960
 same side and if it's more 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.439
 in real life and the terrain to be 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.530
 also the champion 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.250
 that weeks later and obviously the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.670
 jump is significant but let's say and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.629
 with respect to the nearest version 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.970
 which is 2014 if you see that the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.250
 difficulty because it increased for what already 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.350
 we were talking before and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.900
 that inaccuracy makes more 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.750
 realistic the game be the precision of 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.290
 you pass any movement with the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.989
 sticks if there is also for the shot the 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.580
 management of the powers and all that and I 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 they like the part that they give 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.869
 continues to play in the way that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
 players receive the ball and try to 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.100
 turn to follow the path the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.960
 what is the step 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.930
 favors a lot of games whether they are more 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.460
 fast too 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.619
 quite the majority white license the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 players you notice that now gets more 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.640
 in the game and they are no longer in charge 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.990
 simply to fulfill his role but 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.479
 they are more collaborators 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.329
 I think it's very good, I think that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.250
 players depending on the situation 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.409
 they try to move depending on energy 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 of parties the parents are more precise 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.030
 improve with respect 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.940
 the lilac trio also as the figure of 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.940
 players 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.620
 m 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.570
 those those details like outside 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.750
 favor the environment within a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.490
 match of 5 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.930
 the different characters that participate 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.370
 only the fans but the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.190
 collectors that are around the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.690
 field the cameramen the shadows of 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 them and as the value is 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.920
 moving they try to follow that too 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.650
 then that gives it one more touch 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.420
 television the same emotions that are 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.070
 pretty good for example when it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020
 he was going to run the penalties and he showed 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.290
 the camera from advertising within the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.640
 court I liked it pretty is animation 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.660
 also when the players leave the field 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.660
 it shows that it changes a lot 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.300
 well I think I do not have much in that 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.450
 but in this 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.880
 it's very real the graphics changed 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.720
 very much depending on the situation 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.620
 improve yourself make an expression 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.550
 and nothing is more real 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.420
 the player can not control the play 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.599
 who does not want to do 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.989
 it's totally I do not know I think it's already very 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.370
 complete where at this moment I do not see 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.370
 that adding would have to try more 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.269
 it is difficult to mount recommendations 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.250
 because they are always like giving something more 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.620
 of what awaits the player then 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.170
 Well, congratulate them and continue 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.879
 innovating in that in that gameplay what 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.870
 that really draws attention to the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.549
 players 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.310
 for those who are in competition as 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.290
 my colleagues then that attracts a lot 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.150
 the gameplay that continues to improve in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.920
 these players could quite that 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.379
 improve the intelligence of those those 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.480
 apparently they still do not take the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.010
 correct decisions and commit many 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560
 errors that can change their matches 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.540
 not good what regulations and some things 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 can some errors maybe like what 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.010
 were I want the players that you have 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.220
 made between themselves there are different 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.519
 gol situations is very cool to have 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.560
 that approach and even more prior to 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.049
 launch of the official game so now 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.079
 we are thus at the doors of two months of 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.780
 that is released and still so that 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.790
 approach and receive opinions the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.209
 feedback from the community is 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.209
 for whom 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.450
 I find it very interesting that they give us 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.230
 this opportunity to know the game 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.609
 before 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.680
 the producers know our opinion 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 and they do about the changes that have 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.639
 done so that if they were followed 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.310
 Thank you 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.400
 that we can interact and 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.770
 show 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.639
 us as players that we like 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.639
 attend this time 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.870
 I hope that with respect to the serves of 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.940
 band and corner shots can not be 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.620
 select another player apart from the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.580
 that are stable so you can not 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.680
 make goals well as with some cheating 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.570
 if I'm in the corner normally with the 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.340
 kicker not always the central if it comes 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.800
 a player arrives but with this 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.240
 we can select another player and then 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.669
 send it to create where we want 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.550
 and the pk decides where he does not want to 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.710
 you feel and that's the same you did not like what 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.780
 who said when you say you did not like it before 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.520
 what the lynxes really want less 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.250
 that the between remain the same as the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.450
 previous normal one delivers them where 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.100
 want but can not be selected 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.350
 the player before the ball if 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.570
 well I noticed a change that has come 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.120
 the pair 14-15 is that from the day 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.400
 that you do not have to press lb ol 2 for 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.810
 make plays with the butt from this 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.669
 the leaves can no longer be chained 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.430
 it's so fast then when he tried 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.080
 make a play immediately tried 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.150
 make a different one the game no longer 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.130
 I kind of like that he does not receive it but that 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.820
 I keep doing a double and normal you can 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.210
 make the second move 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.040
 I almost all the fact of being able to cheat 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.720
 several grapes one after the other and already 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.170
 it can not be done to the way that I 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.000
 I used to say to overtake a player 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.050
 advance a defense with forward and 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.390
 now I can not do it now 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.590
 when I make the first move I try 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.540
 do the second and thinking takes away the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.770
 ball because it can not be you do not see it 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.910
 it is unreal 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.830
 in real life that happens not like then 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.550
 I think there's no sea and it's called 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.550
 ronaldo can do it
