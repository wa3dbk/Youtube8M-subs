lacing<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.820> I'm<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.540> sure<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.990> should

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
lacing so I'm not sure if I should

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.440 
lacing so I'm not sure if I should
release<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.530> or<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.070> that's<00:02:29.910> basically

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
release it or not and that's basically

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.600 
release it or not and that's basically
