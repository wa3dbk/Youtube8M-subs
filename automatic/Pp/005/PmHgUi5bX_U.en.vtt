so the spot putty has been put on this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.309 
so the spot putty has been put on this
angle<00:01:24.329> right<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:26.850> other<00:01:27.240> angle<00:01:27.509> right

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
angle right here this other angle right

here and this third angle right down
here<00:01:31.649> you<00:01:32.459> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.789> start<00:01:33.380> with<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.679> angle

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
here you want to start with one angle

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.830 
here you want to start with one angle
and<00:01:36.770> as<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.819> down<00:01:38.969> with<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.270> spot<00:01:39.539> funny<00:01:39.810> i

bit<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> circles<00:01:44.099> in<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:45.359> have<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:45.659> remember

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
bit of circles in it we have to remember

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.410 
bit of circles in it we have to remember
that<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:47.009> reason<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.429> put<00:01:47.609> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> gray<00:01:48.119> right

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that the reason I put on the gray right

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.209 
that the reason I put on the gray right
here<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:50.189> once<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.969> reach<00:01:51.209> your<00:01:51.539> base

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
here is that once you reach your base

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.249 
here is that once you reach your base
plastic<00:01:53.219> right<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.239> write<00:01:55.079> down

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
plastic right down here and write down

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.529

here you've already gone too deep the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.910 
here you've already gone too deep the

all<00:02:15.510> has<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> different<00:02:17.840> rate<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:19.109> which<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
all has a different rate at which the

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.490 
all has a different rate at which the
sandpaper<00:02:20.250> eats<00:02:20.579> through<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> if<00:02:22.290> we're

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
sandpaper eats through it so if we're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.740 
sandpaper eats through it so if we're
eating<00:02:22.859> through<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:24.109> putty<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.510> base

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
eating through the putty and the base

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.199 
eating through the putty and the base
plastic<00:02:28.410> what's<00:02:29.220> happening<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> spot

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
plastic what's happening is the spot

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.530 
plastic what's happening is the spot
putty<00:02:30.480> will<00:02:30.750> dish<00:02:31.230> out<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> same<00:02:33.389> with

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
putty will dish out that's the same with

angle which is very easy to do you're

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.140 
angle which is very easy to do you're
going<00:02:58.410> damn<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.400> not<00:02:59.519> getting<00:02:59.760> done<00:02:59.819> it's

halfway done ok don't worry about it go
to<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.480> different<00:03:09.660> angle<00:03:10.109> go<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.680> angle

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
to a different angle go to this angle

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.050 
to a different angle go to this angle
right<00:03:11.700> here<00:03:12.620> ok<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.829> if<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.430> doesn't

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
right here ok and if this one doesn't

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.599 
right here ok and if this one doesn't
seem<00:03:15.359> like<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.690> getting<00:03:15.840> done<00:03:16.169> then<00:03:17.099> move<00:03:17.430> on

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
seem like it's getting done then move on

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.819 
seem like it's getting done then move on
to<00:03:17.760> another<00:03:17.910> angle<00:03:18.359> or<00:03:19.139> move<00:03:19.379> on<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.739> another

to another angle or move on to another
part<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.549> then<00:03:21.540> come<00:03:21.810> back<00:03:21.889> come<00:03:22.889> back<00:03:22.919> and

part and then come back come back and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.150 
part and then come back come back and
slowly<00:03:23.730> fine-tune<00:03:24.480> your<00:03:24.510> work<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.859> remember

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
slowly fine-tune your work and remember

slowly fine-tune your work and remember
if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.699> have<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:26.970> low<00:03:27.600> spot<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.169> here<00:03:28.500> which

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
if you have a low spot in here which

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.170 
if you have a low spot in here which
which<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.280> will<00:03:29.459> have

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
which you will have

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.360 
which you will have
you<00:03:30.750> may<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.319> apply<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.590> three<00:03:32.040> four<00:03:32.310> or

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you may have to apply this three four or

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.809 
you may have to apply this three four or
five<00:03:32.519> times<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.140> low<00:03:34.349> spot

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
five times but if you have a low spot

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.449 
five times but if you have a low spot
don't<00:03:35.819> worry<00:03:36.030> about<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:37.620> fine<00:03:37.950> tune<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
don't worry about it just fine tune the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.369 
don't worry about it just fine tune the
edges<00:03:38.819> get<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.629> as<00:03:40.609> just<00:03:41.609> as<00:03:41.819> smooth<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.510> you

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
edges get it as just as smooth as you

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.509 
edges get it as just as smooth as you
can<00:03:43.680> before<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.760> put<00:03:44.939> on<00:03:45.060> your<00:03:45.269> next<00:03:46.370> coat<00:03:47.370> of

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
can before you put on your next coat of

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.660 
can before you put on your next coat of
putty<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.799> remember<00:03:49.799> less<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.069> more<00:03:50.430> with

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
putty and remember less is more with

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.229 
putty and remember less is more with
this<00:03:50.790> stuff<00:03:51.379> because<00:03:52.379> as<00:03:53.069> your<00:03:53.579> remember

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
this stuff because as your remember

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.059 
this stuff because as your remember
we're<00:03:54.420> think<00:03:55.139> about<00:03:55.349> it<00:03:55.469> like<00:03:55.680> putting

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
we're think about it like putting

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.429 
we're think about it like putting
concrete<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:57.540> plastic<00:03:58.019> right<00:03:58.170> here

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
concrete on this plastic right here

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.890 
concrete on this plastic right here
we're<00:03:58.829> sanding<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> concrete<00:04:00.060> down<00:04:00.239> but

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
we're sanding the concrete down but

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.539 
we're sanding the concrete down but
we're<00:04:01.049> also<00:04:01.260> sanding<00:04:02.010> off<00:04:03.379> original<00:04:04.549> material

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
we're also sanding off original material

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.449 
we're also sanding off original material
off<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.209> project<00:04:06.810> whatever<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.799> project<00:04:08.280> is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
off the project whatever the project is

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.179 
off the project whatever the project is
and<00:04:09.109> when<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:10.379> that<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:10.709> creating<00:04:10.980> a

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
and when you do that you're creating a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.990 
and when you do that you're creating a
low<00:04:11.400> spot<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:13.560> they<00:04:14.220> could<00:04:14.430> think<00:04:14.639> of<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.849> as

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
low spot so they could think of it as

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.270 
low spot so they could think of it as
being<00:04:15.900> an<00:04:16.079> artist<00:04:17.720> take<00:04:18.720> your<00:04:18.840> 800<00:04:19.259> grit<00:04:19.440> go

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
being an artist take your 800 grit go

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360 
being an artist take your 800 grit go
over<00:04:20.759> it<00:04:20.910> load<00:04:21.810> your<00:04:21.959> paper<00:04:22.199> up<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:23.190> is

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
over it load your paper up this is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.029 
over it load your paper up this is
what's<00:04:23.580> called<00:04:23.789> loading<00:04:24.210> up<00:04:24.389> it's<00:04:25.020> where<00:04:25.349> you

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
what's called loading up it's where you

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.890 
what's called loading up it's where you
have<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.880> lot<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:29.220> material<00:04:29.789> either<00:04:30.270> primer

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
have a lot of the material either primer

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.170 
have a lot of the material either primer
or<00:04:31.639> mud<00:04:32.639> or<00:04:33.800> spot<00:04:34.800> putty<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.310> then<00:04:35.789> we<00:04:35.940> take<00:04:36.120> it

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
or mud or spot putty and then we take it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.879 
or mud or spot putty and then we take it
over<00:04:37.010> let<00:04:38.010> me<00:04:38.130> clean<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:39.289> see<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.620> will

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
over let me clean it see and that will

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.140 
over let me clean it see and that will
come<00:04:41.070> on<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:42.349> every<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:43.560> often<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.280> want<00:04:45.060> it

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
come on and every so often you want it

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.290 
come on and every so often you want it
as<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.690> get<00:04:45.840> water<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.260> here<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.889> you<00:04:47.300> load

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
as you get water on here and you load
