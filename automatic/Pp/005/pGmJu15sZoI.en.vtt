Mercruiser but what it does is is

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.779 
Mercruiser but what it does is is
actually<00:04:46.509> X<00:04:47.259> much<00:04:47.440> more<00:04:47.620> like<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.770> car<00:04:48.039> motor<00:04:48.520> it

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
actually X much more like a car motor it

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.339 
actually X much more like a car motor it
keeps<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.270> lake<00:04:49.570> water<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.050> your<00:04:50.199> motor

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
keeps the lake water out of your motor

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.540 
keeps the lake water out of your motor
and<00:04:50.500> cools<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.039> motor<00:04:51.190> with<00:04:51.340> antifreeze

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
and cools the motor with antifreeze

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.670 
and cools the motor with antifreeze
which<00:04:51.940> gives<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> much<00:04:52.720> lung<00:04:53.229> jeopardy<00:04:53.590> out

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
which gives you a much lung jeopardy out

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.689 
which gives you a much lung jeopardy out
of<00:04:53.770> motor<00:04:53.919> well<00:04:54.160> that's<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.400> good<00:04:54.520> point

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
of motor well that's a good point

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.640 
of motor well that's a good point
because<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.300> think<00:04:55.419> most<00:04:55.690> people<00:04:55.870> usually<00:04:56.530> only

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
because I think most people usually only

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.830 
because I think most people usually only
get<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.949> for<00:04:57.099> saltwater<00:04:57.550> but<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.509> also<00:04:58.720> a
