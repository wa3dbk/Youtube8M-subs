00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.370 
the problems beginning painters have is
a<00:02:55.640> dry<00:02:56.640> brushing<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.390> how<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.110> work<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.890> proper

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
a dry brushing and how to work up proper

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.630 
a dry brushing and how to work up proper
ratios<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.410> color<00:03:01.980> uh<00:03:03.140> when<00:03:04.140> they're<00:03:04.640> painting

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
ratios of color uh when they're painting

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.800 
ratios of color uh when they're painting
their<00:03:05.880> minis<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> great

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
their minis so this is this is a great

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.550 
their minis so this is this is a great
way<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.019> jump<00:03:10.440> right<00:03:10.800> over<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.310> stage<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
way to jump right over that stage and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.610 
way to jump right over that stage and
give<00:03:13.560> those<00:03:13.769> colors<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> nice<00:03:14.640> transition

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
give those colors a nice transition

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.140 
give those colors a nice transition
level<00:03:16.620> without<00:03:17.450> having<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.660> learn<00:03:20.150> any

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
level without having to learn any

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.310 
level without having to learn any
advanced<00:03:21.930> painting<00:03:22.200> techniques<00:03:22.489> whatsoever

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
advanced painting techniques whatsoever

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.990 
advanced painting techniques whatsoever
so<00:03:25.910> it's<00:03:26.930> covering<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.200> pretty<00:03:29.130> nicely<00:03:29.400> it's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
so it's covering it pretty nicely it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.630 
so it's covering it pretty nicely it's
it's<00:03:30.360> going<00:03:30.690> into<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.019> grooves<00:03:31.320> real<00:03:31.709> well<00:03:31.980> um

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.509 

now<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:36.030> know<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.570> like<00:03:36.780> dipping<00:03:37.290> shake<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.980> I

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
now I know it's like dipping shake and I

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.520 
now I know it's like dipping shake and I
can't<00:03:38.880> shake<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.640> don't<00:03:41.700> know<00:03:42.239> if<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
can't shake this so I don't know if the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.940 
can't shake this so I don't know if the
additional<00:03:44.340> amounts<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.359> going<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.049> be<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
additional amounts are going to be a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.400 
additional amounts are going to be a
problem<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:48.930> going<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.109> be<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> little
