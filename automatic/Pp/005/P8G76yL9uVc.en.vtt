 hello friends welcome to the channel paint 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.890
 with marta this is a tutorial channel 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.370
 of drawing paint for all 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.370
 levels 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.930
 let's see the mixes to make three 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.349
 colors one is pink the pink more 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.009
 typical or a kind of gum rose the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.770
 pink stick also called old rose and 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.199
 the salmon color that is a bit color 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.800
 halfway between the rose and the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.800
 orange 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.629
 to make the face we can use two 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.629
 magenta or red colors 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.840
 we throw magenta 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.240
 I'm going to throw here red 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 well it was a bit dry this red but 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.960
 no matter 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.989
 and we turn white 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.890
 we just mix white and magenta and 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.310
 depending on the amount of white that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.009
 let's take o from the amount of magenta we 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.009
 it is lighter or darker 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.900
 the same thing happens if we do with the red 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.530
 we also get the flavors that this one 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.530
 it's dry 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 and you can see that the shade of pink is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.670
 different if we do it with red that yes 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.430
 we do it with magenta is a nuance 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 different but the two are pink 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.960
 to make the rose stick we have to use 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.150
 magenta not red magenta white and a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.440
 very small whit of black 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.440
 lets go see it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.410
 we take white 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.289
 we take magenta 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.690
 we would get a rose just like what 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.000
 we have done before and we give 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.000
 a little bit just a little 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.100
 until we see that we get the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.100
 tone that we want 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.020
 you see it 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.130
 we can make it lighter darker 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.280
 and there we have the pink rose or old rose 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.239
 to make the salmon color we take 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.239
 magenta 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.870
 we add white that is, we make a 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.480
 pink as we had done before 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.480
 we add yellow it has been 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.349
 too much orange I give a little more 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.349
 from magenta 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.579
 a little more white 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.870
 you see salmon color 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.870
 and this is all up to the eye
