 they resolve fighting because the 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.170
 intention of this program was these 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.689

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.669
 silvio mora that invites a tro of people and 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.800
 is the heavy category the people who 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:17.339
