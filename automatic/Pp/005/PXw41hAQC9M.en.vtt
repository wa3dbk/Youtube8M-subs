00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the scooter and you'll activate a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.169 
the scooter and you'll activate a
mission<00:00:12.650> this<00:00:13.650> mission<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> real<00:00:14.370> pain<00:00:14.700> but

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
mission this mission is a real pain but

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.450 
mission this mission is a real pain but
there's<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.660> slightly<00:00:16.500> logical<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.160> get

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
there's a slightly logical way to get

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.480 
there's a slightly logical way to get
round<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> I'll<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:19.130> it<00:00:20.130> may<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.430> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
round it and I'll do it it may not be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.820 
round it and I'll do it it may not be
the<00:00:20.699> best<00:00:20.730> way<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the best way but I think it is this is a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:32.680 
the best way but I think it is this is a
really<00:00:23.070> good<00:00:23.189> way<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:30.650> look<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.130> one

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
really good way so look at these one

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
really good way so look at these one
