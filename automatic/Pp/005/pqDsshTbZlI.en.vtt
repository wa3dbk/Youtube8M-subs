00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
did the spray arm normally spins this

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.380 
did the spray arm normally spins this
direction<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:29.929> I<00:01:30.580> drilled<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.700> little<00:01:32.090> hole<00:01:32.270> on

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
direction so I drilled a little hole on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.630 
direction so I drilled a little hole on
this<00:01:32.720> end<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:33.649> a<00:01:33.830> sixteenth<00:01:34.250> inch<00:01:34.429> hole

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
this end it's just a sixteenth inch hole

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.540 
this end it's just a sixteenth inch hole
and<00:01:34.880> one<00:01:35.690> on<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:35.960> end<00:01:36.229> just<00:01:36.550> little

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
and one on this end just little

00:01:37.550 --> 00:02:20.750 
and one on this end just little
application<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:38.119> Newton's<00:01:38.300> third<00:01:38.570> law

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:35.809 

you

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.849 

and<00:02:37.250> find<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.670> middle<00:02:38.909> one

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
and find that the middle one

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.170 
and find that the middle one
it's<00:02:40.859> not<00:02:41.069> okay

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
it's not okay

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's not okay
spring<00:02:43.540> water<00:02:43.689> way<00:02:44.819> top<00:02:45.819> ones

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:03:03.199 

go<00:02:48.640> ahead<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.880> cancel<00:02:49.090> this

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.509
