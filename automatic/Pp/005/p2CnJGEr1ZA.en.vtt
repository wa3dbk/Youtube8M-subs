similar looking dragon through our

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.240 
similar looking dragon through our
playthrough<00:00:36.469> however<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> mod<00:00:38.010> there's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
playthrough however with the mod there's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.860 
playthrough however with the mod there's
just<00:00:38.430> under<00:00:38.550> 400<00:00:39.149> million<00:00:39.540> different

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
just under 400 million different

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.290 
just under 400 million different
variations<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.579> works<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.940> by<00:00:42.059> using

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
variations the way it works is by using

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
variations the way it works is by using
shaders<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> colour<00:00:43.140> parts<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> dragon

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
shaders to colour parts of the dragon

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
shaders to colour parts of the dragon
separately<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> rest<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> body<00:00:45.300> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
separately from the rest of the body so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.209 
separately from the rest of the body so
you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.770> splitting<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
you can think of it as splitting a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.560 
you can think of it as splitting a
dragon's<00:00:47.550> body<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.910> colouring<00:00:48.450> them

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
dragon's body up colouring them

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.700 
dragon's body up colouring them
separately<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.289> putting<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.680> back

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
separately and then putting it back

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.920 
separately and then putting it back
together<00:00:49.950> again<00:00:50.370> before<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> spawns<00:00:51.090> it's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
together again before it spawns it's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270 
together again before it spawns it's
also<00:00:52.140> being<00:00:52.440> done<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> avoid

with the Dragons power inabilities he
also<00:02:17.460> wants<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.910> add<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> random<00:02:18.450> element<00:02:18.540> to

I<00:02:21.030> imagine<00:02:21.840> these<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.140> only<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.440> slight

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I imagine these will only be slight

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.200 
I imagine these will only be slight
variants<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.550> you'll<00:02:23.670> still<00:02:23.820> add<00:02:23.970> quite<00:02:24.150> a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
variants but you'll still add quite a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.540 
variants but you'll still add quite a
bit<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.600> randomness<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.550> overall

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
bit to the randomness to be all overall

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
before it reaches its full potential but

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.010 
before it reaches its full potential but
we<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.940> its<00:02:39.120> current<00:02:39.390> state<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.720> enough<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
we think its current state is enough to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.630 
we think its current state is enough to
