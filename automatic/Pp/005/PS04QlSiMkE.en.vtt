pink lip gloss and comparing it to the
concealer<00:02:44.210> you<00:02:44.480> see<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:44.810> almost<00:02:45.080> like<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
concealer you see it's almost like the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.470 
concealer you see it's almost like the
same<00:02:46.070> packaging<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.330> why<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
same packaging so that's why the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690 
same packaging so that's why the
concealer<00:02:48.170> looks<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.770> lip<00:02:49.100> gloss<00:02:49.130> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
concealer looks like a lip gloss and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.090 
concealer looks like a lip gloss and
let's<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.390> top<00:02:50.690> off<00:02:50.720> our<00:02:50.990> lips<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.980> we

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
let's just top off our lips so here we

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.060 
let's just top off our lips so here we
are<00:02:55.130> full<00:02:55.640> face<00:02:55.970> makeup<00:02:56.600> from<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.470> distance<00:02:57.860> I

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
are full face makeup from a distance I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.050 
are full face makeup from a distance I
think<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.370> looks<00:02:58.550> great

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
think it looks great

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.930 
think it looks great
flawless<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.260> if<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.500> look<00:03:00.710> up<00:03:00.950> close<00:03:00.980> you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
flawless but if you look up close you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.270 
flawless but if you look up close you
can<00:03:01.970> actually<00:03:02.150> see<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.320> dry<00:03:03.620> spots<00:03:04.010> on<00:03:04.250> my

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
can actually see the dry spots on my

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.510 
can actually see the dry spots on my
skin<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.420> can't<00:03:05.690> stress<00:03:05.990> enough<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:07.160> sure

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
skin so I can't stress enough to be sure

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.410 
skin so I can't stress enough to be sure
to<00:03:07.790> moisturize<00:03:08.560> before<00:03:09.560> applying<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.970> stick

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.930 
to moisturize before applying the stick
foundation<00:03:12.200> other<00:03:13.190> than<00:03:13.490> that<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.760> think

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
foundation other than that I think

bad you know my foundation looks the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.190 
bad you know my foundation looks the
same<00:03:32.690> from<00:03:33.110> when<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.590> left<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.610> actually<00:03:35.390> is

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
same from when I left it actually is

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.510 
same from when I left it actually is
still<00:03:36.680> dry<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:38.240> creases<00:03:38.570> of<00:03:38.960> my<00:03:39.140> nose<00:03:39.520> the

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
still dry in the creases of my nose the

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.210 
still dry in the creases of my nose the
cream<00:03:40.790> eyeshadow<00:03:41.390> did<00:03:42.050> crease<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.620> applied<00:03:43.040> it

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
cream eyeshadow did crease I applied it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.510 
cream eyeshadow did crease I applied it
with<00:03:43.370> nothing<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.680> figured<00:03:46.100> since<00:03:46.130> I

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
with nothing on but I figured since I

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.430 
with nothing on but I figured since I
blended<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.150> out<00:03:47.330> pretty<00:03:47.690> well<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.290> would

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
blended it out pretty well it would

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.130 
blended it out pretty well it would
increase<00:03:48.710> but<00:03:49.490> yet<00:03:49.820> next<00:03:50.000> time<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.300> do<00:03:50.480> use<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.110> I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
increase but yet next time I do use it I

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.930 
increase but yet next time I do use it I
will<00:03:51.410> put<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> primer<00:03:51.980> underneath

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
will put a primer underneath

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.180 
will put a primer underneath
I<00:03:52.970> think<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.870> blush<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.350> bronzer<00:03:54.800> stayed<00:03:55.040> on

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
I think the blush and bronzer stayed on

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.550 
I think the blush and bronzer stayed on
pretty<00:03:55.520> well<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.180> am<00:03:56.420> very<00:03:56.840> impressed<00:03:57.080> by<00:03:57.500> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
pretty well I am very impressed by the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.400 
pretty well I am very impressed by the
lip<00:03:57.890> products<00:03:58.370> because<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.180> had<00:03:59.570> lunch<00:03:59.870> earlier

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
lip products because I had lunch earlier

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.730 
lip products because I had lunch earlier
and<00:04:00.770> I<00:04:01.400> dabbed<00:04:02.060> my<00:04:02.540> lips<00:04:02.810> several<00:04:03.200> times<00:04:03.500> with

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
and I dabbed my lips several times with

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.980 
and I dabbed my lips several times with
napkin<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.880> saw<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.120> color<00:04:05.420> transfer

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
napkin and I saw the color transfer

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.660 
napkin and I saw the color transfer
though<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.320> was<00:04:06.620> expecting<00:04:07.280> there<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.460> be

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
though I was expecting there to be

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.330 
though I was expecting there to be
nothing<00:04:08.240> left<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:09.050> must<00:04:09.320> be<00:04:09.410> because<00:04:09.680> of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
nothing left but it must be because of

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.700 
nothing left but it must be because of
the<00:04:10.670> lip<00:04:11.330> liner<00:04:11.570> that<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> applied<00:04:12.200> on<00:04:12.380> prior

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
the lip liner that I applied on prior

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.430 
the lip liner that I applied on prior
you<00:04:13.490> can<00:04:13.670> still<00:04:14.000> see<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> lip<00:04:14.990> color<00:04:15.230> it's

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
you can still see a lip color it's

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.310 
you can still see a lip color it's
probably<00:04:15.980> not<00:04:16.190> as<00:04:16.370> potent<00:04:17.000> but<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:18.140> could

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
probably not as potent but you could

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.440 
probably not as potent but you could
still<00:04:18.470> see<00:04:18.650> color<00:04:18.920> there<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.460> I<00:04:20.000> think<00:04:20.090> that's

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
still see color there and I think that's

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.110 
still see color there and I think that's
about<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:21.890> will<00:04:22.280> check<00:04:22.550> back<00:04:22.580> at<00:04:23.000> the

pretty good
I<00:04:50.949> wouldn't<00:04:51.639> say<00:04:51.759> it's<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:52.120> best<00:04:52.539> drugstore

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
I wouldn't say it's the best drugstore

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.480 
I wouldn't say it's the best drugstore
makeup<00:04:53.680> lying<00:04:54.430> out<00:04:54.729> there<00:04:55.000> but<00:04:55.840> as<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.740> whole<00:04:57.190> I

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
makeup lying out there but as a whole I

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.969 
makeup lying out there but as a whole I
think<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.090> cosmetics<00:04:58.750> work<00:04:58.990> pretty<00:04:59.319> well<00:04:59.440> so

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
think the cosmetics work pretty well so

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.040 
think the cosmetics work pretty well so
the<00:05:00.129> eyeshadow<00:05:00.669> itself<00:05:01.210> stands<00:05:01.569> out<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.020> me

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
the eyeshadow itself stands out to me

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.809 
the eyeshadow itself stands out to me
because<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.440> love<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.889> color<00:05:03.129> I<00:05:03.219> think<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.610> goes

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
because I love the color I think it goes

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.010 
because I love the color I think it goes
on<00:05:04.030> beautifully<00:05:05.280> but<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.340> does<00:05:06.819> crease<00:05:07.449> you

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
on beautifully but it does crease you

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.629 
on beautifully but it does crease you
know<00:05:08.169> what<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.379> was<00:05:08.620> expecting<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.400> by<00:05:09.580> this

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
know what I was expecting it by this

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.610 
know what I was expecting it by this
time<00:05:09.879> to<00:05:10.840> crease<00:05:11.340> completely<00:05:12.340> white<00:05:13.169> up<00:05:14.169> here

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
time to crease completely white up here

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.999 
time to crease completely white up here
but<00:05:15.009> it<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:15.639> creased<00:05:16.599> a<00:05:16.810> little<00:05:17.169> bit<00:05:17.349> I<00:05:17.560> have

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
but it just creased a little bit I have

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.670 
but it just creased a little bit I have
an<00:05:18.250> oily<00:05:18.639> combination<00:05:18.879> t-zone<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:19.810> it

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
an oily combination t-zone and it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.360 
an oily combination t-zone and it
doesn't<00:05:21.190> look<00:05:21.419> oily<00:05:22.419> or<00:05:22.690> greasy<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:24.190> a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
doesn't look oily or greasy just a

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.550 
doesn't look oily or greasy just a
little<00:05:24.669> shiny<00:05:24.969> but<00:05:25.360> nothing<00:05:25.719> significant<00:05:26.409> and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
little shiny but nothing significant and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680 
little shiny but nothing significant and
lastly<00:05:27.219> the<00:05:27.430> lipstick<00:05:27.819> I<00:05:27.940> think<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.270> lipstick

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
lastly the lipstick I think the lipstick

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.850 
lastly the lipstick I think the lipstick
works<00:05:28.990> pretty<00:05:29.469> well

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
works pretty well

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.540 
works pretty well
I<00:05:30.219> liked<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.669> with<00:05:30.880> a<00:05:30.909> lip<00:05:31.180> liner<00:05:31.529> I<00:05:32.550> definitely

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
I liked it with a lip liner I definitely

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.189 
I liked it with a lip liner I definitely
would<00:05:33.759> like<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.120> try<00:05:34.360> different<00:05:34.419> colors<00:05:35.169> of

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
would like to try different colors of

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.050 
would like to try different colors of
the<00:05:35.409> lip<00:05:35.590> liner<00:05:35.800> because<00:05:36.159> that<00:05:36.340> particularly

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
the lip liner because that particularly

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.570 
the lip liner because that particularly
nude<00:05:37.569> I'm<00:05:37.750> not<00:05:37.930> too<00:05:38.169> fond<00:05:38.409> of<00:05:38.650> as<00:05:38.949> you<00:05:39.250> can<00:05:39.400> see

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
nude I'm not too fond of as you can see

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.580 
nude I'm not too fond of as you can see
it's<00:05:39.729> definitely<00:05:40.029> washed<00:05:40.690> off<00:05:40.990> but<00:05:41.349> I

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
it's definitely washed off but I

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.129 
it's definitely washed off but I
expected<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.490> because<00:05:42.909> it<00:05:43.150> didn't<00:05:43.539> claim<00:05:43.840> to

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
expected that because it didn't claim to

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.930 
expected that because it didn't claim to
be<00:05:44.259> a<00:05:44.289> long-lasting<00:05:44.560> or<00:05:45.219> anything<00:05:45.520> like<00:05:45.880> that

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
be a long-lasting or anything like that

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.519 
be a long-lasting or anything like that
overall<00:05:46.659> from<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.080> line<00:05:47.319> I<00:05:47.620> would<00:05:47.740> repurchase

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
overall from the line I would repurchase

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.550 
overall from the line I would repurchase
the<00:05:50.529> lipsticks<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:52.240> lip<00:05:52.419> liners<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.289> I

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
the lipsticks and the lip liners and I

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.339 
the lipsticks and the lip liners and I
would<00:05:53.800> repurchase<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.849> eyeshadows<00:05:55.509> as<00:05:55.719> long

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
would repurchase the eyeshadows as long

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.950 
would repurchase the eyeshadows as long
as<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.650> put<00:05:57.099> an<00:05:57.279> eyeshadow<00:05:57.610> primer<00:05:57.960> underneath

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
as I put an eyeshadow primer underneath

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.140 
as I put an eyeshadow primer underneath
it<00:05:59.440> my<00:05:59.560> least<00:05:59.889> favorite<00:06:00.039> would<00:06:00.520> have<00:06:00.550> to<00:06:00.759> be

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
it my least favorite would have to be

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.209 
it my least favorite would have to be
the<00:06:01.569> stick<00:06:01.870> foundation<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:02.770> think<00:06:03.099> the

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
the stick foundation I think the

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.390 
the stick foundation I think the
foundation<00:06:03.430> was<00:06:04.000> okay<00:06:04.449> I<00:06:04.479> just<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:05.139> didn't<00:06:06.099> like

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
foundation was okay I just I didn't like

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.209 
foundation was okay I just I didn't like
how<00:06:06.699> the<00:06:06.729> foundation<00:06:07.629> felt<00:06:08.009> especially<00:06:09.009> right

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
how the foundation felt especially right

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.159 
how the foundation felt especially right
when<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.430> put<00:06:09.520> it<00:06:09.819> on<00:06:09.969> it<00:06:10.150> just<00:06:10.360> felt<00:06:10.539> really<00:06:10.750> dry

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
when I put it on it just felt really dry

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.379
