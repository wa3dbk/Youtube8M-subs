00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.670
 Yes 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.599
 in hambach and you're happy to do this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.180
 video with me hi all this peace 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.470
 of man and attention bomba when 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.870
 will you months tip top 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.370
 despite a slight sore throat everything goes 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.280
 well from my side we find ourselves 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.870
 today for a new video a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.090
 little special counter strike 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.010
 as you know I play a lot at 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.050
 game and for me also fake 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.230
 because you always play the game 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.970
 exactly 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.620
 and you also always play to 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.620
 players and I thought it would be 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.629
 interesting to involve 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.650
 subscribers to participate precisely in the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.650
 50th 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.900
 oneapp shon of peace of malouas nacho des 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.530
 subscribers because I made 49 currently 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.780
 for this special 50th I will take the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.909
 three best actions in competitive 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.890
 on twitter its global offensive and we 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.440
 would do a little and said I would have a 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.060
 small fragmovie of subscribers the ideal is 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.830
 that it really needs to be 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.130
 actions that stand out in steps in 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.600
 ffa stuff in casuals so do 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.220
 something that really come out of the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.039
 lot because like that for lease will 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.719
 well you judge to do this when you 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.490
 have finished your competitive match 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.799
 you can look at it in the tab 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.649
 watch or atx in English and so 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.100
 download the demo and drink beautiful 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.170
 Highlights of this will help you more 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.719
 to know what you are doing right or wrong 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.179
 also what are you doing fake because 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.590
 that we must know what we do 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.289
 wrong when we die and it's a real 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 fight exactly as you know 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.219
 it is by watching oneself play that we 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.170
 learns to evolve well in the game if 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.820
 you too judged your action 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.240
 interesting to make a video 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.969
 sent there me on facebook or any 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.190
 witness exactly simply on 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.960
 twitter do not write to me though 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.910
 on youtube because the notes them 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.770
 notifications about on palatability a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.720
 come a little archaic and so he is 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.220
 impossible for me to see a message 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.040
 private I do not know how because 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 you have to click a million times and that 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.280
 not jump directly to the eyes 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.340
 you can copy the link by going 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.380
 in watch your table games 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.760
 scores and then all the way down there are 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 copy the code 1 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.460
 it must pierrot bomb she wanted 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.380
 say something yes copy the code 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.450
 the link is copied and so you can 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.880
 send it to me indicating of course 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.020
 where is the action is also to which 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 moment of the game 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.150
 that of course will avoid me from watching 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.400
 the whole demo is to save time 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.020
 to take the next action I think 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.080
 that it's a good way to make you 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.900
 participate and and and why not to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.240
 the future established this kind of practice 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.190
 most often so we can all 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.290
 admire to play so we can all 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.709
 to be together to see the counter 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.570
 strike 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.870
 moreover it also pushes you to 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.660
 play game 1 because pure jewel too 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.900
 so that must motivate you on my side 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.490
 I'm waiting, we're working impatiently and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.830
 I hope the three players who 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.090
 will pass on the chain will be motivated 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.810
 to make others for them 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.640
 next or action subscribers and that 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.470
 those who have unfortunately not been 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 selected for 7.50 m 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.660
 the ball might be later in 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.220
 another series from my side I hope that 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.510
 this video contest because we can 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.440
 to say it's a video contest to you 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.320
 will have pleased 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.630
 and I have to go out for the bottom 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.680
 because it is very beautiful outside there is 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.640
 roads to betou want to 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.730
