 I had to do it, but renan 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.300
 then it will disappear or second option 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.190
 I know you click on that second option and it's 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.380
 add a feature in what you say 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.060
 click add a resource going 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.150
 a dialog box appears asking 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.510
 if you want to buy the serial and have a 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 button named I already own serial 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.090
 so you will click he will transfer 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.000
 you automatically back to the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.730
 work and there you will get the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.020
 serial that you 're in your mail there and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.320
 will stick and will stay in 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.690
 This a hug he'll update the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.200
 system will restart the machine and when 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 pretty 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.790
 so there's the right tip to add 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.520
 a resource and remembering that it arrives here from 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 new 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.920
 add course 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.610
 right 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.670
 remembering to enable or disable the 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.820
 feature is for the active voice 7 feature 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.580
 your windows right 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.880
 This is not the case. Do not move. 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.900
 sure this is for those who understand the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.980
 that will disable what will you lanai and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.430

 a feature that you will add your 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.440
