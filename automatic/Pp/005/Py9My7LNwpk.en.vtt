but what he's going to do is he gonna

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
but what he's going to do is he gonna
walk<00:00:43.320> towards<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> middle<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> rest

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
walk towards the middle where the rest

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
walk towards the middle where the rest
of<00:00:44.610> his<00:00:44.670> team<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.090> after<00:00:45.539> shoving<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:45.989> top<00:00:46.230> lane

of his team is after shoving up top lane
and<00:00:46.590> clearing<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> Baron<00:00:47.219> vision<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.850> looks

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and clearing the Baron vision that looks

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
and clearing the Baron vision that looks
like<00:00:48.210> Apollo's<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:49.079> joining<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> main

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like Apollo's actually joining the main

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
like Apollo's actually joining the main
forces<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> team<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.120> ends<00:00:51.270> up

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
forces of the team so what ends up

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.819 
forces of the team so what ends up
happening<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> trap<00:00:51.989> wears<00:00:52.199> off<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
happening is the trap wears off as we

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
happening is the trap wears off as we
continue<00:00:53.190> rolling<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> replay<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.059> he's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
continue rolling the replay out he's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
continue rolling the replay out he's
gonna<00:00:54.539> walk<00:00:54.809> back<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.190> don't<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
gonna walk back up you don't know that

this is happening though if you're

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
this is happening though if you're
gravity<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.070> they're<00:00:59.250> gonna<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.640> turn

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
gravity so they're gonna actually turn

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.599 
gravity so they're gonna actually turn
it<00:01:00.390> around<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:01.050> straight<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.829> Baron<00:01:02.219> put

since<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.870> beat<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.620> gravity<00:03:08.040> kind<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
since we beat you know gravity kind of

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.370 
since we beat you know gravity kind of
decisiveness<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.290> pretty

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.680 
decisiveness not like that it was pretty
clean<00:03:10.680> i<00:03:10.709> guess<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.549> i<00:03:11.580> think<00:03:11.700> we'll<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.239> we'll

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
clean i guess so i think we'll be we'll

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.300 
clean i guess so i think we'll be we'll
have<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.840> good<00:03:12.959> shot<00:03:13.110> at<00:03:13.140> playoffs<00:03:13.350> agent<00:03:14.250> i

as good he said he did yeah he

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.170 
as good he said he did yeah he
definitely<00:03:34.440> stepped<00:03:35.130> up<00:03:35.310> having<00:03:35.640> played<00:03:35.880> both

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
definitely stepped up having played both

definitely stepped up having played both
support<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.109> mid<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:37.829> Apollo<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
know I have to imagine it helped a

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.870 
know I have to imagine it helped a
little<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> guys<00:03:41.519> had<00:03:41.670> at<00:03:41.790> least

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
little bit that you guys had at least

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.550 
little bit that you guys had at least
been<00:03:42.000> playing<00:03:42.359> with<00:03:42.540> gate<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.049> another<00:03:43.290> role

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
been playing with gate in another role

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.770 
been playing with gate in another role
but<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.799> at<00:03:44.010> least<00:03:44.130> had<00:03:44.760> him<00:03:45.000> around<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.570> team

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
but you at least had him around the team

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.090 
but you at least had him around the team
and<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.260> I've<00:03:46.500> been<00:03:46.620> playing<00:03:46.829> with<00:03:46.950> him

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and and I've been playing with him

and and I've been playing with him
coming<00:03:47.250> into<00:03:47.609> today<00:03:47.760> yeah<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.359> mean<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
coming into today yeah I mean it was it

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.599 
coming into today yeah I mean it was it
was<00:03:49.140> good<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:49.560> obviously<00:03:49.739> yeah<00:03:50.130> we<00:03:50.340> had<00:03:50.579> a

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
was good we obviously yeah we had a

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.280 
was good we obviously yeah we had a
little<00:03:50.910> bit<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.120> experience<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:51.870> still

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
little bit of experience but it's still

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.560 
little bit of experience but it's still
like<00:03:53.040> there's<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.310> much<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.180> many<00:03:54.359> things

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
like there's so much so many things

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.030 
like there's so much so many things
within<00:03:55.049> our<00:03:55.260> team<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.799> not<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
within our team because it's not the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.039 
within our team because it's not the
standard<00:03:56.340> communication<00:03:57.150> right<00:03:57.329> so<00:03:57.810> he<00:03:57.959> has

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
standard communication right so he has

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.210 
standard communication right so he has
to<00:03:58.170> learn<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> phrases<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.100> use

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
to learn like the phrases that we use

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.860 
to learn like the phrases that we use
like<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.730> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:03:59.970> lingo<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.420> we<00:04:00.660> talked

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
like the kind of lingo that we talked

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.780 
like the kind of lingo that we talked
with<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.340> takes<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.700> little

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
with so it just it just takes a little

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.970 
with so it just it just takes a little
bit<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:02.970> time<00:04:03.060> from<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.480> girl<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:04.230> what<00:04:04.890> would

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
bit of time from the girl now what would

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.960 
bit of time from the girl now what would
you<00:04:05.130> say<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.549> biggest<00:04:05.670> difference

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
you say would be the biggest difference

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.610 
you say would be the biggest difference
between<00:04:06.239> those<00:04:06.660> two<00:04:06.840> mid<00:04:06.989> laners<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.500> had

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
between those two mid laners if you had

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.199 
between those two mid laners if you had
to<00:04:07.769> say<00:04:07.920> bringing<00:04:08.310> gaida<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.760> what<00:04:08.910> changes

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
to say bringing gaida and what changes

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.849 
to say bringing gaida and what changes
in<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.690> dynamic<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.319> team<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:10.709> for

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
in the dynamic of the team here for

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.699 
in the dynamic of the team here for
impulse<00:04:11.160> um<00:04:12.200> it's<00:04:13.200> hard<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.470> tell<00:04:13.680> just

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
impulse um it's hard to tell just

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.229 
impulse um it's hard to tell just
because<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.310> haven't<00:04:14.489> played<00:04:14.639> with<00:04:14.760> him<00:04:14.850> too

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
because we haven't played with him too

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.360 
because we haven't played with him too
much<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.840> think<00:04:16.380> Jojo<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.799> definitely<00:04:17.190> stronger

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
much I think Jojo is definitely stronger

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.099 
much I think Jojo is definitely stronger
at<00:04:17.519> team<00:04:17.729> fighting<00:04:18.000> but<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.359> think<00:04:18.600> gates<00:04:18.900> like

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
at team fighting but I think gates like

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.300 
at team fighting but I think gates like
better<00:04:19.289> just<00:04:19.500> working<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.010> team<00:04:20.190> in

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
it like that and I think that what it we

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.540 
it like that and I think that what it we
know<00:05:44.380> what<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.620> would<00:05:44.710> ever<00:05:44.800> happen<00:05:44.889> on<00:05:45.310> coast
