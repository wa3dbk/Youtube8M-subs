 do not split the titanic in two that by 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.590
 up there I think if it's here 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.730
 this part will be starting but 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.730

 Nothing gives the same, they do not let the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.250
 Bogota 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.480

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.630
 there is nobody to those people who are dying 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.280
 anguish flavor of the other party but I 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.080
