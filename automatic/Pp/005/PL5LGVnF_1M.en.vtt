00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello again today I bring you broth 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.589
 res this delicious dish very famous 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.380
 in many countries without Guatemala for 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.870
 course is not left behind is a party 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.179
 of vegetables and meat that can not miss 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.970
 in any home and it's pretty 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.060
 simple to prepare let's start 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.490
 we need a leaflet of laurel we are going to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 use this is a bone that got 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 in the supermarket that said bone for 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 broth in guatemala know him also 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 like exposed bone and the meat can be 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.559
 beef rib post in this case 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630
 I'm using bolus I saw that because I 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.390
 I like that I do not have too much fat and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 can serve to make a delicious 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.010
 salpicÃ³n at the end if you want good 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 we preheat our pot and our 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.079
 meat we cut into smaller pieces 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.300
 and we are going to put them to dry very well 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.000
 because what we are going to do is that the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 let's seal before putting it to cook 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 in our preheated pot we put a 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.190
 half a teaspoon of oil only 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.519
 so that the meat will not stick 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 and when it is already hot we put 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.250
 our pieces of meat to seal 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.570
 As you can see, all we do is that the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.479
 we put and we turn them over 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.390
 immediately and we're going to let these 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.690
 mistakes for a moment nothing more and nothing 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.870
 plus 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.910
 to be red on the outside is not stitched 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.130
 We still completely add it 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.650
 onion and we let it continue to follow 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.180
 for a couple of minutes we add 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.800
 our bone and the laurel leaf 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.140
 now if we add the water I already 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.530
 I had the boiling water to plant 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.530
 a little the process 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 we put salt and let this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 cook over medium-high heat for about 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
 45 minutes an hour until it's okay 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.420
 cooked the meat meanwhile 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.659
 we prepare our vegetables here I am 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.149
 trying to peel a yucca realize 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.970
 the yucca really is easy to peel the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.369
 just that he has his little trick out there 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.740
 that you have to make an incision and then 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.319
 with the knife you do not have to cut it 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.390
 that simply go separating the shell 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.459
 all we do is make a little 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.249
 of pressure with the knife and leaves 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.230
 easily simply be careful of 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.989
 that we are not going to slip the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.849
 gay knife and they realize 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.200
 supervising it is necessary to be the 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.230
 cutting and it's easy to come out 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.239
 for new our elotes I here alone 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.099
 get what you say not like the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.080
 corn ears of guatemala so I 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.640
 I cook separately because of what 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.910
 otherwise this is what gives it a flavor 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 sweet to the broth that I do not like so 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.800
 that I prefer to sew them separately 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.190
 our flesh has already been known 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.440
 for more than 45 minutes so let's go 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.660
 to check that it is well cooked 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 we start to season with consume can 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 be consume of networks or consume of chicken 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.769
 which you have at hand and you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.049
 let's start adding the vegetables 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.440
 that are sewn with more time like cassava 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.829
 I also do not know how to marry cassava 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.640
 some places we add whiskey 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.680
 the chayote and the carrots and we're going to 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.220
 let them be cooked about 10 to 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.269
 15 minutes after that has passed 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.840
 weather 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:29.239
 Now let's add our 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.819
 and vegetables like the chicks the potatoes 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.250
 all these are cooked with much less 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.920
 time you need water we put you 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.099
 more water and let it cook 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.230
 for about 15 minutes and 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.049
 let's start checking to see if 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.569
 no these vegetables are already sewn for 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.390
 that we are not going to over sew because 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.630
 if it does not fall apart 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.069
 we check well and finally we're going to 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.069
 add the cabbage 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.860
 and something that if we add enough 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.680
 fresh cilantro this gave it the flavor 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.010
 that stands out in this broth so I 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.020
 we added a lot of coriander and 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.960
 we finish seasoning if you need 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.200
 bouillon if you need salt to 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.740
 we have a delicious broth and we eat 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.490
 fresh cilantro with onions for 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 can serve it and this broth is already 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.930
 ready we can serve you with our 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.050
 corn that are also ready by 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.560
 separately we put avocado rice 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.210
 lemon tortilla and it's delicious like that 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.010
