into pick out this headset and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.850 
into pick out this headset and
I<00:02:01.090> research<00:02:01.630> I'm<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.900> know<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.320> Amazon<00:02:02.830> I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
I research I'm you know the Amazon I

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710 
I research I'm you know the Amazon I
sorted<00:02:03.340> by<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.520> most<00:02:03.760> expensive<00:02:04.119> sanitizer

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
sorted by the most expensive sanitizer

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.469 
sorted by the most expensive sanitizer
and<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.380> chose<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.310> one<00:02:06.670> apparently<00:02:07.060> these

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
and I I chose this one apparently these

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.690 
and I I chose this one apparently these
things<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:08.080> lay<00:02:08.229> down<00:02:08.259> somehow<00:02:08.950> because<00:02:09.520> this

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
things can lay down somehow because this

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.730 
things can lay down somehow because this
is<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> very<00:02:10.090> thin<00:02:10.509> box<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:13.470> yeah<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> mean<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
is a very thin box and yeah I mean it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.710 
is a very thin box and yeah I mean it
looks<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> CD<00:02:15.520> holder<00:02:16.060> case<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.569> like<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
looks like a CD holder case it's like a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.130 
looks like a CD holder case it's like a
case<00:02:16.990> logic<00:02:17.350> or<00:02:17.800> something<00:02:21.750> probably<00:02:22.750> not<00:02:22.900> I

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
case logic or something probably not I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.540 
case logic or something probably not I
got<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> little<00:02:23.410> count<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.100> don't<00:02:24.220> let<00:02:24.310> me<00:02:24.430> go

snuff<00:02:30.010> oh<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.520> think<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.850> packaging<00:02:31.420> is

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
snuff oh I think this packaging is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.300 
snuff oh I think this packaging is
actually<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.260> rip<00:02:32.709> off<00:02:32.860> for<00:02:33.070> them<00:02:33.190> it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
actually kind of a rip off for them it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150 
actually kind of a rip off for them it
reduces<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.330> speed<00:02:34.600> link<00:02:34.780> Medusa's<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
reduces the speed link Medusa's and it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
reduces the speed link Medusa's and it
somehow<00:02:36.370> doesn't<00:02:36.489> seem<00:02:37.390> quite<00:02:37.600> as<00:02:37.750> sweet<00:02:38.110> when

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440

those<00:04:35.160> were<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.340> know<00:04:36.490> I'm<00:04:36.790> triple<00:04:37.210> yeah<00:04:37.419> this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
those were you know I'm triple yeah this

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.810 
those were you know I'm triple yeah this
has<00:04:38.050> like<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.380> braided<00:04:38.830> cable<00:04:39.310> stuff<00:04:39.580> that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
has like the braided cable stuff that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.909 
has like the braided cable stuff that
looks<00:04:39.940> pretty<00:04:40.120> nice<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.750> don't<00:04:41.440> think<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.800> the

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
looks pretty nice I don't think that the

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.930 
looks pretty nice I don't think that the
pc<00:04:42.250> 360<00:04:42.790> has<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.560> um<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:45.100> supposed<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.820> be

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
pc 360 has that um I supposed to be

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.030 
pc 360 has that um I supposed to be
better<00:04:46.150> than<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.720> table<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.169> stuff<00:04:47.470> yeah<00:04:47.800> it

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
better than the table and stuff yeah it

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.940 
better than the table and stuff yeah it
feels<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.310> lot<00:04:48.430> lighter<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:49.590> guess<00:04:50.590> I'll<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.919> to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
feels a lot lighter I guess I'll have to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.250 
feels a lot lighter I guess I'll have to
see<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.430> microphone<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.940> see<00:04:52.270> how<00:04:53.050> it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.860 
see on the microphone to see how it
compares<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.889> really<00:04:54.130> like<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.400> mic<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.970> pc

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
