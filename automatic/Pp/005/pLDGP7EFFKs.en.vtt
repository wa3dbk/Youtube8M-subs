need nothing else you need to buy to go

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
need nothing else you need to buy to go
with<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.790> comes<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> charger

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
with this just comes with the charger

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.930 
with this just comes with the charger
and<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.399> definitely<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and that's it which is definitely a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
and that's it which is definitely a
bonus<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> works<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.230> basis<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
bonus so this works on the basis of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.889 
bonus so this works on the basis of
emitting<00:00:47.129> heat<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> light<00:00:47.850> pulses<00:00:48.360> directly

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
emitting heat and light pulses directly

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
emitting heat and light pulses directly
to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> pimple<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.489> when

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.100 
to the pimple as you can see here when
you<00:00:51.510> press<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> button<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:53.539> light<00:00:54.539> flashes

you press the button the light flashes
and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.770> emits<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.309> little<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and it actually emits a little bit of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
and it actually emits a little bit of
heat<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:57.510> now<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> place<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
heat as well now you place this on the

say 81% reduction in under 24 hours and

say 81% reduction in under 24 hours and
the<00:01:29.040> product<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> expensive<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.630> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the product is expensive so when it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.090 
the product is expensive so when it's
claiming<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.320> something<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.770> would<00:01:31.950> hope

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
claiming to do something I would hope

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
claiming to do something I would hope
that<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.909> around<00:01:33.180> about

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that it would do it it's around about

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.440 
that it would do it it's around about
130<00:01:34.020> pounds<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> UK<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.159> 180<00:01:35.820> dollars<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
130 pounds in the UK and 180 dollars in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.130 
130 pounds in the UK and 180 dollars in
the<00:01:36.509> US<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.770> expensive<00:01:38.900> having<00:01:39.900> said

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the US so it is expensive having said

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.950 
the US so it is expensive having said
that<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.400> main<00:01:41.640> plus<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.570> using<00:01:42.869> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that I think the main plus in using this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.410 
that I think the main plus in using this
product<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> fact<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.700> stops<00:01:45.149> me

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
product is the fact that it stops me

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.319 
product is the fact that it stops me
wanting<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.110> squeeze<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:47.340> pick<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:48.000> spots

sometimes<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
sometimes you think when you get a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.020 
sometimes you think when you get a
pimple<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.920> pick<00:01:59.909> at

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
pimple you really really want to pick at

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
pimple you really really want to pick at
it<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.649> that's<00:02:01.649> probably<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.159> worst<00:02:02.340> thing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it and that's probably the worst thing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.410 
it and that's probably the worst thing
you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you can do to it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.569 
you can do to it
so<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> find<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> using<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.250> kind<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so I find it using this it kind of

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.029 
so I find it using this it kind of
enables<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.689> feel<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.469> you're<00:02:07.619> treating

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
enables you to feel like you're treating

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.139 
enables you to feel like you're treating
the<00:02:08.160> spot<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> you're<00:02:08.610> doing<00:02:08.789> something<00:02:08.970> good

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the spot and you're doing something good

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
the spot and you're doing something good
without<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.780> breaking<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.200> skin<00:02:10.440> which

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
without actually breaking the skin which

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.990 
without actually breaking the skin which
obviously<00:02:10.890> makes<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.340> pimple<00:02:11.640> last<00:02:11.819> for

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
obviously makes the pimple last for

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
obviously makes the pimple last for
longer<00:02:12.300> so

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
longer so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.750 
longer so
in<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> respect<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> really

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
in that respect I think this is really

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.690 
in that respect I think this is really
good<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.209> think<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.530> treat<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.280> pimple

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
good I do think if you treat the pimple

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.790 
good I do think if you treat the pimple
when<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.209> first<00:02:18.690> arising<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.560> when<00:02:19.680> it's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
when it is first arising like when it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.290 
when it is first arising like when it's
just<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> tiny<00:02:20.250> bump<00:02:20.520> under<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> skin<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
just a tiny bump under the skin if you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.780 
just a tiny bump under the skin if you
catch<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.860> think<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> reduces

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
catch it then then I do think it reduces

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.670 
catch it then then I do think it reduces
how<00:02:24.270> long<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> pimple<00:02:24.900> stays<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.380> how<00:02:25.470> big

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
how long the pimple stays and how big

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.260 
how long the pimple stays and how big
the<00:02:25.800> pimple<00:02:26.069> gets<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.910> makes

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the pimple gets I think it kind of makes

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.910 
the pimple gets I think it kind of makes
it<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.510> away<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.720> lot<00:02:27.900> faster<00:02:28.349> whereas<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.739> you

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it go away a lot faster whereas if you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.449 
it go away a lot faster whereas if you
try<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.580> treat<00:02:30.470> effectively<00:02:31.470> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> like

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
try and treat effectively kind of like

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.910 
try and treat effectively kind of like
full<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.239> spot<00:02:33.900> once<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.350> definitely

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
full on a spot once it's definitely

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.430 
full on a spot once it's definitely
arrived<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.550> your<00:02:35.670> face<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.630> don't<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.319> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
arrived on your face I don't think this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.500 
arrived on your face I don't think this
actually<00:02:37.709> works<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.580> extent<00:02:38.970> then<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
actually works to that extent then I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.030 
actually works to that extent then I
think<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> catch<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> spots<00:02:40.890> early

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
think you have to catch the spots early

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.059 
think you have to catch the spots early
if<00:02:41.610> you<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> mean

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
if you get what I mean

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.330 
if you get what I mean
so<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:45.030> all<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.510> think<00:02:45.569> that<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.920> product

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so all in all I think that this product

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.170 
so all in all I think that this product
does<00:02:47.580> work<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.959> doesn't<00:02:49.380> work<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.640> well<00:02:50.730> as

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
does work but it doesn't work as well as

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.229 
does work but it doesn't work as well as
they<00:02:51.330> claim<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.170> works<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.650> think<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
they claim that it works I think that it

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.199 
they claim that it works I think that it
helps<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.590> it's<00:02:55.739> probably<00:02:56.069> not<00:02:56.489> worth<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
helps but it's probably not worth the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.970 
helps but it's probably not worth the
amount<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.569> money<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> pay<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
amount of money that you have to pay to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.509 
amount of money that you have to pay to
buy<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
buy it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.490 
buy it
overall<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.209> review<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.690> definitely<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.410> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
overall this review is definitely one of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.930 
overall this review is definitely one of
those<00:03:01.620> annoying<00:03:01.860> reviews<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.430> isn't<00:03:02.670> overly

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
those annoying reviews that isn't overly

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.400 
those annoying reviews that isn't overly
positive<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.480> isn't<00:03:03.600> overly<00:03:03.959> negative

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
positive it isn't overly negative

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.780 
positive it isn't overly negative
I'm<00:03:04.530> definitely<00:03:04.830> sitting<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.459> fence<00:03:05.640> here

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I'm definitely sitting on the fence here

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.030 
I'm definitely sitting on the fence here
so<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:07.019> don't<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.290> how<00:03:07.380> helpful<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.830> will<00:03:07.950> be

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
so I don't know how helpful it will be

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400
