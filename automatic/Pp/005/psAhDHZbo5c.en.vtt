00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all in September came the final 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.620
 version 8 which has already managed to bring 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 much pain to owners of old devices i 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.860
 familiar with this version of operating 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.870
 systems since July was once on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.120
 development stage and in this video I want 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 tell how you are with 8 being conducted on ipad 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 mini first generation and on ipod touch 5 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.779
 and whether it should be updated if you 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.779
 this is not done yet and so we went 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 Let me remind you that the first generation ipad mini 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.399
 ipod touch 5 have the same 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 characteristics mean and they work 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.140
 will be about the same they are installed 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 old enough a5 processor because 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.670
 this video will also be relevant for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 iphone 4s and ipad 2 owners 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 let's start with ipad mini i can't say 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 that everything here is terrible interface and not 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.129
 lag moves between workers 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.199
 desks and closing applications occurs 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 fairly smoothly and even problems with 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.090
 forever losing spotlight search somehow 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.739
 solved but here if you start working with 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
 applications then everything looks a bit 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 otherwise, let's open to everyone 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 youtube and play the video somewhere year 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.619
 back to the client of this site added 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 washed folding video in small 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.630
 the window below if you do this on the ipad 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.180
 mini you can see how to settle 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.189
 it inhibits the collapse animation 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.560
 somehow strangely twitching and so 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509
 happening constantly of course this is not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.229
 critical and you can not pay for it 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.450
 attention also want to note control 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.250
 center who wish 71 we said 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.110
 interesting animations when we have it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 pull it out elastic bounces down 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.979
 all this is accompanied by curves 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.290
 twitches on ipad mini 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.060
 Most likely the a5 processor does not cope 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.770
 such an animation can it just 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 flaw on the part of apple 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 but it looks very strange personally for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 I probably this is due to the fact that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.009
 ipad samcontrol center narrow and long 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 because of what animation lunge looks like 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.329
 some convulsions for the rest of this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.579
 the tablet works pretty well but 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.619
 Of course it happens when setting in games 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.960
 small brakes in attack interfaces in 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.069
 long application launch but with 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 the battery is pretty good 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.590
 the tablet is not particularly 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.140
 You are all good at charging but I want 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.209
 notice that with active use 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.870
 allowed much faster than that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.209
 air 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.090
 I want to note in advance that this ipad 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.590
 recently purchased has few applications 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.280
 because if your device is a year or 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.620
 two she can slow down now let's see 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 on ipod touch 5 it was on it that I sat on 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.610
 of 86 4 beta, by the way, the release itself is not much 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.030
 different from in this version of firmware cs 8 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.940
 beta 4 to s-802 my device is awful 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 slowed down almost everything 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.900
 work speeds are somewhat similar 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 some cheap android smartphone 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.360
 there were always problems with the application 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 camera + 81 is more or less normal 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.130
 really good work smoothness 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.900
 it is felt but at least leafing 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 Multitasking does not look more like 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.580
 slide show control center also 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.290
 twitches like on ipad mini with 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.280
 summer in the notification center is loading 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.410
 pretty long 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.720
 sometimes noticeable brakes when opening 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.489
 applications if you enable the function 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.410
 decrease movement and disable 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.420
 Blur the speed of the device 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.820
 the animation will increase slightly 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.590
 smoother despite being both 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.870
 devices are more or less normal 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.760
 most quickly you system does not feel everything 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.850
 happens somehow smoothly and slowly 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.470
 is it worth updating most likely given in 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.470
 After all, the application will take you to it. 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.230
 soon and having updated the union 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.090
 7 - 8 in especially not lose anything because 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.930
 would you processor speed 5 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.630
 lost yet 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.030
 We turn completely there personally I think 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.430
 that updating my family floor ruined 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.010
 many older devices are more likely even to those 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.750
 that has forbidden rollback but also 6 that on the contrary 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.140
 it was necessary to do for devices that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.819
 not come out union 7 is worth remembering that s8 is 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.380
 latest update for processors 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.140
 again and most likely again 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.269
 x devices on these chips to avoid already 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.950
 will not receive however if not active 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.230
 user of your device and you are not 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.230
 Download the app in tons from the appstore 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.819
 best of all is still 79 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.310
 you will always have time to upgrade 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.530
 I hope you have done it all. 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.639
