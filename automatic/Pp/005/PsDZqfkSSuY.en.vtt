00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.320
 I am jeffrey from www.politiekarchief.nl 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.499
 I'm going to explain to you how you can start playing the guitar 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.329
 I have a right-handed guitar and will therefore explain everything before 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.380
 right-handed people 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.329
 pr left-handed then you need a left-handed guitar 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.800
 and you can request more information from the local music store 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 put a guitar on your right leg 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 make sure you have a nice shot as you can play 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.210
 the right hand is your playing country 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.210
 and that your left hand takes the boxes 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.320
 you need the first guitar to have a voice to sound nice that your guitar can 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.710
 to get 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.960
 you can do that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.310
 with a digital tuner 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.530
 which is very easy 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.530
 but it is also possible with a stamp outing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010
 I will first have some serious voices 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.420
 makes the polling station 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 and only then to vote with the voice 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.410
 even the first vote in a row 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.740
 this asking talk it gives the rotation is false and greens and if it is right 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.160
 and therefore one 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 a number of times indicating whether it is not too high or too low 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.030
 so very easy 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 there is the highest income to the first string 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.530
 I have you here very large and the boat that is too little so I go a higher 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.370
 rate 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.340
 do you want this to make the strings eyes sound and there is a link sun 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 busselaar and the lessons clockwise 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.580
 try we want to try that it comes in the green area the good 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.580
 area and that is not in a good mood 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.099
 this senna voted well 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.059
 I think that's what the organizer has 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.229
 the 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 the 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.689
 also voted and eager for the next step 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.689
 vote this case with the stamp 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.019
 if you think the gradual they sound alike and and little apart 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.719
 differences but after two weeks between the two sounds then you have one 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.359
 well supported with the whistle 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.729
 I can now check whether it has failed to agree with the whistle 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.729
 with digital voting 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.789
 I also have to close the vote 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.849
 they indicate that the couple in a couple is extremely difficult there 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.939
 in digital voting 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.730
 I'd say ado if we didn't practice much with digital voting 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 chat to purchase purchase from local musicians 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.879
 I will inform you to vote no 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.879
 expressed with digital support 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.109
 the riders voted to kiss and kiss successively attacks 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.919
 or with an agreement 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.999
 after agreement of the guitar you can continue to the page learn pepsi 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.009
 read 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.879
 this was the video 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.059
