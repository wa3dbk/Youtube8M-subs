let's go through the list and see which

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.880 
let's go through the list and see which
ones<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.600> firstly<00:00:54.929> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.109> eliminate<00:00:55.499> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
ones we're firstly going to eliminate so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.319 
ones we're firstly going to eliminate so
firstly<00:00:56.190> we're<00:00:56.339> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.519> eliminate<00:00:56.879> Docs<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
firstly we're going to eliminate Docs to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.509 
firstly we're going to eliminate Docs to
stock<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> method<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> madness<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.309> that's

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
stock a method in the madness and that's

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.099 
stock a method in the madness and that's
because<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.909> require<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.480> least<00:01:00.539> two<00:01:00.780> players

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
because you require at least two players

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.450 
because you require at least two players
to<00:01:01.289> play<00:01:01.409> them<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.190> farming

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to play them and when you're farming

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
to play them and when you're farming
you're<00:01:02.850> ideally<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.480> looking<00:01:03.719> for

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you're ideally going to be looking for

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600 
you're ideally going to be looking for
missions<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.620> complete<00:01:04.980> solo<00:01:05.400> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
missions that you can complete solo on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
missions that you can complete solo on
Hard<00:01:05.850> difficulty<00:01:06.180> next<00:01:07.080> we're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
Hard difficulty next we're going to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.930 
Hard difficulty next we're going to
eliminate<00:01:07.500> any<00:01:07.860> missions<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.490> too

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
eliminate any missions that are too

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.730 
eliminate any missions that are too
difficult<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.480> just<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.900> far<00:01:10.140> too<00:01:10.170> long<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
difficult or just take far too long and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.020 
difficult or just take far too long and
that's<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.399> when<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.670> looking<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.970> a

mission to grind you want to make sure
it's<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.770> chief<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.490> easy<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:15.000> complete

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's a chief more easy to complete

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's a chief more easy to complete
mission<00:01:15.630> there<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.290> some<00:01:16.470> missions<00:01:16.710> out

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
mission there are some missions out

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
mission there are some missions out
there<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> fun<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.149> quite<00:01:18.810> a

there there are a lot of fun but quite a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
there there are a lot of fun but quite a
big<00:01:19.049> challenge<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.250> can't

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
big challenge and you just can't

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
big challenge and you just can't
reliably<00:01:20.790> complete<00:01:21.329> them<00:01:21.479> justify<00:01:22.200> keeping

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
reliably complete them justify keeping

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
reliably complete them justify keeping
them<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> list<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.340> firstly<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:23.850> going

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
them in the list so firstly we're going

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100 
them in the list so firstly we're going
to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.149> rid<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> Lester's<00:01:24.689> chemical

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
with a four start location so you will

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.879 
with a four start location so you will
be<00:05:31.470> forced<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.860> start<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.160> martin's<00:05:32.550> house<00:05:32.729> and

the best mission to farm at level 61 or

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.760 
the best mission to farm at level 61 or
over<00:05:38.700> is<00:05:39.110> probably<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.229> a<00:05:40.260> surprise<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.530> most

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770
