you<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> put<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> Baltimore<00:02:00.210> Ravens<00:02:00.240> as

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you have to put the Baltimore Ravens as

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
you have to put the Baltimore Ravens as
a<00:02:00.869> challenge<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> 49ers<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
a challenge for the 49ers I think that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.910 
a challenge for the 49ers I think that
the<00:02:03.659> 49ers<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the 49ers have the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.059 
the 49ers have the
on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> defensive<00:02:06.119> area<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.830> look<00:02:07.979> at

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
on the defensive area and you look at

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
on the defensive area and you look at
the<00:02:08.160> offensive<00:02:08.459> area<00:02:08.880> also<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.420> had<00:02:09.569> that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the offensive area also they had that

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.050 
the offensive area also they had that
advantage<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:11.160> something<00:02:11.459> special

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
advantage but it's something special

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.260 
advantage but it's something special
that's<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.690> Baltimore<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:14.090> kills<00:02:15.090> me

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that's going on in Baltimore it kills me

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.970 
that's going on in Baltimore it kills me
to<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.560> pick<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> San

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
to do this but I have to pick a San

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.580 
to do this but I have to pick a San
Francisco<00:02:17.340> 49ers<00:02:17.849> I<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.870> Ravens

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
Francisco 49ers I think that the Ravens

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.270 
Francisco 49ers I think that the Ravens
all<00:02:19.830> season<00:02:20.340> they've<00:02:20.970> only<00:02:21.180> faced<00:02:22.100> rg3<00:02:23.100> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
all season they've only faced rg3 and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 
all season they've only faced rg3 and
and<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.480> think<00:02:24.720> Kaepernick<00:02:25.020> as<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.350> better

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and I think Kaepernick as a better

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.800 
and I think Kaepernick as a better
version<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.069> rg3<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.910> think<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.569> his<00:02:27.660> arm

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
version of rg3 I think that his arm

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.479 
version of rg3 I think that his arm
stronger<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.410> think<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:28.980> run<00:02:29.069> faster

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
stronger I think that you can run faster

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.000 
stronger I think that you can run faster
than<00:02:29.520> rg3<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.140> he's<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.530> solid

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
than rg3 I just think that he's a solid

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
than rg3 I just think that he's a solid
solid<00:02:32.550> football<00:02:32.940> player<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.959> going<00:02:34.230> into

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
solid football player and and going into

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.080 
solid football player and and going into
this<00:02:34.530> game<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.550> look<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.790> Michael

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
this game you have to look at Michael

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.759 
this game you have to look at Michael
Crabtree<00:02:36.599> who<00:02:36.870> made<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> mistake<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.680> that

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
Crabtree who made a mistake in that

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.830 
Crabtree who made a mistake in that

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
Gore retina ran the ball pretty well and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.330 
Gore retina ran the ball pretty well and
Vernon<00:02:42.600> Davis<00:02:42.720> came<00:02:43.110> alive<00:02:43.350> running<00:02:43.860> Davis<00:02:44.160> in

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
Vernon Davis came alive running Davis in

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.759 
Vernon Davis came alive running Davis in
that<00:02:44.610> second<00:02:45.000> half<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.360> game<00:02:45.660> open<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
that second half of that game open the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.680 
that second half of that game open the
field<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> he<00:02:47.489> really<00:02:47.730> gave<00:02:47.940> Kaepernick<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
field up and he really gave Kaepernick a

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.630 
field up and he really gave Kaepernick a
big<00:02:49.170> target<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.860> field<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.340> can

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
big target down the field and he can

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.479 
big target down the field and he can
cause<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.600> many<00:02:51.720> mismatches<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.620> don't<00:02:53.430> think

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
cause so many mismatches I don't think

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.220 
cause so many mismatches I don't think
that<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> Ravens<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> linebacker<00:02:55.019> that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that the Ravens have a linebacker that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.479 
that the Ravens have a linebacker that
can<00:02:55.350> keep<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:55.650> Vernon<00:02:55.980> Davis<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.400> know

can keep up with Vernon Davis I know

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.640 
can keep up with Vernon Davis I know
that<00:02:56.610> best<00:02:57.000> bet<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:58.290> shadow

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
that best bet is going to be to shadow

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.670 
that best bet is going to be to shadow
that<00:02:59.130> tight<00:02:59.430> end<00:02:59.610> with<00:02:59.880> Ed<00:03:00.209> Reed<00:03:00.780> over<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> top

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
that tight end with Ed Reed over the top

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.559 
that tight end with Ed Reed over the top
and<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.069> have<00:03:02.190> Ray<00:03:02.640> Lewis<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.090> an

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
and you can have Ray Lewis in an

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.600 
and you can have Ray Lewis in an
intermediate<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.799> going<00:03:05.010> into<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.280> super

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
intermediate but going into the super

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.150 
intermediate but going into the super
bowl<00:03:05.790> game<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> 49ers<00:03:07.230> chances<00:03:07.980> I'm

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
bowl game I like the 49ers chances I'm

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.319 
bowl game I like the 49ers chances I'm
not<00:03:08.370> saying<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> blood<00:03:09.299> I

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
not saying it's going to be a blood I

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.060 
not saying it's going to be a blood I
think<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.870> game<00:03:10.049> will<00:03:10.109> be<00:03:10.260> nine<00:03:10.530> points<00:03:10.980> or

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
think this game will be nine points or

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.210 
think this game will be nine points or
less<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.940> spread<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.829> think<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.160> game

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
less the spread I think that this game

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.800 
less the spread I think that this game
is<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.609> be<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.730> very<00:03:14.910> close<00:03:15.180> game<00:03:15.209> because

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
is going to be a very close game because
