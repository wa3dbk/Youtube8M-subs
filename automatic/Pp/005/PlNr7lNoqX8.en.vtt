traveling<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.439> device<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.119> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
traveling with this device so this is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.620 
traveling with this device so this is
the<00:01:12.780> included<00:01:13.409> carrying<00:01:13.560> case<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:15.299> is

the included carrying case it is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.060 
the included carrying case it is
actually<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.140> too<00:01:16.200> snug<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
actually a little too snug to get the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.010 
actually a little too snug to get the
drive<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.430> easily<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> guess<00:01:18.840> that's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
drive in easily but I guess that's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.270 
drive in easily but I guess that's
better<00:01:19.170> than<00:01:19.259> having<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.740> too<00:01:19.890> loose<00:01:20.070> or

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
better than having it be too loose or

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.510 
better than having it be too loose or
having<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.549> fall<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:21.030> over<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> place

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
having it fall out all over the place

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.330 
having it fall out all over the place
and<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:24.200> as<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.350> mentioned<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.890> short

about 4200 files so that's a twelve

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.950 
about 4200 files so that's a twelve
point<00:01:47.250> seven<00:01:47.399> three<00:01:47.700> gigabytes<00:01:47.970> batch<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
point seven three gigabytes batch of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
point seven three gigabytes batch of
files<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.470> took<00:01:49.649> seven<00:01:50.040> minutes<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.369> 37

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
files and that took seven minutes and 37

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
files and that took seven minutes and 37
seconds<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.689> translates<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
seconds and that translates out to a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
seconds and that translates out to a
real-world<00:01:52.649> transfer<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> say<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
real-world transfer with like I say a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.880 
real-world transfer with like I say a
mixed<00:01:54.659> batch<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> files<00:01:55.170> its<00:01:55.409> documents

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
mixed batch of files its documents

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910 
mixed batch of files its documents
videos<00:01:56.219> music<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:57.420> kinds<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.840> stuff<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
videos music all kinds of stuff so that

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
videos music all kinds of stuff so that
works<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> real<00:01:59.820> world<00:02:00.000> transfer<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
works out to a real world transfer of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
works out to a real world transfer of
about<00:02:00.840> twenty-eight<00:02:01.259> point<00:02:01.469> five<00:02:01.560> two

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
about twenty-eight point five two

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
about twenty-eight point five two
megabytes<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> second<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.909> pretty<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.509> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
megabytes a second so pretty good it is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.770 
megabytes a second so pretty good it is
a<00:02:03.810> USB<00:02:04.250> 2.0<00:02:05.250> hard<00:02:05.549> drive<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.719> see

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a USB 2.0 hard drive and as you can see

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.089 
a USB 2.0 hard drive and as you can see
it's<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> size<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> deck<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> cards

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it's about the size of a deck of cards

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
it's about the size of a deck of cards
they've<00:02:09.000> also<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> quite<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> bit<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
they've also put a quite a bit of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
they've also put a quite a bit of
attention<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.700> looks<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
attention on how the thing looks so you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
attention on how the thing looks so you
see<00:02:12.330> around<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> outside<00:02:12.959> there's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> pink

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
see around the outside there's a pink

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
see around the outside there's a pink
basil<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.580> would<00:02:14.790> obviously<00:02:15.120> vary<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
basil this would obviously vary with the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.170 
basil this would obviously vary with the
color<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.380> Drive<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:17.040> I'm<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.730> sure

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
color of Drive that you get I'm not sure

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.310 
color of Drive that you get I'm not sure
if<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.330> were<00:02:18.450> able<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.600> see<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.900> camera<00:02:19.080> but

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
if you were able to see it on camera but

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.540 
if you were able to see it on camera but
there's<00:02:19.470> actually<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.740> lattice<00:02:20.100> pattern<00:02:20.280> in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
there's actually a lattice pattern in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.850 
there's actually a lattice pattern in
here<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.480> case<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.960> hearts<00:02:22.320> on

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
here and in this case it's hearts on

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.270 
see a blue status light in the top here
it<00:02:47.400> extends<00:02:48.180> about<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.660> far<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.560> bar<00:02:49.770> LED

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it extends about this far it's a bar LED

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.940

so<00:02:50.760> that'll<00:02:51.000> tell<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.870> drives<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
so that'll tell you if the drives on and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.110 
so that'll tell you if the drives on and
receiving<00:02:53.310> power<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.000> you're

transferring<00:02:54.390> files<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.900> will<00:02:55.020> actually

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
transferring files that will actually

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.490 
transferring files that will actually
flash<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.830> signify<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.730> working<00:02:57.500> now

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500

it's<00:02:58.650> Mac<00:02:58.830> or<00:02:59.070> PC<00:02:59.100> compatible<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:01.020> really

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
it's Mac or PC compatible but really

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.740 
it's Mac or PC compatible but really
this<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.430> one's<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.270> PC<00:03:03.600> owners

like I said between 85 and a hundred

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.400 
like I said between 85 and a hundred
bucks<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.060> pretty<00:03:09.330> reasonable<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.900> 250
