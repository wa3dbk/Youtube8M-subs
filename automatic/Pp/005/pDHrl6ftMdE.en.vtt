 we find with a two can read about 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.750
 the future 1.8 the future version of 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.430
 minecraft and good first of all to give 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.900
 thanks to a subscriber who was the 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.910
 who gave me the news because I did not 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.380
 had given account the subscriber is called 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.660
 sergio more many thanks to him for 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.670
 pass me this poster and good the spoiler 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.610
 a minecraft developer brings it 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.670
 Ryan jules that by the way I do not know and I 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.789
 but it reminds me of steve aoki 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.350
 exclaimed or is my thing I do not know 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.239
 and good the tweet that he put on his twitter 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.879
 is this already basically that is 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.190
 working a prototype that carries three 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.839
 weeks in it and that totally is not 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.120
 official at the moment but who does it for 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.530
 fun and that pretty well can with 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.739
 future simply from minecraft who 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.629
 he knows even 1.8 or later but the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.339
 idea is pretty good and good some 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.469
 once we enter that link in gurb we 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.719
 we find with these photos these the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.329
 first of all as you see is a new 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.010
 kind of world world that used and those 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.960
 you can modify there is a key that is 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.330
 customs and there you can modify the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.940
 world and what to modify then modify 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.180
 many patterns the water level 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.410
 of mountain the level of forest everything 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.390
 who is watching on screen as it is a 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.370
 gone on a lot of things for 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.790
 modify and even if you want strong 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.610
 joel if you want rabbids then the temples 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.190
 all that you can modify and of course 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.020
 allows you to create a world enough to your 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.630
 everyone is modifiable that is a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 own world of yours and apart also a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.650
 random ice the random key and I know how 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.870
 you want to pronounce let's go english 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.280
 it's not Mary Welsh as I always say and with 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.840
 that key what we're going to do is that 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.640
 all adjustments are made in a way 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 random look like a random world 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 but with our adjustments that 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.120
 they modify all we go and that we will obtain 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.860
 once we modify these options the 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.410
 world customized as such models 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.330
 like this one like those worlds sky sides in 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.370
 this case we can also find us 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.690
 some amazing caves like these 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.390
 these things remind me a lot of the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.910
 ultra-hostile maps on many maps that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 They are ultra hardcore and hostile and usually 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.360
 be so very dark caves put me 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.250
 remember a lot to it we can 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.810
 meet old people like this one 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.080
 it really reminds me a lot of the videos 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.970
 more amplified but more reduced already 6 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.750
 we send it amplified is a kind of 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.190
 world too 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.050
 but that consumes a lot of fish 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.760
 ce need a blow but instead 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.990
 this is like an amplified wind but 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.030
 reduced for anyone 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.220
 I can play it and it's pretty good 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.380
 idea or we also have this as it is a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.570
 island in the middle of nowhere pretty cool 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.060
 It must be said or also this one 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.300
 came the mix of true 10 of all 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.350
 floating island skyline and that tell me 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.120
 I like a lot 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.950
 I liked it but as I say the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.840
 official has said the developer 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.970
 in question since official does it by 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.770
 fun and it takes three it seems that I 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.350
 is it working hard that I will see if 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.459
 then he takes it as an idea for the game 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.950
 officially 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.209
 I hope it's cool enough and good 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.010
 more kids like the theme that you think 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.410
 it really is a pass especially I 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.610
 liked the one in the cave was impressed 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.560
 that's why it reminds me so much more 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.270
 ultra hostile maps and that's going to be 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 make it easy for many people to make maps of 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.570
 adventure because you already have the cave and 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.060
 then put chests or whatever you want and 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.560
 modify a bit and good once said 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.300
 this guys if you liked the video 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.459

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.800

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.750
