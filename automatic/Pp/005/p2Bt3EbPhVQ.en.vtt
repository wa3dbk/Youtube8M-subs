00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.530
 Hello here for you is the Moritz of mine Jusic and I have 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.900
 Something brought along namely a women card combination from internally has Ezio 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.270
 Express card and the whole then with a breakout boxes is from the company 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.370
 Easy is called Macs Iro and that really refers to maximum in &amp; out shortly 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.530
 because the part is waiting for something with a whole series of interfaces 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.940
 so seldom seen in the form possible in numbers and 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 henceforth course internal Kate then direct link to the Breg Outbox the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.410
 means to have super good latency of course you have on the front 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.540
 first of all two classic analog inputs that could of course for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.920
 Microphones use signals for laymen and you can see that I have switches as well 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.750
 on high up is so free they led the drivers Parson cetera 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.660
 and that means you can of course also directly by 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.190
 Record music in a simple way directly over the baker box 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.860
 The app of course also has a headphone preamp in it on the front 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.650
 And what you also massively that is the card that you expect come in here 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.830
 is the binding of the Easy which is at your disposal 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.560
 to yes the bakers box is a simple cable, all channels were run over it 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.799
 and those on the side 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.560
 he looks like a celebration Uelzen place in the snack, actually, but a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.159
 of course with my protocol 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.219
 where you then of the company Easy, of course, other converters and 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.149
 DranhÃ¤ngen preliminary stages can then around the Maxx Aero new calculator 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.090
 to retrieve all the signals 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.240
 so the back is actually much more interesting at the device Street it 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.630
 just around 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.520
 can see the stolen goods because order here CET already okay okay I have 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.960
 really a whole lot 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.080
 At connections available as I said here connection to your internal this 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.400
 Express card and then what fits here 4 celebration of your interfaces 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.460
 and therefore expects 8 pieces I have just there 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.600
 Tops teacher and on that is Thun 30 Heinz Frohn 30 off 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.009
 and the whole as I said about fiber optic cable which could be so 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.900
 really many external digital converters connect 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.230
 and Jeff Bader, of course, percent conversions year if you're already on the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.779
 Digital level is for then simply passed on the new computer 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.709
 Of course we also have here 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.829
 spd expert as clear even more digital interface and what would be nice 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.990
 to synchronize 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.290
 It does not matter if the interface is here via the BNC connections 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 could it all then facts from somewhere else if you really ne good 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.710
 block off or you can also use the good form of them for others 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.029
 Areas to bars 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:28.989
 and of course 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.620
 "We still have to perform, we have analog outputs as well 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.560
 Psychic served as well as XLR so that your April shoot 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.809
 So the leak is OK 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.999
 As the name implies, an interface is really a JAL together 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:44.899
 leader 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:49.450
 for many hikers for Philipp Reemtsma dena have digital option in it 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 and with that you can really use the whole thing as a central for your studio 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.540
 and many prayers a year, and all of them converge here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.100
 to let 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.339
 and the whole team was a nice simple priest ExpressCard 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.949
 Of course the driver is silky too 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.959
 compatible with Windows and with Mac so that it is independent of the platform 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.039
 that synonymous with everyone the Aves software can use yes 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.389
 the Wars also already far e7 knife Jod 32 before we the 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.379
 want complete drawing times and if you want some of you from 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.659
 the size of the card from the connections yes with the FES again 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.959
 you want to convince yourself then come over here while you can mine 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.889
 Of course, as always, try it at home thanks to our service package 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.110
 with the 33 days to the backbone the 66 days exchange 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.450
 and in that sense, and at first mourning
