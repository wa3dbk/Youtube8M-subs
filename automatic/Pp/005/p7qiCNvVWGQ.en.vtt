00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
so we're here with David the ISO

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.620 
so we're here with David the ISO
acoustics<00:00:20.470> booth<00:00:20.679> is<00:00:20.949> Mamluk<00:00:21.460> it's<00:00:21.580> noisy<00:00:22.000> but

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
acoustics booth is Mamluk it's noisy but

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.390 
acoustics booth is Mamluk it's noisy but
here<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.199> some<00:00:23.380> lovely<00:00:23.589> new<00:00:23.710> speaker<00:00:24.160> stands

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
here is some lovely new speaker stands

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.880 
here is some lovely new speaker stands
which<00:00:25.089> look<00:00:26.050> rather<00:00:26.230> different<00:00:26.410> from<00:00:26.769> the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
which look rather different from the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.069 
which look rather different from the
ones<00:00:27.039> that<00:00:27.160> we've<00:00:27.400> seen<00:00:27.789> before<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.689> these

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
ones that we've seen before and these

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.200 
ones that we've seen before and these
are<00:00:29.230> solid<00:00:29.380> metal<00:00:29.769> yes<00:00:30.249> can<00:00:30.669> you<00:00:30.699> tell<00:00:30.820> us<00:00:30.999> what

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
are solid metal yes can you tell us what

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.880 
are solid metal yes can you tell us what
the<00:00:31.269> story<00:00:31.509> is<00:00:31.599> behind<00:00:31.839> them<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.380> how<00:00:32.710> they

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
the story is behind them and how they

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.709 
the story is behind them and how they
differ<00:00:33.190> from<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.670> from<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.239> regular<00:00:34.539> ones

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
differ from the from the regular ones

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.900 
differ from the from the regular ones
yeah<00:00:35.230> basically<00:00:35.739> what<00:00:36.190> we've<00:00:36.340> done<00:00:36.520> is<00:00:36.699> we're

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
yeah basically what we've done is we're

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.250 
yeah basically what we've done is we're
going<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.149> little<00:00:37.180> bit<00:00:37.449> upscale<00:00:37.899> with<00:00:37.930> these

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
going a little bit upscale with these

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
going a little bit upscale with these
these<00:00:38.530> are<00:00:38.710> solid<00:00:39.129> aluminium<00:00:39.670> aluminium<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
these are solid aluminium aluminium and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.729 
these are solid aluminium aluminium and
we've<00:00:42.820> done<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.239> same<00:00:43.480> with<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.899> Isolators

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
we've done the same with the Isolators

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.840 
we've done the same with the Isolators
so<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.039> principles<00:00:45.550> are<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:45.730> same

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
so the principles are the same

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.939 
so the principles are the same
everything's<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.719> same<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.710> we've<00:00:47.920> just

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
everything's the same and we've just

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.160 
everything's the same and we've just
made<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:48.940> it's<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.269> nicer<00:00:49.870> cleaner

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
made it so that it's a nicer cleaner

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.400 
made it so that it's a nicer cleaner
package<00:00:51.359> as<00:00:52.359> you<00:00:52.420> know<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.989> weight<00:00:53.199> is<00:00:53.379> a

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
package as you know the weight is a

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.319 
package as you know the weight is a
problem<00:00:53.859> for<00:00:54.070> us<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.460> table<00:00:54.699> we<00:00:54.910> don't<00:00:55.090> want

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
problem for us the table we don't want

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.270 
problem for us the table we don't want
any<00:00:55.510> mass<00:00:55.750> because<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.469> want<00:00:56.679> it<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.859> be<00:00:56.980> live

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
any mass because we want it to be live

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.150 
any mass because we want it to be live
and<00:00:57.519> react<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.600> monitor<00:00:59.019> itself<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.949> we've

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
and react to the monitor itself so we've

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.829 
and react to the monitor itself so we've
trimmed<00:01:00.429> it<00:01:00.579> down<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.000> we've<00:01:01.120> made<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.480> we've

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
trimmed it down and we've made it we've

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.660 
trimmed it down and we've made it we've
tuned<00:01:02.109> it<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:02.620> we're<00:01:02.739> getting<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.429> same

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
tuned it so that we're getting the same

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.189 
tuned it so that we're getting the same
performance<00:01:04.030> or<00:01:04.360> better<00:01:04.570> than<00:01:04.780> what<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.050> got

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
performance or better than what we got

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.280 
performance or better than what we got
from<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.500> 155<00:01:06.190> okay<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.630> are<00:01:07.810> these<00:01:07.930> going<00:01:08.200> to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
from the 155 okay so are these going to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.780 
from the 155 okay so are these going to
replace<00:01:08.620> over<00:01:08.890> your<00:01:09.040> models<00:01:09.340> or<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.640> this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
replace over your models or is this

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.580 
replace over your models or is this
going<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.090> be<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.240> more<00:01:10.420> expensive<00:01:10.900> model<00:01:11.230> on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
going to be a more expensive model on

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.550 
going to be a more expensive model on
the<00:01:11.950> side<00:01:12.130> yeah<00:01:12.580> just<00:01:12.940> enough<00:01:13.210> an<00:01:13.900> upscale

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the side yeah just enough an upscale

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.930 
the side yeah just enough an upscale
version<00:01:14.800> of<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.670> 155<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.760> have<00:01:18.910> a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
version of the 155 and see you have a

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.400 
version of the 155 and see you have a
piece<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.240> hardware<00:01:19.630> there<00:01:20.110> this<00:01:20.230> is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
piece of hardware there this is

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.600 
piece of hardware there this is
something<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.800> do<00:01:20.920> with<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.130> adjustment

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
something to do with the adjustment

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550 
something to do with the adjustment
making<00:01:21.910> that's<00:01:22.120> correct<00:01:22.390> in<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.140> existing

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
making that's correct in the existing

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.870 
making that's correct in the existing
product<00:01:24.010> we<00:01:24.160> put<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.490> little<00:01:24.640> plastic

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
product we put the little plastic

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.960 
product we put the little plastic
inserts<00:01:25.870> inside<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.620> get<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.830> tilt<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:27.790> this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
inserts inside to get the tilt and this

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.730 
inserts inside to get the tilt and this
one<00:01:28.210> here<00:01:28.390> it's<00:01:28.510> actually<00:01:28.660> threaded<00:01:29.350> it

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
one here it's actually threaded it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.710 
one here it's actually threaded it
actually<00:01:30.160> has<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.460> gradations<00:01:31.000> inside<00:01:31.480> by

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
actually has the gradations inside by

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.930 
actually has the gradations inside by
degrees<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.860> then<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.160> turns<00:01:33.370> red<00:01:33.700> when

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
degrees and then it turns red when

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.850 
degrees and then it turns red when
you've<00:01:34.120> overextended<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.410> just<00:01:35.530> a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
you've overextended it so it's just a

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.890 
you've overextended it so it's just a
nice<00:01:35.980> cleaner<00:01:36.700> way<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.030> doing<00:01:37.210> that<00:01:37.630> tilt

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
nice cleaner way of doing that tilt

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.100 
nice cleaner way of doing that tilt
adjustment<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.210> recap<00:01:40.540> these<00:01:40.780> work

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
adjustment just to recap these work

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
adjustment just to recap these work
particularly<00:01:41.560> well

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
particularly well

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.340 
particularly well
desks<00:01:43.829> type<00:01:44.070> setup<00:01:44.310> Stanley<00:01:45.000> yes

traditionally<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.469> get<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> lot<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.060> vibration

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
traditionally you get a lot of vibration

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.310 
traditionally you get a lot of vibration
from<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> speaker<00:01:48.539> going<00:01:48.810> into<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> desk

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
from the speaker going into the desk

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.249 
from the speaker going into the desk
surface<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.280> great<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.259> useful

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
surface that's great and this useful

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
surface that's great and this useful
degree<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> isolation<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.850> quite<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
degree of isolation so it's quite a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.370 
degree of isolation so it's quite a
different<00:01:54.179> approach<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> ones<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
different approach from the ones that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
different approach from the ones that
mess<00:01:55.799> that's<00:01:56.640> correct

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
mess that's correct

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.660 
mess that's correct
our<00:01:57.630> idea<00:01:58.110> our<00:01:58.229> concept<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.429> upper

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
our idea our concept is that the upper

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
our idea our concept is that the upper
frame<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.090> live<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> monitor<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
frame is live with with the monitor and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
frame is live with with the monitor and
we<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:03.000> manage<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> moves<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.619> we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
we actually manage how it moves so we

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620 
we actually manage how it moves so we
keep<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.039> on<00:02:05.159> access<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.329> where<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
keep it on access and that's where the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
keep it on access and that's where the
clarity<00:02:06.960> comes<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.319> because<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.770> doesn't<00:02:08.130> move

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
clarity comes up because it doesn't move

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.789 
clarity comes up because it doesn't move
around<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.299> bobble<00:02:09.599> head<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:10.019> we<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.590> want

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
around and bobble head around we we want

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.520 
around and bobble head around we we want
it<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> track<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.000> by<00:02:12.180> by<00:02:12.900> managing<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
it to track and then by by managing the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
it to track and then by by managing the
shape<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.069> thickness<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> durometer<00:02:15.180> we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
shape the thickness in the durometer we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.630 
shape the thickness in the durometer we
manage<00:02:16.170> how<00:02:16.319> quickly<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.830> responds<00:02:17.459> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
manage how quickly it responds and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.150 
manage how quickly it responds and
that's<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.420> tune<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:20.040> get

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that's what we tune to get the to get

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.520 
that's what we tune to get the to get
the<00:02:20.280> result<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> acoustic<00:02:21.209> results<00:02:21.630> yeah<00:02:22.200> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the result the acoustic results yeah so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.410 
the result the acoustic results yeah so
minimal<00:02:23.160> energy<00:02:23.280> ends<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:23.819> getting<00:02:23.940> into<00:02:24.269> your

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
minimal energy ends up getting into your

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.449 
minimal energy ends up getting into your
disco<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:25.079> correct<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.799> even<00:02:26.069> more<00:02:26.280> than

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
disco that's correct but even more than

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.670 
disco that's correct but even more than
another<00:02:26.910> important<00:02:27.450> point<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.110> even<00:02:28.530> if

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
another important point is that even if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.370 
another important point is that even if
we<00:02:28.739> were<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.099> granite<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.819> solid<00:02:30.329> surface<00:02:30.569> we're

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
we were on granite a solid surface we're

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020 
we were on granite a solid surface we're
allowing<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.860> monitor<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.489> breathe<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
allowing that monitor or breathe and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
allowing that monitor or breathe and
we're<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.269> dissipating<00:02:33.959> those<00:02:34.110> secondary

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
we're just dissipating those secondary

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.920 
we're just dissipating those secondary
reflections<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.209> base<00:02:36.450> smear<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
reflections and it's a base smear and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.870 
reflections and it's a base smear and
everything<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.470> disappears<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.549> probably

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
everything that disappears is probably

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.789 
everything that disappears is probably
the<00:02:39.060> first<00:02:39.239> thing<00:02:39.480> you'll<00:02:39.690> notice<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
the first thing you'll notice with the

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.699 
the first thing you'll notice with the
stands<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> one<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.590> shipping<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
stands so one of these shipping and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.340 
stands so one of these shipping and
these<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.489> list<00:02:47.700> will<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.870> US<00:02:49.109> will<00:02:49.319> be

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
these the list will be in the US will be

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.530 
these the list will be in the US will be
240<00:02:50.100> they'll<00:02:50.340> probably<00:02:50.549> sell<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> street

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
240 they'll probably sell on the street

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.039 
240 they'll probably sell on the street
around<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> $200<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.769> pair<00:02:53.190> range<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.049> they'll

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
around the $200 a pair range and they'll

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.690 
around the $200 a pair range and they'll
be<00:02:55.230> available<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.980> probably<00:02:56.310> about<00:02:56.430> six

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
be available and probably about six

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.240 
be available and probably about six
weeks<00:02:56.760> time<00:02:57.290> we're<00:02:58.290> using<00:02:58.650> them<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.069> different

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
weeks time we're using them in different

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.099 
weeks time we're using them in different
sizes<00:02:59.790> for<00:02:59.910> different<00:02:59.970> bonuses<00:03:00.510> we're

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
sizes for different bonuses we're

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.900 
sizes for different bonuses we're
following<00:03:01.380> up<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.069> other<00:03:02.220> sizes<00:03:02.760> we're

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
following up with the other sizes we're

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.910 
following up with the other sizes we're
following<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.750> examples<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.739> did

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
following the same examples that we did

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.740 
following the same examples that we did
with<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.340> other<00:03:05.459> series<00:03:05.940> okay<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.540> you're

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
with the other series okay so you're

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.030 
with the other series okay so you're
kicking<00:03:06.900> off<00:03:07.109> with<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.350> small<00:03:07.620> ones<00:03:07.799> most

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
kicking off with the small ones most

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
kicking off with the small ones most
that's<00:03:08.430> correct<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.420> medium<00:03:09.780> size

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
that's correct this is a medium size

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.449 
that's correct this is a medium size
monitor<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.650> probably<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.040> most<00:03:11.160> popular

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
monitor it's probably the most popular

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.580 
monitor it's probably the most popular
area<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.569> then<00:03:12.750> we'll<00:03:12.900> move<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
area and then we'll move up to the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.069 
area and then we'll move up to the
larger<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.549> we<00:03:15.090> also<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.690> kits<00:03:15.900> to

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
larger one and we also have the kits to

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.199 
larger one and we also have the kits to
integrate<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.799> into<00:03:17.190> floor<00:03:17.430> stands<00:03:17.819> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
integrate it to into floor stands and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.120 
integrate it to into floor stands and
and<00:03:18.420> other<00:03:18.959> products<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:19.769> do<00:03:19.889> with<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
and other products like we do with the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.949 
and other products like we do with the
other<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.940> our<00:03:21.120> other<00:03:21.329> stands<00:03:21.630> too

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
other with our other stands too

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.720 
other with our other stands too
excellent<00:03:22.799> thanks<00:03:23.010> very<00:03:23.160> much<00:03:23.280> today<00:03:23.489> thank
