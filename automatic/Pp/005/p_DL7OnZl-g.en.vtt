00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.100 

this<00:04:03.260> one<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:04.690> by<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.750> taste<00:04:06.080> is<00:04:06.350> very<00:04:06.560> strong

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
this funny for personally I think is

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.890 
this funny for personally I think is
more<00:04:27.590> stronger<00:04:28.070> actually<00:04:28.600> because<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.750> is

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
more stronger actually because this is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.700 
more stronger actually because this is
kind<00:04:30.230> of<00:04:30.550> desert<00:04:31.550> area<00:04:31.970> or<00:04:32.330> hot<00:04:32.630> places<00:04:34.300> but

know about if you go for detail of honey

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.260 
know about if you go for detail of honey
then<00:04:56.480> you<00:04:56.720> can<00:04:56.930> know<00:04:57.110> what<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.830> sitter<00:04:58.070> s<00:04:58.370> I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
then you can know what is the sitter s I

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.460 
then you can know what is the sitter s I
D<00:04:59.950> our<00:05:01.000> sitter<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.450> real<00:05:02.630> spelling<00:05:03.169> if<00:05:03.350> you

that's<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.760> scientist<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.360> research<00:05:14.660> is

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
that's the scientist the research is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.920 
that's the scientist the research is
only<00:05:15.169> two<00:05:15.350> honey<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.310> Minooka<00:05:16.760> consider<00:05:17.330> they

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
only two honey so Minooka consider they
