00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
like miles miles more subscribers than I
do<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.680> how<00:00:49.920> their

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
do so I don't know really how their

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
do so I don't know really how their
selection<00:00:50.460> process<00:00:50.879> works<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.600> if

selection process works I don't know if

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
selection process works I don't know if
it's<00:00:51.899> maybe<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.550> fill

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it's maybe because of some how we fill

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.580
