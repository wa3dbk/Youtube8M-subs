 enamelled for camp or 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.399
 indestructible 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.450
 this is the miele 20 system and this is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.580
 the best system of liquid 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.710
 detergent and this is that public system 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.270
 of wheels that last four years 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.370
 worked and miele has the best 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.470
 detergent developed because it is supplied 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.600
 in plane us that you are under your washing machine 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.760
 and the great advantage of this is 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.950
 that you were ten percent better 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.380
 results and also the big advantage 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.270
 is that you always have the perfect dosage 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.250
 so you never use too much 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.710
 never a little better for your washing machine 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.870
 better for your clothes and good for the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.800
 wallet and these detergents could be 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.660
 of course just our again too 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.370
 available but if you were down from it 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.750
 the reason you want your own detergent 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.790
 use it is also possible because there is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.200
 then also supplied with two empty place us 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 in ourselves can want it 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.980
 fabric softener colors detergent 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.980
 does n't matter because you want 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.980
 and inside would be body 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.720
 And this is a new technique that only 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 Miele has been working on it for a long time 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.840
 but there he is the normal one 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.330
 washing machines have only one 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.430
 pump but means that has against two 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.410
 breakfast normal washing machine with that one 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.480
 pump and goes very carefully 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.540
 the water in it but we want them to 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.250
 two poops they spray it from above 3 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.020
 and thereby you become well and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.850
 the biggest advantage of this is that he 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:36.240
 a full drum within an hour 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.220
 soiled laundry has 95 m2 time 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.860
 wash you of course with regular 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.810
 washing programs and the remaining 5% 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.340
 dissolve with the poppy in front of the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.650
 special washing programs 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.320
 think of pillows and cuddly toys 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.290
 or impregnating your ski clothing and 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.120
 the project goes as follows the capsule 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.070
 bring a wash and that place here 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.960
 at the top and then tell the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.400
 machine here I do have have boxes 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.500
 chosen and he does dressed 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.340
 and of course these capsules are again 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.340
 available from us 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.329
 it uses the term oh 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.760
 softcare drum 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.769
 he already sees a honeycomb structure here 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.989
 that goes between you all for your 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.970
 dress wear as little as possible and other 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.680
 the advantage of the softcare drum is that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.780
 last part of water is evaporated 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.460
 so you get less out of you 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.699
 laundry is coming and therefore easier to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.699
 ironing 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.539
 this washing machine has steamcare that is 

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.189
 means that it is after the wash cycle 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.599
 when the steam program is used 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.409
 so there is easier for it 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.999
 ironing 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.339
 use it now and the program 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:45.179
 so you can hang directly in the closet and 

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.179
 therefore also wear directly 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.360
 it belongs trial system consists of 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.550
 two things so all sensors in the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.770
 machine that he shuts down when there 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.810
 water detection is but this machine is hot 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.180
 therefore also save a water protection 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.100
 the well-known aqua stop 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.300
 in other words, they never run with this machine 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.980
 who see crazy movies 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.180
 the water runs down your stairs we praise 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.180
 fully secured 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.910
 miele uses the prophet o 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.289
 engine 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.360
 so they don't use it 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.310
 carbon brushes and its benefits 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.560
 he said is quieter 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.990
 it is more economical and lasts longer 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.449
 and of course this engine is too 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.449
 made by miele self-measuring germany 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.569

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.490
 1-button control on the left 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.139

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.330
 but to indicate what good you were

 on the right the more specialized programs 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.570

 You can determine the programming yourself 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.919
 when the washing machine 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.479
