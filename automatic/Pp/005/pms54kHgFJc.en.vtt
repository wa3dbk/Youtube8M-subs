00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
computer spreadsheet so refer to your

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.170 
computer spreadsheet so refer to your
handbook<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.540> page<00:00:03.810> 109<00:00:04.490> so<00:00:05.490> in<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.910> spreadsheet

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
handbook on page 109 so in a spreadsheet

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.210 
handbook on page 109 so in a spreadsheet
the<00:00:06.359> formula<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.319> formula<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.859> here<00:00:07.919> is

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the formula this formula right here is

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.499 
the formula this formula right here is
entered<00:00:08.610> into<00:00:08.849> cell<00:00:09.510> c3<00:00:10.670> this<00:00:11.670> contents<00:00:12.420> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
entered into cell c3 this contents of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.900 
entered into cell c3 this contents of
cell<00:00:12.690> c3<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.380> copied<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:13.980> pasted<00:00:14.340> into<00:00:14.519> cell

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
cell c3 are copied and pasted into cell

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.210 
cell c3 are copied and pasted into cell
d5<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> what's<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.609> formula<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.420> cell<00:00:19.050> d5<00:00:19.980> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
d5 so what's the formula in cell d5 so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.620 
d5 so what's the formula in cell d5 so
you're<00:00:20.340> gonna<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.330> like

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
you're gonna have to think of it as like

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.349 
you're gonna have to think of it as like
you<00:00:21.840> had<00:00:22.050> excel<00:00:22.500> sheet<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:23.240> we're<00:00:24.240> gonna

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
you had excel sheet now we're gonna

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
you had excel sheet now we're gonna
learn<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.580> then<00:00:26.580> I'm<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.000> do

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
learn to do it and then I'm gonna do

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.730 
learn to do it and then I'm gonna do
another<00:00:27.390> example<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
another example where we don't have to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.169 
another example where we don't have to
actually<00:00:29.039> work<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.000> have

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
actually work it because you don't have

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
actually work it because you don't have
that<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.480> time<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that much time but then you will have to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.020 
that much time but then you will have to
guess<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.809> essentially<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.980> when<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
guess so essentially here when you have

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
guess so essentially here when you have
the<00:00:36.149> dollar<00:00:36.360> signs<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.320> front<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the dollar signs here in front of the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.540 
the dollar signs here in front of the
row<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> these<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.410> your<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.980> letters<00:00:41.370> or

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
row so these are your your letters or

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.119 
row so these are your your letters or
your<00:00:41.820> columns<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:42.920> numbers<00:00:43.920> are

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
your columns and then your numbers are

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.119 
your columns and then your numbers are
your<00:00:44.430> rows<00:00:44.989> okay<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.920> dollar

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
your rows okay so if you have dollar

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
your rows okay so if you have dollar
signs<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.610> front<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> both

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
signs in front of both

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
signs in front of both
it's<00:00:49.350> called<00:00:49.739> absolute<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.730> change

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it's called absolute it doesn't change

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.459 
it's called absolute it doesn't change
you<00:00:51.360> remain<00:00:51.690> unchanged<00:00:53.539> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you remain unchanged if you have it just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.790 
you remain unchanged if you have it just
in<00:00:55.620> front<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> row<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:57.030> called<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.530> front

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
in front of the row it's called in front

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.279 
in front of the row it's called in front
of<00:00:58.980> either<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.640> actually<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> them

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
of either one actually just one of them

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.579 
of either one actually just one of them
it's<00:01:01.859> called<00:01:02.100> relative<00:01:03.379> designator<00:01:04.379> or

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it's called relative designator or

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.299 
it's called relative designator or
whatever<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.979> call<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
whatever they call it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.289 
whatever they call it
so<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.909> particular<00:01:07.189> whatever<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so that particular whatever it it's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.890 
so that particular whatever it it's
designating<00:01:10.200> remains<00:01:11.070> unchanged<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.390> you'll

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
designating remains unchanged so you'll

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
designating remains unchanged so you'll
see<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:13.530> by<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.490> let's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
see what I mean by that so now let's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.260 
see what I mean by that so now let's
just<00:01:14.850> draw<00:01:15.270> them<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.770> oh<00:01:17.270> let's

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just draw them out so we have oh let's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.380 
just draw them out so we have oh let's
use<00:01:18.479> white<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:21.830> for<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> column<00:01:23.390> B

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
use white so we have a for the column B

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
use white so we have a for the column B
C<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.560> D<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.909> any<00:01:27.090> ezel<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.409> now

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
C and D we don't have any ezel and now

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.399 
C and D we don't have any ezel and now
for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> rows<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.590> three

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
for the rows we have one two three

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.160 
for the rows we have one two three
possibly<00:01:34.409> four<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.920> five<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.610> yeah<00:01:36.170> we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
possibly four or five actually yeah we

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
possibly four or five actually yeah we
have<00:01:37.290> four<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> five<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.220> let's<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.610> draw<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
have four and five so let's just draw it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:52.530 
have four and five so let's just draw it
out<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> have

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:14.190 

ha

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.130 

okay<00:02:15.240> oops<00:02:16.770> okay<00:02:17.770> let<00:02:17.980> me

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.280 

all<00:02:22.950> right<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.390> formula<00:02:27.990> right<00:02:28.020> here

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
all right so so this formula right here

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.370 
all right so so this formula right here
in<00:02:29.010> red<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:30.570> entered<00:02:31.050> into<00:02:31.200> cell<00:02:32.150> c3<00:02:33.150> what's<00:02:33.900> c3

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
in red is entered into cell c3 what's c3

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
in red is entered into cell c3 what's c3
so<00:02:34.620> did<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.130> 3<00:02:35.640> right<00:02:36.360> here<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.810> let's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so did you see 3 right here so let's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.810 
so did you see 3 right here so let's
just<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.380> an<00:02:37.470> X<00:02:37.650> here<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.620> now<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:42.120> X<00:02:42.720> here<00:02:43.320> is

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
just put an X here so now this X here is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.680 
just put an X here so now this X here is
copied<00:02:44.820> into<00:02:46.100> d5<00:02:47.100> what's<00:02:47.760> d5<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.810> d5

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
copied into d5 what's d5 so this is d5

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.830 
copied into d5 what's d5 so this is d5
let's<00:02:51.690> put<00:02:52.760> an<00:02:53.760> X<00:02:53.970> here<00:02:54.060> whatever

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
let's put an X here whatever

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.710 
let's put an X here whatever
let's<00:02:55.050> put<00:02:55.260> X<00:02:55.440> here<00:02:55.530> again<00:02:55.940> okay<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.330> did

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
let's put X here again okay so what did

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.850 
let's put X here again okay so what did
we<00:02:57.750> do<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.560> moved<00:02:58.860> from<00:03:00.500> we've<00:03:01.500> moved<00:03:01.709> like

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
we do we moved from we've moved like

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.880 
we do we moved from we've moved like
this<00:03:02.510> 1<00:03:03.510> 2<00:03:04.670> &amp;<00:03:05.670> 3<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.900> move<00:03:07.080> one<00:03:08.300> row<00:03:09.890> two

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
this 1 2 &amp; 3 so you move one row two

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.580 
this 1 2 &amp; 3 so you move one row two
columns<00:03:11.340> down<00:03:11.580> one<00:03:12.330> two<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.989> then<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.320> we

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
columns down one two and then you we

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.060 
columns down one two and then you we
have<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.770> 1<00:03:14.070> here<00:03:14.100> okay<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.500> let's<00:03:16.739> go<00:03:16.890> back

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
have a 1 here okay so now let's go back

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.440 
have a 1 here okay so now let's go back
to<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> formula<00:03:17.489> remember<00:03:18.000> when<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.270> have

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
to the formula remember when we have

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.540 
to the formula remember when we have
dollar<00:03:18.660> signs<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.200> front<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.530> both<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.070> column

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
dollar signs in front of both the column

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.360 
dollar signs in front of both the column
and<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.209> row<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:22.260> remains<00:03:22.800> unchanged

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
and the row it remains unchanged

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.130 
and the row it remains unchanged
whatever<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:23.850> have<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.209> remains<00:03:24.510> unchanged

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
whatever we have there remains unchanged

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.520 
whatever we have there remains unchanged
and<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:26.190> when<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.489> only<00:03:26.640> have<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.209> either<00:03:28.200> one

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and then when we only have it either one

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.110 
and then when we only have it either one
of<00:03:28.560> them

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
of them

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.140 
of them
this<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:31.739> remains<00:03:32.130> unchanged<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.000> then

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this here remains unchanged but then

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.280 
this here remains unchanged but then
this<00:03:33.360> changes<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.480> if<00:03:36.480> we<00:03:36.750> understand<00:03:37.170> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
this changes so if we understand that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.990 
this changes so if we understand that
then<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.799> basically<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.730> guess

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
then you can basically kind of guess

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.970 
then you can basically kind of guess
what<00:03:39.360> would<00:03:39.600> be<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> formula<00:03:40.140> right<00:03:40.410> here<00:03:40.470> but

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
what would be the formula right here but

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.650 
what would be the formula right here but
you<00:03:41.310> know<00:03:41.430> we're<00:03:41.820> just<00:03:41.850> going<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.120> work<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.540> out

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
you know we're just going to work it out

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660 
you know we're just going to work it out
and<00:03:42.900> see<00:03:43.049> what<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.830> then<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.549> of

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
and see what we have and then this of

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.770 
and see what we have and then this of
course<00:03:44.940> you're<00:03:45.060> gonna<00:03:45.150> have<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.450> move<00:03:45.630> it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
course you're gonna have to move it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.840 
course you're gonna have to move it
whatever<00:03:45.989> rows<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.220> columns<00:03:47.580> you've<00:03:47.700> moved

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
whatever rows and columns you've moved

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.960 
whatever rows and columns you've moved
the<00:03:48.030> initial<00:03:48.650> formula<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.250> remember<00:03:50.640> here<00:03:50.850> we

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the initial formula so remember here we

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.539 
the initial formula so remember here we
moved<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.420> from<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.769> copied<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.340> so

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
moved it from this is copied here so

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.390 
moved it from this is copied here so
we've<00:03:53.670> moved<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.000> one<00:03:54.860> one<00:03:55.860> two

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
we've moved it one one two

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.030 
we've moved it one one two
so<00:03:56.519> one<00:03:56.790> row<00:03:57.000> two<00:03:57.780> columns<00:03:58.140> down<00:03:58.320> one<00:03:58.739> row<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
so one row two columns down one row to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.890 
so one row two columns down one row to
the<00:03:59.130> right<00:03:59.160> two<00:03:59.940> columns<00:04:00.120> down<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.750> could

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
the right two columns down you could

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.830 
the right two columns down you could
have<00:04:00.989> also<00:04:01.170> done<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:03.769> two<00:04:05.239> -<00:04:06.239> what<00:04:06.750> is

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
have also done this like two - what is

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.000 
have also done this like two - what is
this<00:04:07.190> two<00:04:08.190> rows<00:04:08.459> down<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.299> mean<00:04:10.019> two<00:04:10.320> columns

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
this two rows down I mean two columns

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.240 
this two rows down I mean two columns
down<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:13.250> one<00:04:14.250> row<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> right<00:04:16.010> either<00:04:17.010> way

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
down and one row to the right either way

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.819 
down and one row to the right either way
it's<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.400> same<00:04:17.640> thing<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> end<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.829> okay

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
it's the same thing you end up here okay

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.099 
it's the same thing you end up here okay
so<00:04:20.130> now<00:04:20.790> let's<00:04:21.090> see<00:04:21.239> what<00:04:21.269> we<00:04:21.510> have<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.930> get

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
so now let's see what we have to get

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:29.700 
so now let's see what we have to get
that<00:04:22.350> red<00:04:22.979> X<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.860> we<00:04:26.100> have

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.670 

8:4<00:04:31.389> right<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:32.689> we<00:04:32.810> have<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.139> four<00:04:33.969> here<00:04:37.389> okay

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
8:4 right so we have a four here okay

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.760 
8:4 right so we have a four here okay
and<00:04:39.680> we<00:04:39.830> have<00:04:39.860> b2<00:04:40.840> with<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> dollar<00:04:42.139> sign<00:04:42.469> and<00:04:44.770> b2

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and we have b2 with a dollar sign and b2

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.230 
and we have b2 with a dollar sign and b2
without<00:04:46.039> a<00:04:46.069> dollar<00:04:46.249> sign<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:46.789> what<00:04:46.969> does<00:04:47.120> that

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
without a dollar sign so what does that

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.550 
without a dollar sign so what does that
mean<00:04:47.449> is<00:04:47.779> that<00:04:48.020> here<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:50.210> doesn't<00:04:51.139> change<00:04:51.169> at

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
mean is that here this doesn't change at

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.820 
mean is that here this doesn't change at
all<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.860> whatever<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.550> have<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:53.060> d5<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.680> would

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
all so whatever you have in d5 you would

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.939 
all so whatever you have in d5 you would
have<00:04:55.129> a<00:04:55.930> dollar<00:04:56.930> sign<00:04:57.229> for<00:04:58.129> dollar<00:04:58.520> sign<00:04:59.949> okay

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
have a dollar sign for dollar sign okay

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.439 
have a dollar sign for dollar sign okay
so<00:05:01.009> now<00:05:01.460> let's<00:05:01.699> use<00:05:01.879> green<00:05:03.879> so<00:05:04.879> this<00:05:05.180> right

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
so now let's use green so this right

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.170 
so now let's use green so this right
here<00:05:05.509> doesn't<00:05:06.050> change<00:05:06.379> because<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:07.180> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
here doesn't change because of the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.510 
here doesn't change because of the
dollar<00:05:08.389> sign<00:05:08.509> so<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:08.930> have<00:05:09.520> automatically

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
dollar sign so you have automatically

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:21.999 
dollar sign so you have automatically
you<00:05:10.759> have<00:05:10.789> a<00:05:18.849> four<00:05:19.870> okay<00:05:20.870> so<00:05:21.469> what<00:05:21.680> do<00:05:21.740> we<00:05:21.860> have

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
you have a four okay so what do we have

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.809 
you have a four okay so what do we have
here<00:05:22.189> we<00:05:22.400> have<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.789> first<00:05:22.969> one<00:05:23.240> would<00:05:23.419> be<00:05:24.819> B

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
here we have the first one would be B

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.059 
here we have the first one would be B
double<00:05:26.270> sign<00:05:26.449> -<00:05:26.689> so<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> dollar<00:05:27.259> sign<00:05:27.529> -<00:05:27.830> does

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
double sign - so the dollar sign - does

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.499 
double sign - so the dollar sign - does
not<00:05:28.249> change<00:05:28.580> because<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:29.089> have<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.300> dollar

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
not change because you have the dollar

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.390 
not change because you have the dollar
sign<00:05:29.749> so<00:05:30.020> automatically<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.800> can<00:05:31.039> put<00:05:31.219> that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
sign so automatically I can put that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.839 
sign so automatically I can put that
here<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:33.620> your<00:05:33.800> B<00:05:33.979> changes<00:05:34.460> because<00:05:34.699> there's

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
here so your B changes because there's

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.689 
here so your B changes because there's
no<00:05:34.969> dollar<00:05:35.210> sign<00:05:35.479> in<00:05:35.629> front<00:05:35.689> of<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.990> B<00:05:36.219> so<00:05:37.219> how

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
no dollar sign in front of the B so how

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.360 
no dollar sign in front of the B so how
do<00:05:37.759> we<00:05:37.879> do<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.270> here<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.860> two<00:05:40.069> doesn't

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
do we do that here the two doesn't

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.550 
do we do that here the two doesn't
change<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:40.819> whatever<00:05:41.509> however<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.379> change<00:05:42.710> it

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
change so whatever however you change it

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.629 
change so whatever however you change it
it<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:47.539> has<00:05:47.839> to<00:05:47.870> be<00:05:48.430> here<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:49.610> this<00:05:50.419> two<00:05:51.020> row<00:05:51.770> in

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
it it has to be here in this two row in

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.999 
it it has to be here in this two row in
row<00:05:53.419> number<00:05:53.719> two<00:05:53.899> it<00:05:54.050> has<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.349> be<00:05:54.469> over<00:05:54.770> here<00:05:54.919> it

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
row number two it has to be over here it

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.519 
row number two it has to be over here it
can't<00:05:55.219> be<00:05:55.339> here<00:05:55.669> because<00:05:56.629> your<00:05:57.020> -<00:05:57.199> doesn't

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
can't be here because your - doesn't

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.459 
can't be here because your - doesn't
change<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.889> gotta<00:05:58.159> be<00:05:58.339> a<00:05:58.580> C<00:05:59.210> or<00:05:59.389> D<00:05:59.479> now

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
change so you gotta be a C or D now

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:06.329 
change so you gotta be a C or D now
remember<00:06:00.979> your<00:06:01.339> red<00:06:02.020> was<00:06:03.020> moved<00:06:04.060> one<00:06:05.060> column<00:06:05.659> I

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:06.339 
remember your red was moved one column I

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.929 
remember your red was moved one column I
mean<00:06:07.339> one<00:06:07.639> row<00:06:08.029> to<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:08.930> right<00:06:09.069> so<00:06:10.069> your<00:06:10.250> B<00:06:10.520> has

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
mean one row to the right so your B has

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:18.760 
mean one row to the right so your B has
to<00:06:11.149> move<00:06:11.330> from<00:06:11.599> here<00:06:13.120> once<00:06:15.819> okay<00:06:17.379> it's<00:06:18.379> not<00:06:18.560> -

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
to move from here once okay it's not -

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.399 
to move from here once okay it's not -
it's<00:06:19.039> not<00:06:19.099> to<00:06:19.279> the<00:06:19.310> left<00:06:19.639> if<00:06:19.909> here<00:06:20.539> it<00:06:20.779> if<00:06:21.050> it

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
it's not to the left if here it if it

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.439 
it's not to the left if here it if it
moved<00:06:21.649> to<00:06:22.129> the<00:06:22.159> left<00:06:22.490> then<00:06:22.729> you<00:06:22.759> would<00:06:23.000> have<00:06:23.240> to

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
moved to the left then you would have to

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.179 
moved to the left then you would have to
move<00:06:23.569> to<00:06:23.779> be<00:06:23.930> to<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.199> left<00:06:24.409> but<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:24.830> didn't

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
move to be to the left but it didn't

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.059 
move to be to the left but it didn't
it's<00:06:25.969> to<00:06:26.449> the<00:06:26.539> right<00:06:26.810> so<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.319> have<00:06:27.680> to<00:06:27.830> change

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:28.069 
it's to the right so you have to change

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.090 
it's to the right so you have to change
it<00:06:28.250> to<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.520> right<00:06:28.819> so<00:06:29.120> you<00:06:29.210> have<00:06:29.419> C

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.180 

okay<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:33.480> now<00:06:33.750> from<00:06:34.200> here<00:06:34.290> you<00:06:34.650> can<00:06:34.800> tell<00:06:35.010> that

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
okay so now from here you can tell that

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.630 
okay so now from here you can tell that
the<00:06:35.370> answer<00:06:35.640> is<00:06:35.670> a<00:06:36.860> automatically<00:06:37.860> but<00:06:38.400> let's

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
the answer is a automatically but let's

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.360 
the answer is a automatically but let's
just<00:06:38.790> move<00:06:39.240> keep<00:06:39.930> going<00:06:40.230> with<00:06:40.680> our<00:06:40.710> logic

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
just move keep going with our logic

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.790 
just move keep going with our logic
okay<00:06:41.790> so<00:06:41.850> beautyrx<00:06:42.330> is<00:06:42.450> no<00:06:42.570> dollar<00:06:42.780> sign<00:06:42.900> so

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
okay so beautyrx is no dollar sign so

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.110 
okay so beautyrx is no dollar sign so
whatever<00:06:44.130> we<00:06:44.310> change<00:06:44.610> here

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
whatever we change here

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.920 
whatever we change here
run<00:06:45.780> roll<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.200> the<00:06:46.260> right<00:06:46.530> two<00:06:47.370> columns<00:06:47.670> to<00:06:49.700> the

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
run roll to the right two columns to the

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.390 
run roll to the right two columns to the
two<00:06:51.930> columns<00:06:52.290> down<00:06:52.500> we're<00:06:52.890> gonna<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.250> to

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
two columns down we're gonna have to

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.480 
two columns down we're gonna have to
change<00:06:53.640> the<00:06:54.000> b2<00:06:54.510> same<00:06:55.080> way<00:06:55.320> so<00:06:56.250> we<00:06:56.280> have<00:06:58.490> one

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
change the b2 same way so we have one

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.370 
change the b2 same way so we have one
here<00:07:00.240> and<00:07:00.450> then<00:07:01.370> one<00:07:02.370> two<00:07:03.270> so<00:07:04.260> it's<00:07:04.440> got<00:07:04.590> to<00:07:04.710> be

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
here and then one two so it's got to be

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.710 
here and then one two so it's got to be
here

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 
here

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:19.130 
here
what<00:07:09.720> is<00:07:09.840> this<00:07:09.990> c4<00:07:12.830> so<00:07:13.830> it's<00:07:14.010> a<00:07:14.100> c4<00:07:16.310> okay<00:07:17.330> so<00:07:18.330> the

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140 
what is this c4 so it's a c4 okay so the

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.670 
what is this c4 so it's a c4 okay so the
logic<00:07:19.590> is<00:07:19.740> is<00:07:19.980> pretty<00:07:20.840> it's<00:07:21.840> pretty<00:07:21.900> fun

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
logic is is pretty it's pretty fun

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.830 
logic is is pretty it's pretty fun
actually<00:07:22.890> fun<00:07:23.520> to<00:07:23.550> do<00:07:23.850> it's<00:07:24.150> just<00:07:24.210> like<00:07:24.480> excel

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
actually fun to do it's just like excel

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.470 
actually fun to do it's just like excel
sheet<00:07:25.080> so<00:07:25.890> I<00:07:25.920> have<00:07:26.220> to<00:07:26.400> you<00:07:26.730> get<00:07:26.910> it<00:07:27.060> um<00:07:27.240> so

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
sheet so I have to you get it um so

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.450 
sheet so I have to you get it um so
we'll<00:07:27.990> do<00:07:28.140> an<00:07:28.260> another<00:07:28.680> example<00:07:29.160> where<00:07:29.340> we

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
we'll do an another example where we

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.890 
we'll do an another example where we
don't<00:07:29.550> we<00:07:29.760> don't<00:07:29.850> have<00:07:30.060> to<00:07:30.180> work<00:07:30.330> it<00:07:30.480> at<00:07:30.570> all

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
don't we don't have to work it at all

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.010 
don't we don't have to work it at all
we're<00:07:31.350> just<00:07:31.470> gonna<00:07:31.590> guess<00:07:32.010> right<00:07:33.000> away<00:07:33.270> so

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
we're just gonna guess right away so

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.790 
we're just gonna guess right away so
that<00:07:34.230> you<00:07:34.890> see<00:07:35.070> how<00:07:35.100> it<00:07:35.760> works<00:07:36.150> really<00:07:36.390> okay<00:07:37.290> so

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800
