today we're going to dedicate some time
in<00:00:40.920> our<00:00:41.700> lives<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:43.379> try<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> take<00:00:43.980> care<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> one

in our lives to try to take care of one

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
in our lives to try to take care of one
big<00:00:44.730> thing<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.170> draining<00:00:46.710> money

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
big thing I think that is draining money

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
big thing I think that is draining money
out<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.309> our<00:00:47.520> bank<00:00:47.760> account<00:00:48.149> lack<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.899> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
out of our bank account lack of that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.150 
out of our bank account lack of that
completely<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.890> mean<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> sucking<00:00:51.360> us<00:00:51.510> dry

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
completely I mean it is sucking us dry

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
completely I mean it is sucking us dry
and<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.489> solving<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and what I'm solving them right now is a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.849 
and what I'm solving them right now is a
car<00:00:55.789> now<00:00:56.789> there's<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.449> there

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
car now there's some of you out there

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.860 
car now there's some of you out there
right<00:00:58.859> before<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.460> before<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> finger<00:01:00.780> at

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
right before it before put the finger at

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
right before it before put the finger at
you<00:01:01.050> let<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.770> point<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> finger<00:01:02.399> myself<00:01:02.550> first

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
