00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 Let's say, this world 

00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:21.300
 Let's keep rolling and sing songs of the journey 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 People around me a little worried 

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:57.000
 I was looking at the end of the wind 

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:07.200
 I received the shape of the cloud 

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:15.200
 In the middle of the road 

00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:24.500
 Let's sing when you want to meet old songs 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 The last appearance of the last train jumped alone 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 I was looking at the continuation of the ocean wave 

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:07.000
 I got stuck in my chest gap 

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:14.700
 It was a signpost for who 

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:24.500
 What if I ignored it 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.000
 Do not hesitate 

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:42.700
 Don't die as it is 

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:47.900
 Let's go
