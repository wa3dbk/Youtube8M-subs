00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
things that happens for instance is that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.719 
things that happens for instance is that
if<00:02:08.640> people<00:02:08.759> are<00:02:09.000> happy<00:02:09.299> they<00:02:09.599> invite<00:02:09.899> more

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
then you get this kind of population

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.250 
then you get this kind of population
boom<00:02:16.730> because<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.569> great<00:02:17.720> place<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> live

boom because it's a great place to live
and<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.010> population<00:02:19.519> boom<00:02:19.670> will<00:02:19.849> just<00:02:20.000> bring

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
and the population boom will just bring

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.140 
and the population boom will just bring
everything<00:02:20.420> back<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:21.379> again<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.819> start

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
everything back down again so we start

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
everything back down again so we start
to<00:02:23.239> stress<00:02:23.510> your<00:02:23.659> fire<00:02:23.840> systems<00:02:24.319> you're<00:02:24.470> hot

stressed which then forces you not in
Utopia<00:02:31.340> anymore<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:31.849> problems<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
Utopia anymore there's problems the

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.479 
Utopia anymore there's problems the
other<00:02:33.200> thing<00:02:33.379> with<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.799> of<00:02:33.890> people<00:02:34.010> start

other thing with a lot of people start
to<00:02:34.580> come<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.879> then<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> get<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.660> sewage

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
to come in then you get a sewage

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.930 
to come in then you get a sewage
problems<00:02:36.530> garbage<00:02:36.950> problems<00:02:37.400> things<00:02:37.819> like

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
problems garbage problems things like

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.300 
problems garbage problems things like
that<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:39.379> you're<00:02:39.530> always<00:02:39.680> kind<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.129> this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that so you're always kind of this

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.100 
that so you're always kind of this
constant<00:02:40.760> tension<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.299> right<00:02:41.840> when<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.079> think

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
constant tension of right when you think

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.229 
constant tension of right when you think
they're<00:02:42.349> going<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.500> get<00:02:42.620> happy<00:02:43.239> then

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
they're going to get happy then

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910 
they're going to get happy then
everything's<00:02:44.900> going<00:02:45.140> good<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> good

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
everything's going good but the good

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.580 
everything's going good but the good
brings<00:02:46.340> bad<00:02:46.790> along<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.599> but<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.530> think

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
brings bad along with it but I think

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.830 
brings bad along with it but I think
certain<00:02:49.040> players<00:02:49.420> simcity<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.599> game<00:02:50.810> about

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
certain players simcity is a game about

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.410 
certain players simcity is a game about
choices<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.769> some<00:02:52.099> players<00:02:52.340> they're<00:02:53.120> trying

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
choices so some players they're trying

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.270 
choices so some players they're trying
to<00:02:53.480> build<00:02:53.629> at<00:02:53.720> utopia<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.560> that's<00:02:54.980> what<00:02:55.160> their

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
to build at utopia and that's what their

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.099 
to build at utopia and that's what their
goal<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:56.209> for<00:02:56.390> other<00:02:56.480> players<00:02:56.720> they<00:02:56.959> have

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
goal is but for other players they have

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.839 
goal is but for other players they have
different<00:02:57.410> ideas<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.739> what<00:02:57.890> utopia<00:02:58.459> might<00:02:58.670> be

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
different ideas of what utopia might be

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.030 
different ideas of what utopia might be
so<00:02:59.660> for<00:02:59.959> some<00:03:00.079> people<00:03:00.109> utopia<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.769> maybe<00:03:00.950> a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
so for some people utopia is maybe a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.920 
so for some people utopia is maybe a
very<00:03:01.250> small<00:03:01.549> little<00:03:01.849> suburban<00:03:02.329> community<00:03:02.780> by

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
very small little suburban community by

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.720 
very small little suburban community by
a<00:03:02.959> beach<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.500> they<00:03:04.069> just<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> keep<00:03:04.519> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
a beach and they just want to keep it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.210 
a beach and they just want to keep it
peaceful<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.450> calm<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:06.739> other<00:03:06.829> players<00:03:07.099> a

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
peaceful and calm for other players a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890 
peaceful and calm for other players a
utopian<00:03:07.790> city<00:03:07.940> would<00:03:08.180> be<00:03:08.299> like<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> million

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
utopian city would be like a million

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.470 
utopian city would be like a million
people<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.530> no<00:03:09.680> crime<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.209> define

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
people and no crime so you can define

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569 
people and no crime so you can define
that<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.840> many<00:03:12.590> different<00:03:12.799> ways<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.340> we<00:03:13.459> don't

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
that in many different ways and we don't

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.569 
that in many different ways and we don't
really<00:03:13.790> stress<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.650> game<00:03:15.799> how<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.099> play<00:03:16.280> it

so<00:03:17.150> for<00:03:17.269> instance<00:03:17.329> there's<00:03:17.660> never<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.260> one

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
so for instance there's never a you one

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.409 
so for instance there's never a you one

look a little more futuristic and your

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.580 
look a little more futuristic and your
city<00:04:13.160> will<00:04:13.310> get<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.519> different<00:04:13.819> characteristic

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
city will get a different characteristic

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.770 
city will get a different characteristic
then<00:04:15.590> for<00:04:16.310> instance<00:04:16.519> like<00:04:16.669> or<00:04:17.090> city<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.720> a

then for instance like or city and a
coal<00:04:17.989> city<00:04:18.229> is<00:04:18.829> going<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.039> look<00:04:19.159> a<00:04:19.219> lot

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
coal city is going to look a lot

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.580 
coal city is going to look a lot
different<00:04:19.400> than<00:04:20.560> microprocessor<00:04:21.560> and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
different than microprocessor and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.090
