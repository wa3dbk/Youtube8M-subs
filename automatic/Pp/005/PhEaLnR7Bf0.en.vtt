00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
could not find it so yeah it took me a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.459

very<00:00:32.430> long<00:00:32.910> time<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.540> figure<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:34.020> where<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
very long time to figure out where the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.990 
very long time to figure out where the
other<00:00:34.620> optional<00:00:35.010> objective<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.079> video

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
is done by pressing any button so I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180 
is done by pressing any button so I
actually<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> 360<00:00:50.039> for

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
actually got one right for the 360 for

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
actually got one right for the 360 for
once<00:00:50.340> yay<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.360> me<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.699> two<00:00:53.820> optional

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.289 
only two more to go sequence 13 is just
a<00:01:25.530> cutscene<00:01:25.740> basically<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.640> doesn't<00:01:27.090> really

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a cutscene basically so doesn't really

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
a cutscene basically so doesn't really
count<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> sequence<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
count as a sequence so really only this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.530 
count as a sequence so really only this
one<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.759> 12<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.150> we're<00:01:30.360> done

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
one in 12 to go we're done

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.749 
one in 12 to go we're done
oh<00:01:31.280> that's<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> other<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> was

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759

three<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.650> two

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
three I don't know I think it was two

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.520 
three I don't know I think it was two
but<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.460> could<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.820> wrong<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.960> again<00:01:40.350> we're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but I could be wrong so again we're

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
but I could be wrong so again we're
doing<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.890> thing<00:01:41.100> where<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.729> forgot<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.630> we

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
doing this thing where I forgot that we

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.090 
doing this thing where I forgot that we
could<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.170> through<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.590> kill<00:01:43.890> everybody

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
could just go through and kill everybody

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.450 
could just go through and kill everybody
and<00:01:45.680> don't<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> worry<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.070> stealth

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and don't have to worry about stealth

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.020 
and don't have to worry about stealth
but<00:01:48.619> whatever<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.189> actually<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:50.909> easy

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
but whatever this is actually very easy

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
but whatever this is actually very easy
to<00:01:51.420> stealth<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> I've<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.530> done

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to stealth this and I've actually done

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.240 
to stealth this and I've actually done
it<00:01:53.060> before<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> stealth<00:01:56.009> this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it before so if you want to stealth this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
it before so if you want to stealth this
that's<00:01:56.549> fine<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.090> want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that's fine if you want to just go in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.179 
that's fine if you want to just go in
and<00:01:57.930> kill<00:01:58.049> everybody<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.799> easy<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> do

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and kill everybody very easy to do

this um I will be skipping sequence 11
memory<00:02:06.840> 2<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.220> basically<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.910> one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
memory 2 because it's basically just one

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.900 
memory 2 because it's basically just one
