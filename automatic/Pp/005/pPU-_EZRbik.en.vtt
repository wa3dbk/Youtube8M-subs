00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.769
 and 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.769
 and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.969
 or the friendly friends taxis of that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.149
 chiquita welcome to another tutorial 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.420
 good and cool let's see this pattern 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.340
 of pretty happy folk country rhythm and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 where are we going to use end-of-life technique 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.129
 this year is to say right hand but only 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 three fingers plus with this pattern of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.750
 rhythm you could play any song 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.839
 but country style thing that remains 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.390
 quite cheerful and quite horny 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.059
 let's zoom in and let's go 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 we are touching two lines the first 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.339
 line I'm going to put a the seventh I'm 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.070
 stepping on the seventh of which is the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.409
 fret three are fret three of the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 first rope and the pre-line above 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 the thumb is going to be touching tonic 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.540
 fifth to fifth tonic all the time without 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 stop 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.800
 and 2 1 and 2 right hand are not going to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.110
 move the first two strings 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.110
 more finite and we will be doing 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.420
 nothing more 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 if we add the two lines to this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.390
 counterpoint then slowly we would have 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.370
 those would be the first two measures and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 that would be the rhythm pattern really 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.890
 it is the pattern that is repeated throughout 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.370
 time 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.760
 we started the first compass I leave you the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.800
 table on our website also first 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.470
 compass with the seventh we have tonic 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.040
 now at the same time the fifth and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.040
 first rope 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.370
 tonic now fret 2 second string with 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.370
 finger 1 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.570
 fifth 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.570
 that would be the first compass 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:36.610
 and second compass clamping of tonic and 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.810
 first rope second rope 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.790
 kita 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.569
 first rope 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.569
 tonic second string and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.400
 the second measure would be 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.020
 I repeat 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.950
 if now we join the two measures is 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.930
 say the rhythm pattern as is 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.620
 slowly 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.620
 all right 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 I repeat 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.050
 look how the big toe the thumb is 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.050
 doing all the time 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.400
 and now he adds the melody from below 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.400
 i 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.120
 i 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.800
 We take this same pattern with a 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.020
 new chord for example a re seventh and 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150
 it's the same thing exactly the same thing just 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.740
 that now he lowered his thumb went down a 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.670
 step and is always doing 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.690
 always tonic fifth fifth tonic there 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 in the middle strings 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.020
 Quick 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.700
 then we would go back to the seventh is the 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.700
 typical progression 145 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.289
 and the fifth degree in me simply the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.440
 finger 1 we left it there and still 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.449
 It is always like the seventh king but 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.370
 we move a tone one or two we move it 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.849
 now until we were in from now on and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.849
 the same 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 we go back to the king 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.139
 two 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.620
 but this would be for this exercise this 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.020
 rhythm pattern is the important thing and it is what 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.420
 that allows you to play any song 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.050
 country version 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.580
 good taxi and give cane practice 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.070
 subscribe if you have not already done so 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.010
 I like it by the way on our website if you 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.260
 subscribe to the newsletter we give you 10 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.630
 beijing tracks very cool of different 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.300
 styles and if you want to dig deeper into 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.710
 different styles like the rock blues 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.690
 single pentatonic technique in the end of everything 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.220
 I look at our courses 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.840
 monographs on our website 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.840
 We are thus ciao
