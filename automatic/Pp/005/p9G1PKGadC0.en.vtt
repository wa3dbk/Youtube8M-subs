00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
pretty damn good we had four original

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.410 
pretty damn good we had four original
models<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.549> when<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:01.909> were<00:01:02.000> creating<00:01:02.299> this

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
models in when we were creating this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.329 
models in when we were creating this
thing<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:02.960> stead<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.830> stood<00:01:04.010> up<00:01:04.040> against

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
thing and it's stead it stood up against
