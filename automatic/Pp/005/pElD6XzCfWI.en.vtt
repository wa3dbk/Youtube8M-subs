00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.150
 good day today we have repair 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:15.139
 sony vaio laptop on the box is written 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 its e141 b11 in this 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.550
 then here we have an idea platform 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 foxconn m bx 270 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.400
 Well, in the description for the repair was written 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 laptop hit new result we 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.390
 found traces of water 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 or rather something akin to sap some 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.730
 cherry or some such composition is not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.309
 understand incomprehensible she became a mystery 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.320
 You can honestly repaired it. 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.219
 not only understand this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.430
 then how would it be repaired let's 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 show by the way 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.649
 the laptop somewhere about two weeks still lay 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 here we are service the same day three or four 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.250
 I lay somewhere 3 weeks passed 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.150
 and the liquid is not even dry that is when 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 we washed out 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.390
 Well, let's see the effects yet 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.729
 This is included here are the consequences of what 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 This I have already mounted three that is, the end 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 then a rarity divorced was I cleaned 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.610
 cleaned turned upside soldered 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.759
 that is, this site was damaged 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 then here the plot now we show here 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.720
 He here you see all living things just that traces 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 if not so here the connector we see yes 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.500
 that is, there is a blackened one somewhere 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.500
 still 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.510
 here too blackened ice blackened something 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:56.720
 there is here on the plume site prosperity should 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.450
 on my fluid all the floor he can see here 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.590
 already blackened from stripping very good luck 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.380
 steel is also visible there is liquid there 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.489
 plume here is this toast you a piece 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.400
 some kind of here it is liquid from some 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.830
 such a pinkish brownish color 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.110
 already remains for this that is what was 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.570
 done that is completely first was 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.090
 a photo of that site is taken 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.610
 Here I am, these are the main things that grow 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.769
 the plot was right here on the bios will start and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.790
 the resistor has been replaced all raised 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:42.370
 cleaned up lined everything was cleaned 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.560
 powder here consists of two bios one 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.049
 bios is a hub one bios is a cartoon 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.940
 the cartoon was raised too, this liquid itself 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.570
 just in this area got that is 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.850
 go cleaned up so leg here in this 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.910
 the plot here also was not on duty 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.510
 voltage somewhere now faster 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.510
 Munteanu 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:12.920
 it was here that the well fluid found 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.110
 still it was still showing no residue sone 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.959
 I mean that the scheme 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.720
 the principle of the 2012 laptop circuits on it 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.360
 it was not necessary to manually based 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.550
 let's say these datasheets plus as if 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.180
 or by analogy with some laptops 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.880
 mbx 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.450
 tayton others that is resists and just 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.850
 replaced 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:38.269
 how would know that there are newcomers or 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:41.480
 10 kilohms anyone with this there is also here 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:48.069
 next to the capacitor, too, the resistor was 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.069
 damaged see this left 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.090
 not yet dried even an hour will dry 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.580
 this wine he hit himself still have it 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.530
 good also alcohol but accordingly 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.100
 Easier you were multis precisely microcircuit 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.610
 bios 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.950
 This checked well, respectively, so 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:20.950
 checked all the result we have it 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:24.310
 turned on to the beginning we had here 445 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.200
 olympia here in duty voltage with us 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.510
 10 well, respectively, when we turn 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.020
 start up immediately by the image itself is not Vasya 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.890
 solved found here such here 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.040
 turned out repair selling it was not photographed 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.170
 because long enough capacious 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.740
 the processes 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.110
 After all schemes that is you find a site where 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.080
 corrupted look all check all 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.860
 it was a rather long hour here 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.070
 four all 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.740
 sat rechecking after this current he 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.080
 This and by the way the liquid under the cartoon was 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.870
 thought the cartoon will have to change but here 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:10.350
 lucky lifted cleaned everything and everyone 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:14.550
 then by the way he is a cartoon we called 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.550
 Nelatona Modelka 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.590
 somehow 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:30.900
 here is npc and 8950 one costs 51 to everything there 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.400
 there is also 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:41.490
 standing on the balls had to lift it 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.789
 where all wash see what 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.669
 consequences of what is beer what is it 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.110
 even after three weeks 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.599
 the laptop was lying without battery anyway 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.930
 the liquid was then possible on here in the case 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:57.449
 pillar opened here and that's all but already 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.680
 dried up because you need open here 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:06.120
 liquid has been on the cover here is not to be seen 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.620
 less they are not visible 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.400
 subscribe to our channel put 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.860
 huskies 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.330
 we will show more video as we 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.639
 we repair laptops because 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.909
 some more show how they are 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.009
 clean and such video is full of attack 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:24.889
 in reality how to repair a laptop 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.889
 no good bye
