know why she just lays it she's like a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590

fat man trapped in a horse body so I'm

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.860 
fat man trapped in a horse body so I'm
going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> teach<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.410> how<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:43.950> she<00:00:44.280> wants<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
going to teach you how if she wants to

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:53.000 
going to teach you how if she wants to
sometimes<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:46.230> want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:52.680> give<00:00:52.860> her

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.850> clicker<00:00:54.120> training<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you can use clicker training that is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
you can use clicker training that is
easier<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> guess<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.280> gives<00:00:56.520> them

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
easier I guess because it gives them

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
easier I guess because it gives them
something<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.320> ask<00:00:58.500> for

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
something but I just you know ask for

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.740 
something but I just you know ask for
the<00:00:59.329> command<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.359> waste

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the command and then and I don't waste

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
the command and then and I don't waste
any<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.409> anything<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.270> wait

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
