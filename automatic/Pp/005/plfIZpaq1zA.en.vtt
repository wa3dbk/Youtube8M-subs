exercises<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.310> with<00:00:19.460> my<00:00:19.580> students<00:00:20.090> I<00:00:20.300> go

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
exercises so with my students I go

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.540 
exercises so with my students I go
through<00:00:20.779> a<00:00:20.810> series<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.380> exercises<00:00:21.769> one<00:00:22.400> is

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
through a series of exercises one is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.150 
through a series of exercises one is
called<00:00:22.849> finger<00:00:23.240> lifts<00:00:23.660> where<00:00:24.470> we<00:00:24.680> go<00:00:24.830> through

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
called finger lifts where we go through

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.950 
called finger lifts where we go through
and<00:00:25.460> lift<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:26.689> Bend<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:28.640> muscles<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.449> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
and the doors of their cars so I'd order

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.830 
and the doors of their cars so I'd order
their<00:01:27.710> cars<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.940> students<00:01:29.690> can

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.560 
their cars so that the students can
practice<00:01:30.290> these<00:01:30.440> exercises<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.390> from

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
practice these exercises to and from

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.530 
practice these exercises to and from
different<00:01:32.780> activities<00:01:33.790> another<00:01:34.790> exercise<00:01:35.330> we

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
different activities another exercise we

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.170 
different activities another exercise we
do<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.960> called<00:01:36.260> finger<00:01:36.620> push-ups<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.460> here

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
do is called finger push-ups and here

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.150 
do is called finger push-ups and here
you're<00:01:38.330> really<00:01:38.420> getting<00:01:38.810> into<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.530> imitation

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
you're really getting into the imitation

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.060 
you're really getting into the imitation
of<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.090> movements<00:01:41.660> needed<00:01:41.930> for<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.710> student

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
of the movements needed for the student

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.370 
of the movements needed for the student
to<00:01:43.130> literally<00:01:43.700> move<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.300> pencil<00:01:44.840> when<00:01:45.260> they

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
to literally move the pencil when they

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.650 
to literally move the pencil when they
form<00:01:45.710> letters<00:01:46.160> so<00:01:46.820> they<00:01:46.940> go<00:01:47.120> back<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.570> forth

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
form letters so they go back and forth

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.350 
form letters so they go back and forth
and<00:01:48.290> then<00:01:48.740> you'll<00:01:48.890> work<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.310> circular<00:01:49.910> motions

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
and then you'll work in circular motions

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.960 
and then you'll work in circular motions
at<00:01:50.510> well<00:01:50.690> as<00:01:51.380> well<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:52.010> do<00:01:52.190> this<00:01:52.370> without<00:01:52.670> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
at well as well we do this without a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.870 
at well as well we do this without a
pencil<00:01:53.710> we<00:01:54.710> do<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.100> with<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> pen<00:01:55.670> or<00:01:55.700> pencil

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
pencil we do this with a pen or pencil

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.960 
pencil we do this with a pen or pencil
that's<00:01:56.390> not<00:01:56.540> sharpened<00:01:57.340> again<00:01:58.340> moving<00:01:58.730> back

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
that's not sharpened again moving back

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.300 
that's not sharpened again moving back
and<00:01:59.240> forth<00:01:59.570> looking<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.590> bending<00:02:01.070> and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and forth looking for the bending and

the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.740 
the
chuckles<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:03.490> we<00:02:03.520> also<00:02:03.820> move<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.270> paper

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
chuckles and then we also move to paper

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.190 
chuckles and then we also move to paper
and<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:06.399> work<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.850> moving<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.509> pencil<00:02:07.990> back

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
and we work on moving the pencil back

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.160 
and we work on moving the pencil back
and<00:02:08.470> forth<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:10.239> also<00:02:10.450> working<00:02:10.929> on

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and forth and then also working on
