00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.029
 the 2013-2014 season and it came to an end 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.080
 and it has left us many moments for the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 I remember in the bbva league 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.220
 a course that will be like the one 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.220
 premiere of the new San Mamés 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.860
 with this goal from charles on day 4 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.080
 this magnificent stadium was inaugurated 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 aims to take over from 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.920
 the old cathedral 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.760
 one of the proper names of the 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.670
 2013-2014 season is that of Victor 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.770
 valdés despite having disputed his last 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 season as Barça the goalkeeper 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.390
 de l'hospitalet made great performances 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.020
 compared as it is from stick to stick that 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.179
 signed in the benito villamarín 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 unfortunately the enormous trajectory of 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.960
 Valdez was truncated by an injury in 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.960
 the transcendental section of the competition 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.520
 another reference that says god is 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.980
 Puyol after 15 seasons 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.010
 the captain lived his last course with the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.160
 t-shirt by grana this was his last 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.160
 goal 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.439
 of some who are going to others who arrived 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.140
 Gareth Bale and Neymar were the great 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.080
 news that sparked the enthusiasm 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.850
 because of its star status despite its 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.860
 irregular performance both Welsh 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.330
 as the Brazilian already left flashes 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.330
 of what they can offer 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.110
 if it's about stars the athletic one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.420
 de madrid has undoubtedly been Diego Costa 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.580
 the front mattress combines all the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 qualities of your team character and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.930
 effort not exempt from talent 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.629
 Proof of this is this Chilean 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.459
 anthology of the Spanish-Brazilian that with 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.200
 amazing agility rose up in the 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.200
 air to sign this marvel 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.410
 another team that has proven its worth 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.209
 is the villarreal the set of 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 marcelino garcía toral has got 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.020
 reach the access points to europe 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.800
 league in his first season after 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.800
 promotion to first 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.239
 there have also been other teams 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.739
 revelations like lightning or Celtic 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.780
 both knew how to recover from an evil 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.099
 beginning of the season and persisted until 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.099
 save yourself in a comfortable way 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.650
 sets of paco jémez and luis enrique 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 they have also captivated by their football 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.890
 attractive 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.250
 and this is the highlight that we have been 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.920
 left these 38 league days a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.360
 season full of soccer goals and 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.360
 emotions until the last breath
