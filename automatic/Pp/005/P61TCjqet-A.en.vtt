00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
camera cut out this is a glossy plastic
material<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> nice<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.600> this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
material but it is nice with this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
material but it is nice with this
because<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.040> gloss<00:01:14.369> on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
because you don't have that gloss on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
because you don't have that gloss on
your<00:01:14.909> edges<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:15.720> generally<00:01:16.170> going

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to have you know it to drop so that's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
to have you know it to drop so that's
not<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> happen<00:01:19.799> scratched<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.850> much<00:01:21.090> as

not going to happen scratched as much as
some<00:01:21.479> cases<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> add<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> gloss<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.860> around

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
some cases to add the gloss all around

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
some cases to add the gloss all around
the<00:01:23.250> edges<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.330> nice<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> rubberized

the edges it's nice with that rubberized
material<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> has<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.900> say<00:01:28.049> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
material that it has so like I say it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.490

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for a case just a tad bit less thick and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
for a case just a tad bit less thick and
less<00:01:34.829> protective<00:01:35.340> than<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> case<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.150> case

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
less protective than this case in case

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
less protective than this case in case
also<00:01:36.600> recently<00:01:37.439> introduced<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> meta<00:01:38.850> slider

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
also recently introduced the meta slider

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.469 
also recently introduced the meta slider
and<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.689> five<00:01:40.560> dollars<00:01:40.770> cheaper<00:01:41.479> 3495

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and that's five dollars cheaper 3495

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.740 
and that's five dollars cheaper 3495
maybe<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.500> worth<00:01:43.710> checking<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:45.479> great

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
maybe one worth checking out but great

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
maybe one worth checking out but great
