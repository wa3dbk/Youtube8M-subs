called scoring and this allows the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.479 
called scoring and this allows the
debris<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.390> stay<00:02:56.019> intact<00:02:56.620> sometimes<00:02:57.220> when<00:02:57.400> you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
debris to stay intact sometimes when you

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.850 
debris to stay intact sometimes when you
baked<00:02:57.670> brie<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.480> ryan<00:02:58.780> gets<00:02:58.959> all<00:02:59.170> puffy<00:02:59.620> and

and you get like this puddle of oil on

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.860 
and you get like this puddle of oil on
the<00:04:25.620> bottom<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.940> want<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.210> make<00:04:27.360> sure<00:04:27.390> that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
the bottom so you want to make sure that

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.150 
the bottom so you want to make sure that
it's<00:04:28.080> warm<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.760> cooked<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.900> hot<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.680> soft<00:04:31.980> in
