00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:11.080
 Today we will see remote control boats 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.610
 made with these materials and with these 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.160
 materials 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.730
 forgive the quality of the video and I'm 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.160
 recording with a 4 does not look very good 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.500
 good let's start here we already have one 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.610
 our built will see 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.610
 here my partner 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.200
 as you will see everything is equipped by the 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.700
 remote control and all that good partner 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.700
 please show a magic 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.320
 to our little pool 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.320
 as you can see 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.409
 I repeat forgiveness in reality the video does not 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.039
 it is a very good camera that we arrived is 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.039
 a 4 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.920
 and associated 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 works 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 and understands the somewhat pirate theme 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.650
 As you can see we are just perfecting 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.370
 the project 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 today we are going to spend 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's a project that needs station 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 on a remote control with a couple of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080
 batteries 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 one more card your belly is concerned 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 two of two levels 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.520
 that would be everything 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.520
 in the normal route 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.100
