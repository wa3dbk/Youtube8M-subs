improved<00:00:18.390> upon<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> first<00:00:19.140> model<00:00:19.880> part<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
improved upon on the first model part of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.599 
improved upon on the first model part of
which<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.930> bearing<00:00:22.199> system<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:23.369> bearing

to a bear a bronze bearing which is what

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550 
to a bear a bronze bearing which is what
most<00:00:27.269> people<00:00:27.539> use<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> industry<00:00:28.380> for

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
most people use in the industry for

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.950 
most people use in the industry for
these<00:00:29.279> bills<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:30.179> using<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.570> actual<00:00:30.720> real

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
these bills we're using an actual real

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040 
these bills we're using an actual real
ball<00:00:31.170> bearing<00:00:31.470> bearings<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> does

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
ball bearing bearings and what that does

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
ball bearing bearings and what that does
it<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.500> makes<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> makes<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:36.180> more

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it just makes it makes it actually more

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
it just makes it makes it actually more
durable<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.890> feel<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.250> more

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
durable we can we feel a little more

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
durable we can we feel a little more
confident<00:00:38.820> by<00:00:38.879> putting<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.270> motor<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.840> or

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
confident by putting a motor on this or

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
confident by putting a motor on this or
motor<00:00:40.290> izing<00:00:40.649> our<00:00:40.860> mill<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:42.149> its<00:00:42.300> basic<00:00:42.480> at

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
motor izing our mill and its basic at

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
motor izing our mill and its basic at
the<00:00:42.899> end<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.680> shaft<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.370> each<00:00:44.640> end<00:00:44.879> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the end of the shaft of on each end of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.160 
the end of the shaft of on each end of
the<00:00:45.059> mill<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:46.160> encased<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.430> aluminum<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the mill it's encased in aluminum so the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
the mill it's encased in aluminum so the
bearing<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.800> pressed<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.309> an<00:00:50.489> aluminum

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
bearing is pressed into an aluminum

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.630 
bearing is pressed into an aluminum
aluminum<00:00:51.329> side<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> they're<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
aluminum side so they're in there and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.939 
aluminum side so they're in there and
what<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.600> does<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> dissipates<00:00:55.800> heat

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
what that does is it dissipates heat

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.880 
what that does is it dissipates heat
very<00:00:56.129> well<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:57.390> also<00:00:57.600> went<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> long<00:00:58.620> handle

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
very well we also went to a long handle

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
very well we also went to a long handle
a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.250> easier<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> crank<00:01:00.260> definitely

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a little easier to crank definitely

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.609 
a little easier to crank definitely
gives<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.850> leverage<00:01:03.059> as

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
gives you a little bit more leverage as

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.020 
gives you a little bit more leverage as
opposed<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> short<00:01:05.010> handle<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.909> those

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
opposed to a short handle for those

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.539 
opposed to a short handle for those
people<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.140> mill

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
people that are going to use this mill

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
people that are going to use this mill
and<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.210> hand<00:01:09.450> crank<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.260> definitely

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and just do hand crank this definitely

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649 
and just do hand crank this definitely
is<00:01:10.799> an<00:01:10.890> improvement<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:12.000> no<00:01:12.180> longer<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> an

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
is an improvement that no longer is an

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.940 
is an improvement that no longer is an
optional<00:01:13.080> thing<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.710> giving

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
optional thing we actually are giving

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.969 
optional thing we actually are giving
that<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.460> handle<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.570> free<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.799> also

want to do with it we also a big
improvement<00:02:23.709> we've<00:02:24.010> done<00:02:24.159> is<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.150> ends<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
improvement we've done is on the ends of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.410 
improvement we've done is on the ends of
the<00:02:25.629> mill<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.110> opposed<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.340> just<00:02:27.610> kind<00:02:28.360> of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the mill as opposed to just kind of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.289 
the mill as opposed to just kind of
guessing<00:02:28.629> or<00:02:29.019> mark<00:02:29.230> making<00:02:29.620> marks<00:02:29.829> on<00:02:30.010> our<00:02:30.129> own

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
guessing or mark making marks on our own

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.910 
guessing or mark making marks on our own
what<00:02:31.299> we've<00:02:31.450> done<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.780> we've<00:02:31.930> done<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.349> thumb

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
what we've done is we've done a thumb

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.069 
what we've done is we've done a thumb
screw<00:02:33.220> adjustment<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:33.970> front<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.959> what

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
screw adjustment in the front and what

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.319 
screw adjustment in the front and what
that<00:02:35.200> does<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.439> loosens<00:02:35.829> up<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.329> the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
that does it loosens up the the

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.470 
that does it loosens up the the
eccentric<00:02:37.840> cam<00:02:38.189> on<00:02:39.189> the<00:02:39.609> on<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.819> roller<00:02:40.180> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
eccentric cam on the on the roller and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
eccentric cam on the on the roller and
so<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.870> gives<00:02:40.959> me<00:02:41.140> an<00:02:41.230> ability<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.829> adjust<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
so it gives me an ability to adjust the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.699 
so it gives me an ability to adjust the
rollers<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.359> out<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.049> farther<00:02:44.439> away

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
rollers in and out and the farther away

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.670 
rollers in and out and the farther away
the<00:02:45.220> two<00:02:45.400> rollers<00:02:45.790> are<00:02:45.970> from<00:02:46.239> each<00:02:46.359> other

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the two rollers are from each other

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.830 
the two rollers are from each other
though<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.010> larger<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.790> crack<00:02:49.030> The<00:02:49.569> Closer

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
though the larger the crack The Closer

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.349 
though the larger the crack The Closer
that<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.799> rollers<00:02:51.340> are<00:02:51.489> together<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
that the the rollers are together the

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.589 
that the the rollers are together the
the<00:02:52.659> finer<00:02:52.930> or<00:02:53.049> or<00:02:54.010> yeah<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:54.489> closer<00:02:55.180> or<00:02:55.389> finer

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
the finer or or yeah or closer or finer

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.890 
the finer or or yeah or closer or finer
the<00:02:55.870> crack<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:57.609> now<00:02:57.760> adjust<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.720> once

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the crack so you can now adjust it once

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.559 
the crack so you can now adjust it once
you<00:02:59.019> adjust<00:02:59.170> it<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:01.030> can<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.389> have<00:03:01.540> a

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
you adjust it you can you have a

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.720 
you adjust it you can you have a
reference<00:03:02.139> point<00:03:02.260> there's<00:03:02.709> actual<00:03:03.069> decimal

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
reference point there's actual decimal

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.629 
reference point there's actual decimal
point<00:03:03.970> marks<00:03:04.689> and<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.170> can<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.859> use<00:03:06.129> this

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
point marks and you can you can use this

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.280 
point marks and you can you can use this
as<00:03:06.879> a<00:03:06.909> reference<00:03:07.359> for<00:03:07.599> your<00:03:07.720> next<00:03:08.019> batch<00:03:08.260> of

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
as a reference for your next batch of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.229 
as a reference for your next batch of
beer<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:09.250> find<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.760> found<00:03:09.939> a<00:03:10.030> crack

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
beer if you find that you found a crack

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.270 
beer if you find that you found a crack
that<00:03:10.480> was<00:03:10.629> either<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.349> know<00:03:11.409> too<00:03:11.470> fine<00:03:11.859> or<00:03:12.099> two

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that was either you know too fine or two

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.800 
that was either you know too fine or two
course<00:03:12.579> this<00:03:13.150> definitely<00:03:13.359> has<00:03:13.659> an

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
course this definitely has an

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.920 
course this definitely has an
improvement<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.760> we<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> one-date<00:03:16.689> one

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
improvement so we have a one-date one

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.479 
improvement so we have a one-date one
side<00:03:17.199> and<00:03:17.440> one<00:03:17.560> on<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.680> other<00:03:17.769> both<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.340> them

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
side and one on the other both of them

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.970 
side and one on the other both of them
have<00:03:18.699> their<00:03:18.910> own<00:03:19.019> graduation<00:03:20.019> marks<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:20.829> it

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
have their own graduation marks on it

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.780 
have their own graduation marks on it
and<00:03:21.879> once<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.239> find<00:03:22.540> your<00:03:22.660> perfect<00:03:23.230> crack

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and once you find your perfect crack

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.220 
and once you find your perfect crack
then<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.079> can<00:03:26.230> adjust<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:28.230> then

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
then then you can adjust it and then

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.839 
then then you can adjust it and then
adjust<00:03:29.590> your<00:03:29.799> thumb<00:03:30.099> screws<00:03:30.430> tighten<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
adjust your thumb screws tighten the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.970 
adjust your thumb screws tighten the
damn<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.480> doesn't<00:03:31.659> require<00:03:31.840> any<00:03:32.199> tools<00:03:32.230> which

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
damn it doesn't require any tools which

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.460 
damn it doesn't require any tools which
I<00:03:33.159> like<00:03:33.449> some<00:03:34.449> of<00:03:34.480> my<00:03:34.540> competitors<00:03:34.780> definitely

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
I like some of my competitors definitely

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.559 
I like some of my competitors definitely
have<00:03:35.560> screws<00:03:35.879> just<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:36.940> little<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.389> more

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
have screws just a little little more

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.539 
have screws just a little little more
convenient<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.109> way<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:39.280> other<00:03:39.400> thing

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
convenient do this way the other thing

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.699 
convenient do this way the other thing
that<00:03:39.579> we've<00:03:39.730> done<00:03:39.900> with<00:03:40.900> unit<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.290> they<00:03:41.409> put<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
that we've done with unit is they put it

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.530 
that we've done with unit is they put it
put<00:03:41.919> a<00:03:42.010> protective<00:03:42.340> coating<00:03:42.639> on<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.479> the

put a protective coating on the on the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.080 
put a protective coating on the on the
aluminum<00:03:44.349> so<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.829> doesn't<00:03:45.010> get<00:03:45.099> scratched<00:03:45.310> so

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
aluminum so it doesn't get scratched so

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.199 
aluminum so it doesn't get scratched so
in<00:03:46.449> transit<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:48.400> could<00:03:48.609> actually<00:03:48.760> lead<00:03:49.060> the

in transit you could actually lead the
plastic<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.629> if<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.870> wanted<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.290> but<00:03:50.709> it's<00:03:51.129> a

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
plastic on if you wanted to but it's a

blue plastic peel it off when you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.589 
blue plastic peel it off when you
assemble<00:03:53.229> the<00:03:53.440> unit<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.790> while<00:03:55.359> i'm<00:03:55.419> going<00:03:55.540> to

assemble the unit and while i'm going to

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.119 
assemble the unit and while i'm going to
show<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.720> real<00:03:55.930> quick<00:03:55.959> how<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.379> add<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> mill

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
show you real quick how to add a mill

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.119 
show you real quick how to add a mill
with<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:58.209> i've<00:03:58.449> got<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.599> bucket<00:03:58.840> here<00:03:59.129> this

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
with it and i've got a bucket here this

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.439 
with it and i've got a bucket here this
is<00:04:00.280> my<00:04:00.400> bucket<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.879> this<00:04:00.970> is<00:04:01.090> kind<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.329> a

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
is my bucket and this is kind of a

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.300 
is my bucket and this is kind of a
standard<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.409> is<00:04:02.560> actually<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> six<00:04:03.040> gallon

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
standard this is actually a six gallon

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.199 
standard this is actually a six gallon
but<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.609> use<00:04:03.699> a<00:04:03.729> 69<00:04:04.510> five-gallon<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> i

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
but you can use a 69 five-gallon so i

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.240 
but you can use a 69 five-gallon so i
got<00:04:07.540> two<00:04:07.720> different<00:04:07.870> versions<00:04:08.440> if<00:04:08.769> i<00:04:09.010> want<00:04:09.190> to

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
got two different versions if i want to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.939 
got two different versions if i want to
connect<00:04:09.549> my<00:04:09.729> my<00:04:10.180> handle<00:04:10.510> on<00:04:10.629> just<00:04:10.659> just<00:04:11.049> attach

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
connect my my handle on just just attach

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.159 
connect my my handle on just just attach
that<00:04:12.220> now<00:04:12.729> I've<00:04:12.849> got<00:04:13.000> me<00:04:13.090> handle<00:04:13.479> for<00:04:13.810> cranking

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
that now I've got me handle for cranking

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:20.039 
that now I've got me handle for cranking
or<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:15.099> adjust<00:04:15.549> my<00:04:15.690> my<00:04:16.709> my<00:04:17.709> drill<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.250> fit<00:04:18.430> it

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
or I adjust my my my drill to fit it

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.390 
or I adjust my my my drill to fit it
and<00:04:21.009> i'm<00:04:21.459> using<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.849> slow<00:04:22.330> rpm<00:04:22.599> drill<00:04:23.319> I've<00:04:24.190> got

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
and i'm using a slow rpm drill I've got

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.189 
and i'm using a slow rpm drill I've got
a<00:04:24.430> got<00:04:24.879> to<00:04:25.030> jesam<00:04:25.330> so<00:04:25.479> my<00:04:25.569> drill<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:26.050> like<00:04:26.169> a

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
a got to jesam so my drill it's like a

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.409 
a got to jesam so my drill it's like a
number<00:04:26.379> one<00:04:26.530> number<00:04:26.650> two<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.520> tend<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.330> think

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
number one number two so I tend to think

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.809 
number one number two so I tend to think
that<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.110> mill<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.740> going<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.949> work<00:04:30.039> best<00:04:30.099> at

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
that this mill is going to work best at

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.309 
that this mill is going to work best at
about<00:04:31.150> 250<00:04:31.569> to<00:04:32.020> maximum<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.770> 500<00:04:33.220> rpm<00:04:34.319> the

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
about 250 to maximum of 500 rpm the

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.260 
about 250 to maximum of 500 rpm the
lower<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.770> RPM<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.280> find<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:36.819> you<00:04:36.940> get<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.090> more

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
lower the RPM I find that you get a more

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.659 
lower the RPM I find that you get a more
consistent<00:04:37.569> crack<00:04:38.009> of<00:04:39.009> course<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.370> just

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
consistent crack of course you just

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.249 
consistent crack of course you just
practicality<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.509> haven't<00:04:40.780> go<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> little<00:04:41.080> bit

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
practicality to haven't go a little bit

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.520 
practicality to haven't go a little bit
faster<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:43.389> know<00:04:43.599> but<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:43.840> think<00:04:44.199> in<00:04:44.349> the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
faster so you know but I think in the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.529 
faster so you know but I think in the
long<00:04:44.680> term<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.430> mill<00:04:45.819> will<00:04:45.940> last<00:04:46.120> longer<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
long term the mill will last longer the

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.999 
long term the mill will last longer the
bearings<00:04:46.840> last<00:04:47.050> longer<00:04:47.409> if<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.620> keep<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.919> at

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
bearings last longer if you keep it at

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.279 
bearings last longer if you keep it at
low<00:04:48.129> rpms<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:48.759> things<00:04:49.060> don't<00:04:49.180> overheat<00:04:49.599> so

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
low rpms and things don't overheat so

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.649 
low rpms and things don't overheat so
just<00:04:51.009> pretty<00:04:51.250> much<00:04:51.460> that's<00:04:51.759> it's<00:04:52.150> pretty<00:04:52.509> much

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
just pretty much that's it's pretty much

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.649 
just pretty much that's it's pretty much
attached<00:04:53.199> a<00:04:53.379> drill<00:04:53.620> pretty<00:04:53.889> pretty<00:04:54.280> easy<00:04:54.659> I'll

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
attached a drill pretty pretty easy I'll

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.409 
attached a drill pretty pretty easy I'll
show<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.050> kind<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:56.979> what<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.219> does<00:04:57.400> get<00:04:58.360> a

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
show you kind of what it does get a

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:06.649 
show you kind of what it does get a
little<00:04:58.599> bit<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:58.960> grain<00:04:59.229> here<00:05:00.389> pretty<00:05:01.389> simple

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.300 

and<00:05:07.659> one<00:05:08.319> of<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.500> things<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.979> you're<00:05:09.099> trying

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
and one of the things that you're trying

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.730 
and one of the things that you're trying
to<00:05:09.400> go<00:05:09.580> for<00:05:09.849> when<00:05:10.479> you<00:05:10.599> go<00:05:10.750> for<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.020> perfect

to go for when you go for a perfect
crack<00:05:12.099> these<00:05:12.370> are<00:05:12.969> going<00:05:13.180> for<00:05:13.449> a<00:05:14.099> three-part

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
crack these are going for a three-part

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.450 
crack these are going for a three-part
crack<00:05:15.400> with<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.270> whole<00:05:16.449> and<00:05:16.599> intact<00:05:17.069> and<00:05:18.069> a
