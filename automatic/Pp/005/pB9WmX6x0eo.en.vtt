00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.530
 condensed milk baking powder and flour take a bowl 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 and break it 2 eggs today I will 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 cook double servings therefore not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 pay attention to the fact that there is an ingredient 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:31.349
 more than i say then add 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 a glass of sugar and 200 grams of sour cream and all 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.880
 we beat it with a mixer, by the way 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.880
 the full recipe will be in the description 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.370
 add one teaspoon baking powder 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:54.760
 and half a can of condensed milk add 2 3 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.980
 cups of flour and everything is mixed with a mixer, but I 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.379
 would first advise you to stir and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.220
 only then begin to shoot down otherwise the whole 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.220
 flour angered 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.850
 and all our dough is ready and we pour it into 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.220
 mold and since i'm cooking double 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.720
 portion that first part I decided to do 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.150
 not chocolate so what will we do 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.090
 so that it becomes chocolate like this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.340
 question all limit from to questions add 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.340
 3 tablespoons cocoa 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.909
 and all this mix well but it will 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.890
 better if you beat this one with a mixer and 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.310
 Pour it all form as it is not 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.250
 silicone waist and smeared creamy 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.320
 butter to check this and our cake 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.240
 so a toothpick poke it all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.810
 icicles if nothing on a stick 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.459
 that you this our dough has cooled and now 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.929
 cut into three pieces before try 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.530
 not really everything will fall apart 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:11.700
 like mine, but itâ€™s better soaked and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 will be much tastier you can share it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.010
 in two parts if you fail 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.670
 for making cream like it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.970

 oil in advance so that it is soft so 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.640
