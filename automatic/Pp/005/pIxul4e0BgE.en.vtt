00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.590
 heide-marie or instructor at et al here Liberec and so on 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.210
 So I want you a little something from us from our working lives 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.039
 tell and should 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.489
 what is going on here all day my main task is bookings 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.159
 Percent over a new Finnish Verbeek 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.489
 at our main business the paper 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.599
 and percent we were then online in the world so is 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.720
 Thousands of euros and tons of paper must be very commonplace across the world 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 and we are all responsible for that 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.590
 So try a percentage of times that's a bit more blatant to bring more 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 at races on the new CD all Rome will find APA 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.230
 so our favorite 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.080
 Berlin 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.800
 then there are two locations where picture sheets about their publishers Steinbach 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.750
 Gothenburg 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.210
 and an old LÃ¼beck 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.430
 where we are 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.300
 Why 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 it would be when inhaling 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.380
 Ship the paper, so to speak 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.820
 George brought 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.620
 from point a to point b 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.570
 percent 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 The paper will unload us from all loaded containers 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.190
 our containers 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.150
 from here Elvis continued 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.140
 Aggravated at the controls 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 larger port for example Antwerp Rotterdam Hamburg 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.670
 and percent 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.150
 from there it goes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260
 the world outside has an alternative of shipments 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.690
 that the paper 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.290
 except northern Finnish Verbeek 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.030
 this is the second largest 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.310
 is also securitized on contractors that Intel 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.070
 around the paper 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.900
 to tighten to LÃ¼beck 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.329
 Here in April he was able to drive 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.770
 So there are some animals and theirs 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.030
 Norbert as were convicted over are two different routes 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.550
 and then 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.830
 the truck or the train here after how much 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.410
 How much money does the more there are to get to Hamburg 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.969
 then further aggravate if the world 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.130
 my job is that I asked Hofer Trap 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.270
 gets blurred spends 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.469
 the percent that 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.699
 that tie the paper underneath 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.009
 the Togolese or awakened 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.279
 us then only me as the container tilted over various shipping companies 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.169
 So container shipping companies percent in the world 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.839
 and percent is staying as the difficulty 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.239
 One finding the route with Smith are with the best TV time and there 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.159
 I enter the game Â» 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 as Lecturers Smelting gather in Bogota 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.419
 find the punctured transit traffic time and 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.419
 as he secure the container space 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.719
 and also 60 is the percent the more traffic 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.039
 because he's there and you do not do one thing 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:53.009
 World One thing at the time 9% One has six seven different percent documents 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.589
 the one percent and you jump back and forth and wait for an answer 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.849
 that is general in the forwarding sector 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.150
 Percent that one percent must be very flexible and its type and percent 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.340
 Also, in the short term, rethink four times and make a quick decision 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.379
 percent 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.559
 and even in training
