that they are slanted backwards or so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.919 
that they are slanted backwards or so
that<00:01:52.579> he<00:01:52.729> is<00:01:52.759> standing<00:01:53.030> straight<00:01:53.479> up<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.869> down

that he is standing straight up and down
on<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:56.000> underside<00:01:56.750> you'll<00:01:56.990> notice<00:01:57.320> that

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
on the underside you'll notice that

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.319 
on the underside you'll notice that
there<00:01:57.619> is<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.799> small<00:01:58.399> hole<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.090> meant<00:01:59.299> for

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
plugging in this little flat plate that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.620 
plugging in this little flat plate that
is<00:02:04.070> meant<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.429> look<00:02:04.579> like<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.939> third<00:02:05.149> leg<00:02:05.390> is

is meant to look like the third leg is
retracted<00:02:06.429> inside<00:02:07.429> of<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.030> r2<00:02:08.210> unit

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.449 

so<00:02:13.420> once<00:02:13.719> you<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.109> them<00:02:14.200> all<00:02:14.439> assembled<00:02:15.069> this

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
so once you get them all assembled this

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.030 
so once you get them all assembled this
is<00:02:15.640> what<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:15.909> get<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.420> beautiful<00:02:17.140> display<00:02:17.590> piece
