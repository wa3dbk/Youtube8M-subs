00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello with you alex beach when vkontakte 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.390
 removed all sorts of players for 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 downloading music I returned to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.780
 standard method began to load 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.360
 tracks via aytyuns 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.030
 almost all ios users do this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.170
 devices however over time you understand 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 what is it exhausting 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 these constant syncs are constantly 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.609
 you need to create and connect the cable even 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.650
 if you connect with aytyuns by wifi it 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 still not comfortable i managed to find 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.970
 much better solution is easier 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 upload songs directly from iphone no 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.380
 it will not be another player with music 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.210
 vkontakte yes if webstor at least 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:46.920
 one appeared then its instant 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 looks with the program youzef and i 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 met at the appstore a long time ago 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.539
 but having at that time in your device 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.170
 a whole selection of all kinds of players 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.550
 interacting with a huge base 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.280
 music vkontakte 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 me and so all arranged there was no sense 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 distracted by any such 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.150
 applications it is a pity but this joy was enough 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.920
 for a moment, well, no problem there 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.540
 simpler intuitive method 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 the program collects charts for different 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 style music built on ratings and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.500
 more auditions than 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.880
 ratings for a particular song, the higher it is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.880
 rises in the ranking 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.090
 Direct access to tracks from the top is available. 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.030
 and dance star as in each country 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.680
 the world of their tastes in terms of music 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 developers do not yawn rolled the whole 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.479
 a selection of countries if you are not particularly 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.179
 interested in the moment you turn it on 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.970
 son gold white then the program collects 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.130
 tracks from all countries put together in the end 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 It turns out a good music collection 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.990
 from which there is something to choose 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.539
 choose any of the songs each of them 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.179
 Available in a variety of versions. 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.850
 here you can either listen to the song or 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.860
 download and naturally such applications in 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.049
 first of all we are interested in 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.940
 download songs directly to 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.959
 phone memory therefore we choose 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.390
 downloadable 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.730
 here is what I said under the files 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.010
 posted ratings of songs by likes and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.500
 the number of plays you can download 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.049
 right from here by clicking on the clouds or 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.269
 directly from the player opens 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.720
 player here besides the usual controls 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.620
 which we see a regular ios player 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.840
 an equalizer is offered 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.570
 there are several types of each 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.690
 in your own special you can create your 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690
 own 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.780
 [music] 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 [applause] 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.620
 [music] 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.190
 we see the cover that 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 we often had to rock together 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.050
 with the track itself when using the method 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.630
 site ns when we want to sleep for example 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.570
 under your favorite music we turn on the sleep timer 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.570
 very cool to download click on 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:13.670
 share button choose download 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:20.650
 loading occurs in the files section where 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:23.840
 actually the song is downloaded 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.690
 sorting by date of loading by name 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.400
 size all swayed now I can not 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.190
 spending megabytes of your mobile 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.800
 Internet offline listen to the track from 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.990
 I like the memory of my gadget 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.150
 which is mediv a and works like a built 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.490
 player can close the program and all 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.040
 no shutdowns will play 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.530
 Further as you want you manage either 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:57.920
 through the control center or through the legs 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:04:00.590
 The screen in the app has a playlist and I 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.340
 already added a couple they are added so 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.240
 by clicking on the clouds choose this 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.460
 playlist 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.620
 further choose the playlist in which you 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.610
 want to download the corresponding track and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.610
 click ready 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.400
 ressens to show all that you 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.710
 listened from the very beginning of use 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.660
 of this program 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.730
 if what is offered in the charts is not for you 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.280
 like then use search 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:37.110
 where we enter the name of the artist or the name 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.790
 compositions we choose to finish this by 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.980
 my all that could be told about 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.260
 people five player is good enough 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.120
 of course there is one minus it was 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.340
 made by developers specifically with 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.440
 the goal is to make money very often 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.360
 advertising so that it does not appear in 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.030
 download the pro version for three dollars 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.950
 annoying but not really put the Huskies
