other day and we had Derek Briggs
spotting<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.430> do<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.490> feel<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.060> exercise

spotting you do you feel it on exercise

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.330 
spotting you do you feel it on exercise
like<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.440> good<00:02:07.560> idea<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.950> keep<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
like that it's a good idea to keep a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.340 
like that it's a good idea to keep a
spotter<00:02:08.610> behind<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> oh<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> definitely<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.320> I

spotter behind you oh I definitely do I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.040 
spotter behind you oh I definitely do I
think<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> sake<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.810> safety

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
think it's just for the sake of safety

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
think it's just for the sake of safety
in<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> gym<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.520> should<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
in the gym that you should have a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.060 
in the gym that you should have a
spotter<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.570> times<00:02:15.900> especially<00:02:16.530> when

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
spotter at all times especially when

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.440 
spotter at all times especially when
you're<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.640> intense<00:02:18.150> training

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
you're going in there intense training

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570 
you're going in there intense training
because<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.709> don't<00:02:19.830> didn't<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.340> you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
because if you don't didn't you do you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.800 
because if you don't didn't you do you
know<00:02:20.700> lose<00:02:20.940> control<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.510> bar<00:02:21.660> or

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
know lose control of the bar or

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.260 
know lose control of the bar or
something<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> very<00:02:23.250> good<00:02:23.790> chance

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
something there's a very good chance

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
something there's a very good chance
that<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> could<00:02:24.870> injure<00:02:25.140> yourself<00:02:25.470> seriously

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that you could injure yourself seriously

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
that you could injure yourself seriously
so<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.430> also<00:02:26.580> has<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.940> added<00:02:26.970> benefit<00:02:27.630> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
so it also has the added benefit of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.900 
so it also has the added benefit of
making<00:02:28.500> sure<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.340> squeeze<00:02:29.760> out

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
that extra rep you might otherwise be

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.900 
that extra rep you might otherwise be
