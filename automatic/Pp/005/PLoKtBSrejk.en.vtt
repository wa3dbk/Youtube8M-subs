00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:16.349
 the staff is wanted to show you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 here a knife that I had to do is this 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.820
 I drew the drawing for the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.579
 Hi, I'm looking for a new friend. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.669
 thank you he accepted the order 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.410
 of the knife and I really liked that knife. 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.719
 I drew it according to what I 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 I wanted a small knife to 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.050
 carry the backpack and do some 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 tasks 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.990
 when I do my walks of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 a name for this failure was not what 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.050
 My name is not my son who gave the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 name for that mane knife 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 He created that name there and we will have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 A knife shows you have a knife and a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 little is a small knife leaves 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 show the first bay we made 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.359
 for her in simple bay you can use 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 it both vertically in the belt and 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.609
 removing this strip here you can use 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.770
 it horizontally using these 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.369
 passers-by who are trapped in the bay 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.039
 I bought one for a little corgi there. 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.109
 to decorate and bring another material that 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:34.740
 people carry with the knife the knife is 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:38.729
 This one here is a knife in I think 1070 I think 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 quenching of carbon 70 throughout the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 I think you will not see the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.859
 line here but she's 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.499
 temperate tacoma hardness not very high 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.439
 I do not know how much paulo sousa is either 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.840
 I knew how to estimate this hardness, but it's really 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.649
 very hard because child retention 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.240
 It 's big and it's a good knife to use. 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:07.229
 easy to handle and what the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.009
 We think that best knife here this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.040
 choi and the cable format well police is 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:22.220
 An angled cable is insulated with 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:24.200
 with carnauba wax is the idea here 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.060
 It's a knife that stays completely inside. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.530
 of the hand to allow a lot of 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.520
 force her to have good control of her, right? 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.620
 even when you make a handle light slap 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.620
 because this show here allows this 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.260
 she has here or is majority on the back 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.280
 here is more that I can talk about this 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.560
 do it 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.970
 what is this format here is a mini ox 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.130
 That's what we wanted to present. 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.910
 knife there for you is the mane of ours 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.840
 small hem 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.610
 She's good, so, folks. 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.420
 participate with us the next 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.540
 adventures 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.580
 It is now raining quite here 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.590
 subject deserves better treatment for 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.500
 do not rust after we leave here 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.130
 The rain caught us by surprise today. 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.060
 It's a good idea to kill the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:30.700
 smell the delicious, it's cold 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.700
