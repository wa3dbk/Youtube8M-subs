probably you know it's up there I mean
this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.520> grave

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this is to me this is just a grave

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
this is to me this is just a grave
marker<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:01.680> me<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.219> lot<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.520> what<00:01:02.640> we're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
marker to me that's a lot of what we're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
marker to me that's a lot of what we're
looking<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.180> statues<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.899> grave<00:01:04.110> markers<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
looking at statues and grave markers I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.240 
looking at statues and grave markers I
believe<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.549> why<00:01:05.729> they're<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.270> area

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
believe that's why they're in that area

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.320 
believe that's why they're in that area
you<00:01:08.900> know<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.049> believe<00:01:10.170> there's<00:01:10.619> other<00:01:10.799> areas

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
you know I believe there's other areas

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.760 
you know I believe there's other areas
where<00:01:12.330> there's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.460> lot<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.729> action<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.990> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
where there's a lot more action and on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.060 
where there's a lot more action and on
Mars<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.470> picked<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.860> area

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
Mars but I think they picked this area

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.140 
Mars but I think they picked this area
for<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> reason<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> main

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
for a reason and this is one of the main

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
for a reason and this is one of the main
