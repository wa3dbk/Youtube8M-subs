it becomes this explosion of things to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.590 
it becomes this explosion of things to

consider with every single placement

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.880 
consider with every single placement
because<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.020> can't<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.380> everything<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.830> you

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
because you can't do everything so you

which one do you think um you know
what's<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.750> best<00:02:57.900> place<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.320> might

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
what's the best place that this might

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.530 
what's the best place that this might
score<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.160> me<00:02:59.190> considering<00:02:59.640> the<00:03:00.150> four

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
score for me considering the four

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.230 
score for me considering the four
different<00:03:00.900> ways<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.950> any<00:03:02.190> um<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.030> any

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
different ways that any um you know any

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.090 
different ways that any um you know any
guy<00:03:03.480> who<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.470> score<00:03:04.710> depending

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
guy who you put here can score depending

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.980 
guy who you put here can score depending
on<00:03:05.190> what's<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> bit<00:03:06.840> too

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
on what's it's just it was a bit too

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.360 
on what's it's just it was a bit too
much<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.650> definitely<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.040> game<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.340> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
much so this is definitely a game that I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.530 
much so this is definitely a game that I
think<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.670> know<00:03:08.760> if<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:08.910> ever<00:03:09.000> feel<00:03:09.390> like

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
think you know if we ever feel like

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.300 
think you know if we ever feel like
we've<00:03:09.720> mastered<00:03:09.960> it<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.830> definitely

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
we've mastered it there is definitely

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.770 
we've mastered it there is definitely
room<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.520> grow<00:03:11.790> because<00:03:12.030> there's<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.510> pro

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
room to grow because there's that pro

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660 
room to grow because there's that pro
variant<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.620> waiting<00:03:13.920> without<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
variant that's just waiting without the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.950 
variant that's just waiting without the
flip<00:03:14.880> side<00:03:14.910> there's<00:03:15.330> also<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.720> easier

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
flip side there's also the easier

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.330 
flip side there's also the easier
variant<00:03:16.260> where<00:03:16.380> it'll<00:03:16.890> let<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.040> place

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
variant where it'll let you place

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
variant where it'll let you place
diagonally<00:03:18.030> which<00:03:18.150> gives<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.900> much

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
diagonally which gives you so much

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.950 
diagonally which gives you so much
flexibility<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.100> much<00:03:20.250> kind<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.960> creative

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
flexibility and so much kind of creative

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930 
flexibility and so much kind of creative
freedom<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.650> really<00:03:22.860> quite<00:03:23.100> nice<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.550> mean<00:03:23.640> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
freedom it's really quite nice I mean to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.250 
freedom it's really quite nice I mean to
have<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.120> tiling<00:03:24.570> game<00:03:24.750> where<00:03:24.900> you're<00:03:25.020> allowed

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
have a tiling game where you're allowed

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.230 
have a tiling game where you're allowed
to<00:03:25.470> place<00:03:25.710> diagonally<00:03:26.430> yeah<00:03:26.490> it's<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.970> shame

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
to place diagonally yeah it's a shame

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.510 
to place diagonally yeah it's a shame
more<00:03:27.630> games<00:03:27.810> don't<00:03:28.020> do<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.470> mean<00:03:28.770> long<00:03:29.250> story

couple of copies

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.990 
couple of copies
I<00:03:36.600> mean<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.170> Jen<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:38.160> played<00:03:38.430> multiple

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
I mean if Jen and I we played multiple

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.280 
I mean if Jen and I we played multiple
with<00:03:39.420> both<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.690> people<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:39.960> often<00:03:40.170> I'd

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
with both of people more often I'd

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.380 
with both of people more often I'd
probably<00:03:40.470> get<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.740> second<00:03:41.040> copy<00:03:41.190> now<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.360> I

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
probably get a second copy now so that I

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.510 
probably get a second copy now so that I
could<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:42.810> four<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.470> these<00:03:43.620> decks<00:03:44.040> which

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
could have four of these decks which

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.520 
could have four of these decks which
will<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.820> make<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.450> thick<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.440> a

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
will just make it this thick and it's a

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.080 
will just make it this thick and it's a
game<00:03:46.710> you<00:03:46.860> could<00:03:47.010> carry<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.460> you<00:03:47.550> anywhere

like<00:04:12.480> place<00:04:12.990> on<00:04:13.170> water<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:14.190> scoring<00:04:14.880> was<00:04:14.940> a

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
like place on water the scoring was a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.840 
like place on water the scoring was a
bit<00:04:15.090> simpler<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.890> were<00:04:17.070> allowed<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.459> pick

guys back off the table so though this

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.770 
guys back off the table so though this
is<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:20.609> kind<00:04:20.730> of<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:20.970> cities<00:04:21.270> 2.0<00:04:21.660> they

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
is really kind of like cities 2.0 they
