00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.750
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.719
 recipe he is at home 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.730
 the wand a sky so that's it 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 you will need a rod 1 union in front 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 a red onion from the shredded county of the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 flambÃ© tart preparation 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.109
 if you do not find it in the shops 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 I put the recipe in descriptions 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 and bacon sticks smoke then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.210
 first step we will prepare the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.869
 garnish 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.670
 so we will cut both areas and 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.219
 then we'll just cut the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.770
 baguette so you cut it and like 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.809
 to make a sandwich in fact except that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 you will separate the two parts 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.219
 we then come on the bread went 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.719
 pie preparation 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.180
 this spreadable tale is all 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
 simply a mixture of craine 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 white cheese of pepper salt and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.950
 nutmeg 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.840
 but do not worry if you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.460
 not find in the trade I you 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.710
 would put a little recipe in bar 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 info and here we will come to put the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 garnish so we start with the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.200
 lardons then we just put the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.110
 onions and finish with the cheese and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 we will put them in a preheated oven 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.630
 at 200 degrees for 10 minutes were going 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.439
