00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.210
 good to all we are already here with another 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.100
 video and this time we're going to see the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.169
 Chilean avenue to allocate them and 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.879
 take our hair is not from jill scott 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:16.279
 to put the cube venus is a cube 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.119
 precious was very very very handsome has 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.890
 some very exotic shapes some stickers 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.300
 very good and very striking this cube already 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 have enough time for sure 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.910
 very much if not practically all already 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.619
 you know him well not of mayfair but 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.539
 well I wanted to show it because what 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.440
 we have had here here and me this cube 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:39.320
 I was very surprised by your turn 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.850
 tour spectacularly well for 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.160
 the ways it has to not be a cube 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.430
 of floors my name is also we can not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.079
 ask and the same as a bow but the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.210
 truth is that the turn the turn that has 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.160
 it's super correct this is basically a 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.800
 rubik's cube normal and current by itself 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.530
 Some did not know the only thing that was good 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.480
 the shapes of the pieces are so many 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.489
 exotic for example the corners and in 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.949
 place the corner instead of being the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.460
 classic square corner we do not have and 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.500
 this form 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 if we rotate the cube a bit it does not look like 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 is going to stumble everywhere it seems that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.979
 the girls out there but there but you see 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.130
 adjust fits perfect here you will not be 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.690
 is left with a salient is very very handsome 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.850
 it is from mayfair therefore the quality 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.740
 as autocad we can imagine is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 exceptional the color code that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.430
 has it is also different we do not have the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.850
 same the same colors with a bucket of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.530
 rubik but instead of having birds without 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 correct instead of having a top 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.679
 white we have a rose we have I do not know if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.990
 cool the weight in this cube weighs and weighs 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.869
 this weighs much more than this this by 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.250
 example in mayÃ¡ns h this weighs quite a 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 a cube 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.480
 of good weight we are going to make you here a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.160
 new pattern to see well the contrast 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.000
 of colors the truth is that it is very very 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.800
 pimp 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.230
 and what has impressed me has been 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 arise is why I made the video 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.910
 if this one did not have like this that has 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.820
 already a long time and good sure many what 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.229
 you will have many already you will have seen it then 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.110
 nothing is not that much is new 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.119
 but when I tried it when I turned it on 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.120
 turn to me I was quite surprised I do not know 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.280
 if it will have a cut if you see it has something 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 corner cutting 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.040
 we can not demand this either 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.100
 beige with layers a little out of phase 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.130
 this clear cube is very well 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.180
 good to collect or if it was the 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.010
 it's really cool 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.090
 The truth is that everything is the same 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.709
 I should have it because I do not 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.930
 the time with a very handsome cube you see 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.400
 then at the time of solving it as not 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.709
 It has white if we start on the face 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.780
 good pink maybe it can be a bit 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.420
 away but starting with the yellow 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.790
 well nothing much easier 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.109
 let's solve it since we are 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.939
 to see here clear colors is 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.500
 accustomed to another color code and 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.510
 those things well then at the beginning then 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.489
 may confuse a little but not but 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.370
 It's very cool and it turns very well you see the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.170
 ll here as the face you are not in the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.780
 pink face this is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.780
 pink rose is worth this I think it does well 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.040
 if you see now a grape this always gives you 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 VPN east cube has all 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.390
 pellets l just like the other names 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.900
 that has them 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.660
 20m fer and good e learning this as 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.750
 crazy and not much more to say a 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 rubik's cube 3 x 3 but basically 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.730
 very beautiful pretty has its weight is very 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.890
 cool the center is pretty big the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.380
 stickers are also cool because 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.480
 they have the shape of the exact piece is not 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.459
 very correct everything very nice everything but 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.070
 that is not more, it is neither more nor less than 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.160
 a three by three so basically from 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.910
 aesthetically very nice collecting 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.040
 but it does not have any nothing 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.830
 special compared to any cube of 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.630
 rubik three by three in batches this to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.340
 compete I suppose it would be worth 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.340
 because to see 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.630
 I do not know, I think it's still worth it 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.550
 well maybe not because it's a bit 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.530
 domed is a bit domed if we 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.080
 we fix is not straight straight is not 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.270
 totally flat then maybe to be 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.340
 a dome do not let us compete 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.170
 with him but if it was totally 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.780
 square I do not think there was a problem 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.120
 because even if the pieces are not not 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.550
 all proportionally equal not that 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.500
 it has nothing to do the edges have 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.970
 one way the centers also have a 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.560
 very big way but I think I do not know 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.780
 can compete with is because it's a bit 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.790
 bulging and being dome well 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.650
 that already disable as to compete 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.090
 but well I do not roll up more because 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.890
 is not much more to say about a 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.020
 three times three is not pretty as we have 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.850
 seen that it's nice because it's already so 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.170
 nothing, thank you very much for your crisis' 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.470
 of your subscriptions and see you in 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.470
 other
