when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.000> one<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.300> interesting<00:01:00.450> thing

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
when you one really interesting thing

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.320 
when you one really interesting thing
about<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.260> silver<00:01:01.650> clouds<00:01:01.860> is<00:01:02.190> every<00:01:03.090> one<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
about the silver clouds is every one you

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.390 
about the silver clouds is every one you
get<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> push<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.589> brake<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
get into you push the brake down and it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
get into you push the brake down and it
is<00:01:05.549> rock<00:01:05.909> hard<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.420> may<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.750> different<00:01:07.229> levels

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is rock hard it may be different levels

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.800 
is rock hard it may be different levels
you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.640> according<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> adjustments<00:01:09.689> but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you know according to adjustments but

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.649 
you know according to adjustments but
it's<00:01:09.990> rock<00:01:10.320> art<00:01:10.590> always<00:01:11.090> that's<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.540> even

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's rock art always that's because even

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's rock art always that's because even
if<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:12.960> master<00:01:13.140> cylinders<00:01:13.620> are<00:01:13.770> totally<00:01:14.130> dry

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
if your master cylinders are totally dry

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
if your master cylinders are totally dry
and<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.690> they're<00:01:15.870> not<00:01:16.020> attached

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and that's because they're not attached

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
and that's because they're not attached
the<00:01:17.340> brake<00:01:17.520> pedals<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.909> attached<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the brake pedals not attached to the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.920 
the brake pedals not attached to the
master<00:01:18.840> cylinders<00:01:19.260> it's<00:01:20.040> attached<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
master cylinders it's attached to the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
master cylinders it's attached to the
servo<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.890> rear<00:01:23.370> brakes<00:01:23.670> there's<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
servo and then the rear brakes there's a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.160 
servo and then the rear brakes there's a
little<00:01:25.610> expander<00:01:26.610> back<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.870> anyways

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
little expander back there so anyways

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.500 
little expander back there so anyways
the<00:01:28.290> brake<00:01:28.500> servo<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.010> you<00:01:29.100> put<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> foot<00:01:30.390> on

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the brake servo when you put the foot on

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.300 
the brake servo when you put the foot on
the<00:01:30.630> brake<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.170> car<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.500> moving<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the brake and the car is moving this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.140 
the brake and the car is moving this
this<00:01:32.700> brake<00:01:33.479> servo<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:35.400> clutch<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
this brake servo is a clutch and it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.980 
this brake servo is a clutch and it
grabs<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.260> that<00:01:38.100> motion<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.630> grabbing

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
grabs and that motion that grabbing

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
grabs and that motion that grabbing
motion<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.979> pushes<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.490> hydraulics

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
motion is what pushes your hydraulics

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.000 
motion is what pushes your hydraulics
pushes<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> master<00:01:43.350> cylinders<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
pushes the master cylinders and that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.469 
pushes the master cylinders and that
sends<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> fluid<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> wheels<00:01:45.150> and

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
sends the fluid to the wheels and

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.920 
sends the fluid to the wheels and

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
expanse of brake shoes themselves it's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
expanse of brake shoes themselves it's
archaic<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.229> way<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.159> used<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
archaic in a way because they used it I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.820 
archaic in a way because they used it I
think<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> early<00:01:54.570> 20s<00:01:55.260> and<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.650> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
think back to the early 20s and all the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.789 
think back to the early 20s and all the
Rolls<00:01:56.010> Royces<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.729> had<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.200> servo<00:01:58.200> assist

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Rolls Royces they had a servo assist

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.420 
Rolls Royces they had a servo assist
even<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> purely<00:02:00.060> mechanical<00:02:00.210> brakes<00:02:01.430> today

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
even the purely mechanical brakes today

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.030 
even the purely mechanical brakes today
we're<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.850> cover<00:02:03.090> some<00:02:03.510> basic

how the clutch or the the brake servo
how<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.110> change<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.530> lining<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:16.980> that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
how you can change the lining on that

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.870 
how you can change the lining on that
and<00:02:18.450> how<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:18.959> operates<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> show<00:02:20.819> you
