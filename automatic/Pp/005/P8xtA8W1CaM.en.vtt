 over 30 million tenge for this workshop 32 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.299
 years this is a technical complex 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.070
 maintenance workshop reconstructs and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.860
 updates in two and a half months 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.659
 it is being upgraded 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 production base also conditions

 signed contract since 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 increase fare fare conditions 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.610
 the carrier has fulfilled the memorandum only 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.440
 70 percent which items are met 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.930
 rolling stock renewal 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.450
 there you see means

 technological equipment update 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.890
 gradually means 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.610
 working clothes we are preparing for not yet 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.570
 fulfilled 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.570
 mean wage increase we 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.690
 yet we can not afford due to the fact 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.340
 that funds are still insufficient 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.800
 the question remains of increasing 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.780
 service culture complaints of rudeness 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.910

 about six million passenger 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.770
 month well naturally discontent and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.660
 will and on the one hand on the other hand 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.050
 we work in this plan we have 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 except that there is a tax authority 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.489
 hotline we have our own hot 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.730
 that is, for each call passengers 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.270
 Complaint means compulsory peace and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.210
 measures are being taken 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 always not in favor of our anzud meanwhile 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.660
 to fulfill all obligations and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.750
 provide passengers with quality 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.820
 services need money tariff 57th 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.040
 according to carriers do not cover 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.440
 enterprise expenses meanwhile in akimat 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.450
 Karaganda created a commission from among the anti 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 monopolists tax deputies and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.800
 social activists for review 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.770
 cost of the tariff at the decision of the commission 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.610
 we will consider the question further either 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.800
 tariff increase or subsidy 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.310
 auto enterprises but this is not a fact that can 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.680
 rate 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.190
 Tenge variety exists can eat 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.680
 really 75-80 money but still 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.810
 results not announced plans have 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.510
 big automakers next year 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.910
 for example Temirtau 3 fleet plans 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.190
 equip buses with gps navigators 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.180
