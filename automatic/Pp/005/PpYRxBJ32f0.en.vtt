00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 puppies all big big hello it 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.799
 leads so in my iphone 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.020
 and in this video you can't 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 see me because i just 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.240
 my head is out of the shower i'm wet 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 bathrobe and because of this I decided in this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 video only shoot on the back of the camera and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 shows only your phone and also 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 I tell you in advance what I am in no way 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
 case don't brag about my phone I'm 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 I shoot this video is not from what I wanted 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.359
 boast a from the fact that he's crazy 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
 a huge number of people therefore me 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 remove this video so please do not 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 think that I shoot this video because 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.420
 wanted to brag and not write me in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.940
 comments that I am waiting for you and my 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160
 telephone, let's finally start 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.610
 let's start with the fact that my phone 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 iphone 5 to 16 gigabytes and as you see 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.329
 white to me and you bought yesterday and on 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.660
 it already has such a bumper here 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.090
 blue the best regular bumper i 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 I think that about the appearance of the iPhone itself 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 it makes no sense to tell because I 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 I think that many already know how he is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 looks and already many have it so i 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.540
 now put your phone course on 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.189
 a mountain of books since I will be with you now 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 tell and show their position 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.140
 which I have there I want you 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.380
 it was all better visible so let's 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.900
 finally turn my phone on so we 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 turned on my phone and on screen 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.930
 I have such locks here 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.400
 of these little nice millionaires 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.520

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.829

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 percent charge remaining as well as in 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.409
 I am an operator and how many stripes I have 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.450
 most need of course 2 pages too 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.790
 pretty need all sorts of programs so 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 I use it but on the first pages 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.450
 all the most necessary position which 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.550
 I use it always and always 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.750
 need very very very 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.360
 often and this is a camera calendar clock about 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 side of the building, that is, standard 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.570
 provisions that were already originally 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 downloaded on iphone 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.790
 further music lover who does not know it 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.300
 the application in which you can download 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.510

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.710

 maps and yandex maps and yandex because 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.700
 apple cards which again 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.010
 I was not initially downloaded 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.140
 rejoice though not too good but all 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.280
 still seems to me that the Yandex map when 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.350
 it's easier for me as well 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 like further books 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.310
 I have only one book here so far 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 this is harry potter and the deathly hallows and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.900
 concluded yesterday and got caught seems to me 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.110
 that I would hardly read it because 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.570
 I do not really like something like a mountain and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.060
 Well, maybe of course I will 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.380
 read more here such zakladochka 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.520
 book catalog she called it 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.080
 click on this bookmark here 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.840
 This is the site that opens 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:27.180
 which is called apple 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:30.620
 books.ru there are a lot of books 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.570
 which can be downloaded on in ibooks and 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 there are so many books in Russian that 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.400
 I really like it here because buy 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.110
 here in the say books shop here in my 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.660
 In general, there is not a single book in Russian 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.239
 so I really don't like it very much 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.640
 the fact that there is not a single book in Russian well 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.670
 Of course, who likes a reader there ? 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.590

 I like this store books 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:09.090
 Further applications which is called 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:13.320
 growth that is this application in which 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.440

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.900
 it says here for example

 find my phone is apple iphone 5 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.970
 16 gigabyte white 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.430
 It is in the apple store that it stands 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.699

 sale search here news shops 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:50.380
 the basket well, I mean, I’m pretty 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.080
 it seems an interesting position is not that 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.259
 just interesting to me personally it seems to be 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.979
 need then viber who does not know it 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:04.690
 an application which is just the way for 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:08.849
 iphone wildebeest you can chat for free 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:13.020
 absolutely that is to write messages and 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:16.630
 Now she calls me quite like 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:19.650
 then one slide is a translator too 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.669
 really need someone else then this 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.680
 the program that defines these here 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:31.320
 square icons then flashlight 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.729
 completely ordinary flashlight 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:43.810
 Here, too, if you need someone like that 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:49.000
 fan turn on so here well in general here 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.979
 such a situation is also very necessary because 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.750
 what is very convenient is what is there 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.199
 the position of the cat can be pressed and there immediately 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.940
 lights turn on here because if not 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.240
 will be such a situation but need 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:07.050
 flashlight will not have to go into the camera 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:11.380
 then here now turn on the flash in general 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.240
 flashlight is very long and uncomfortable so 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.880
 how easy it is to unlock immediately 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.460
 press the flashlight will be all okay so here 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.270
 here is the most necessary below 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.190
 four 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:26.050
 Appendix 1 is a phone, I think it is not necessary 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.000
 him as a detailed story because 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.830
 completely ordinary phone because such 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.930
 daddy called message 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.389
 here is the usual message and here is the chain 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.630
 again ski who does not know what is here 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.950
 chain really think 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.130
 but such people who do not know what is 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.480
 this is the same as viber only 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.340
 here you can not call and this application 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.550
 it costs 1 dollar aweber 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.300
 free further safari in principle 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.700
 the Internet 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:57.170
 I think everyone knows it and not necessarily 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.300
 I need further instagram think too 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.100
 Many people know what someone instagram 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.170
 I wonder who else is not subscribed to me 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.170
 my name is there like this allochka is sweet and
