00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:13.100
 for a group is already made 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.140
 a little bit but we are already 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.789
 coming to our section homemade tips 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.350
 where are we going to talk about how are we going to 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.630
 clean the kitchen burners not 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.119
 well in the kitchen burners good 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.189
 of the stove cleaning it is mufa sometimes 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.429
 is there one of the jobs that least we 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.650
 He likes to do in the house Fat 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.930
 cochambre are things we really 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.880
 They stress a lot but do not worry 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.949
 because I'm going to tell you some tips 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.230
 So do not fight so much do not suffer so much 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:44.149
 this detail and size and size and that nothing 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.280
 well, it was not in our father but 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.230
 there is an exercise if you have to do it 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.039
 frank so you do not like to clean yourself 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.679
 you have to learn faster 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.239
 listen there are many cleaners there 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.769
 obviously they sell in the super and everything 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.510
 but if you want to use the 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.519
 products that you already have in your home can 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.440
 do it for example what you can do 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.630
 to clean the burners not from the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.579
 stove have to be obviously stove 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.560
 of gas because the electric stoves that 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.020
 you can not can not be removed 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.509
 then it takes away from us and what it does dilutes 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.820
 juice of one lemon in hot water to them 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.430
 It is hot water with the juice of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.490
 lemon and then italy with any 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 detergent soap rinses the same and is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 faster than fat is going the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 lemon cut the lemon cut the fat but 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.470
 if you do not want to do that what also 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.329
 can do is with baking soda 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.829
 it's a great time precisely to leave the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.600
 burners towards the stove not obviously 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.429
 here is everything has to be turned off 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.140
 disconnected by anything as you go 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.690
 to walk there moving to the stove 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.909
 then put the burners on them 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.759
 a thick layer of baking soda 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.520
 make sure it is very thick and then 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.060
 leave for a while that is not moistens 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.929
 as it can be with water or with vinegar 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.429
 then the vinegar is a pearl 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.560
 verdinegra is a wonder of truth 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.990
 what you have to have but liters of vinegar 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.520
 in the house because it's good for everyone 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.979
 the solvent weights and not in the area of 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.349
 cleaning is used to clean for the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.989
 it costs in the end then you can spray with 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.250
 water with vinegar after carvings equal 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.040
 with soap 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.000
 and it's what you have, not soap 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.210
 frets 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.940
 the detergent sizes and go faster 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.030
 all that fat the metal carvers 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.710
 that there are good no but obviously I 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.510
 I always recommend they already know the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.100
 real to do everything with gloves not 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.230
 sorry for the burners and the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.440
 burners as is a material let's say 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.540
 more resistant not for the stove if the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.630
 line even though I'm going to confess that I 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.120
 I was if I clean it with these are 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.880
 short when your metal is so 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.430
 with them with those a size dita is not 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.370
 fast it cleans up to the best they remain light 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.030
 nine streaks, but I say 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 you take it as if it were painting 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 because I stove but I have 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.950
 electrical then if there are that birds 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.080
 burst and so I but nothing more there 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.780
 they were easier to clean with 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.790
 water and with the soap behind hey and how 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.620
 good is since we're in that I'm going to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 put my mother who put aluminum to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.130
 use this you can also make it from 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.590
 actually weave the products 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.440
 special for 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.910
 lining up fasters not fasting 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.470
 special products or aluminum what 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.360
 which is that aluminum is cheaper 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.519
 then at the time of changing them 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.870
 Well, you are not spending so much, but yes, 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.099
 they can also do it a lot for 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.989
 that they do not get so dirty 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.430
 burners that is really if what 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.629

 does this is that here in the df and 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.190

 there is no gas in the oven anymore and everything is 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.980
 electrical so they are changing the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.810
 customs but look but almost not the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.390
