00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 maybe the file do not fuck it no mamen 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.250
 How friends are we here as crumbs 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.510
 black like these the next day I'm 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.179
 in exponent 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.420
 I like music a lot 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.420
 anime conventions I really like 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 it's a little about that we know all 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.860
 that you are very smart animating in flash and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 mega's character has become 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.510
 emblematic for all followers 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.470
 aside you collaborate with the doctor goku 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.970
 tell us a little about your career 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.160
 as an animator 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.739
 Well, I really are not animator 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.850
 I'm a monero, I did not study animation and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.649
 a miner who gives him or be put 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.320
 seems to be encouraged but with three 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.660
 animation as such and let's start 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 as a hobby you start drawing and then you 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.140
 learn and flash with a compass 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 the full body 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 and we started doing a series 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.230
 after the crow came out as a 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.020
 joke 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.870
 in a chapter another series we said things 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.760
 what to do and that ox and so I am a famous 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.230
 and then I'm worse, and it's like 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.880
 from there 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.890
 we started going to conventions and then already 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.200
 we keep looking for the bad with doctor 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.530
 eye is that as it is something of akira 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.990
 toriyama oscar po is not legal so 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.880
 they sue you because when you nurse but not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.460
 you can profit from that you can not 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.010
 take as today but up there because of that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.750
 the characters that are not 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.370
 invents like the legal about the checker or 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.720
 how did all this start today and then this one 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.160
 it started as a hobby I started 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.190
 doing some animation that are called 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.270
 tuna or the dotcom mouse was not in 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.869
 flash I was not on youtube 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.759
 and I started that there is always guaguas 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.210
 in animation in other matters 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:02.009
 so it's not going to do anything was a year 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.009
 of 5 minutes and then rest a year 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.950
 rest the school and then do it 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.500
 vÃ­car another and a fuck and that nothing 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.989
 mames four years and then the two 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.870
 started to be shorter to beat him 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.290
 practice and it supports another I keep doing 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.329
 short because it comes out faster and the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.819
 Hard motivation because if they last long 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.209
 it gives you egg and I do not know anything as a 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.890
 episode of denying something this well not 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.329
 occurrences of what you see makes a mom 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.360
 towards that they are for example when there 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.150
 marvel with the capcom and you make a parody 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.550
 of that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.260
 for example the geeks was in me too 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.650
 the geek 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.110
 and if I would not be here but not if they are 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.030
 pure occurrences and algae getting 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.030
 assholes with this with something
