kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.220> almost<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> ratcheting

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
kind of like almost like a ratcheting

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.869 
kind of like almost like a ratcheting
system<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> deep<00:02:10.259> end<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.310> exactly

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
system on the deep end and it's exactly

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.300 
system on the deep end and it's exactly
what<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
what it is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.440 
what it is
it's<00:02:14.310> kind<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.579> fun<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.819> describe<00:02:15.329> because

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it's kind of fun to describe because

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.929 
it's kind of fun to describe because
it's<00:02:15.719> very<00:02:16.019> smooth<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.189> mean<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.459> runs<00:02:17.760> on

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
it's very smooth I mean it's runs on

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.059 
it's very smooth I mean it's runs on
bearings<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.810> ridiculously<00:02:19.439> small<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.920> can

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
bearings it's ridiculously small you can

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.160 
bearings it's ridiculously small you can
see<00:02:20.310> how<00:02:20.909> quick<00:02:21.299> help<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.689> know<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
see how quick help you know that the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.729 
see how quick help you know that the
deployment<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.829> speed<00:02:23.129> but<00:02:23.879> it's<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
deployment of speed but it's it's that

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.220 
deployment of speed but it's it's that
sound<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:27.450> feedback<00:02:27.989> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
sound and that that feedback the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.649 
sound and that that feedback the
physical<00:02:29.040> feedback<00:02:29.219> when<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.150> move<00:02:30.329> when<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
physical feedback when you move when you

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.559 
physical feedback when you move when you
close<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.900> has<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.799> Ross<00:02:32.129> that<00:02:32.819> little<00:02:33.120> ceramic

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
close it has it Ross that little ceramic

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.869 
close it has it Ross that little ceramic
ball<00:02:33.989> as<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.379> draws<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.159> on<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.549> little

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
ball as it draws on the on the little

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.929 
ball as it draws on the on the little
crater<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.689> steel<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.920> really<00:02:38.370> cool<00:02:38.549> and

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
crater so the steel it's really cool and

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.970 
crater so the steel it's really cool and
I<00:02:39.599> imagine<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.109> gonna<00:02:40.290> wear<00:02:40.469> out<00:02:40.680> because

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
I imagine it's gonna wear out because

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.649 
I imagine it's gonna wear out because
the<00:02:41.069> ceramic<00:02:41.489> will<00:02:41.639> probably<00:02:41.969> wear<00:02:42.120> outs<00:02:42.329> nice

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
the ceramic will probably wear outs nice

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.479 
the ceramic will probably wear outs nice
little<00:02:43.019> groove<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.650> pathway<00:02:44.129> where<00:02:44.340> it's

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
little groove the pathway where it's

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.589 
little groove the pathway where it's
going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.819> riding<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
going to be riding on just like the

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.089 
going to be riding on just like the
bearings<00:02:48.599> will<00:02:48.870> wear<00:02:49.139> out<00:02:49.169> the<00:02:49.560> nice<00:02:49.739> little

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
bearings will wear out the nice little

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.490 
bearings will wear out the nice little
silica<00:02:50.819> groove<00:02:51.090> around<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.049> know<00:02:52.169> where<00:02:52.379> they

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
silica groove around you know where they

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000 
silica groove around you know where they
where<00:02:52.829> they<00:02:52.980> sit<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.549> nest<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:55.010> it's

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
where they sit with the nest but it's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.030 
where they sit with the nest but it's
really<00:02:56.310> interesting<00:02:56.760> feeling<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.859> nice

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
really interesting feeling and it's nice

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.339 
really interesting feeling and it's nice
that<00:02:59.069> it's<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.639> smooth<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.239> flies<00:03:00.810> open<00:03:01.019> so

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
that it's so smooth it flies open so

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.319 
that it's so smooth it flies open so
quick<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.489> know<00:03:02.579> when<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.819> close<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
quick but you know when you close it it

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.490 
quick but you know when you close it it
doesn't<00:03:03.480> want<00:03:03.719> to<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.930> fall<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.290> your

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
doesn't want to just fall on your

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.470 
doesn't want to just fall on your
fingers<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:04.919> chop<00:03:05.189> your<00:03:05.310> fingers<00:03:05.669> off<00:03:05.819> not<00:03:06.329> to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
fingers and chop your fingers off not to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.759 
fingers and chop your fingers off not to
mention<00:03:06.719> it<00:03:06.840> slide<00:03:07.079> but<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.620> know<00:03:07.680> how

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
mention it slide but you know how

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.069 
mention it slide but you know how
sometimes<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.549> like<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.689> smoothness<00:03:10.019> of

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
sometimes I like the smoothness of

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.599 
sometimes I like the smoothness of
knives<00:03:10.469> but<00:03:10.620> sometimes<00:03:11.010> it's<00:03:11.189> kind<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> like

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
knives but sometimes it's kind of like

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.580 
knives but sometimes it's kind of like
weird<00:03:11.969> that<00:03:12.599> why<00:03:12.780> would<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.079> want<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.409> have<00:03:13.560> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
weird that why would you want to have a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.990 
weird that why would you want to have a
knife<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.669> it<00:03:14.879> just

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
knife that when you do this it just

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.729 
knife that when you do this it just
starts<00:03:15.540> automatically<00:03:16.049> falling<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.620> your

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
starts automatically falling on your

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.710 
starts automatically falling on your
fingers<00:03:17.129> and<00:03:17.310> if<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.970> knife<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.269> sharp<00:03:18.299> edge

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
fingers and if the knife is sharp edge

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.479 
fingers and if the knife is sharp edge
is<00:03:18.840> supposed<00:03:19.139> to<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.889> actually<00:03:20.040> catch<00:03:20.370> you

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
is supposed to it can actually catch you

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.460 
is supposed to it can actually catch you
very<00:03:20.699> easy<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.900> still<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.260> kind<00:03:22.379> of

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
very easy but it's still it's kind of

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.809 
very easy but it's still it's kind of
fun<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:23.040> something<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.549> always

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
fun because it's something that I always

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.610 
fun because it's something that I always
try<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.449> anyway<00:03:24.810> even<00:03:25.199> though<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.500> think

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
try to do anyway even though I think

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.280 
try to do anyway even though I think
it's<00:03:25.919> weird<00:03:26.099> but<00:03:26.819> it's<00:03:26.879> good<00:03:27.659> i<00:03:27.810> guess<00:03:28.109> it's

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
it's weird but it's good i guess it's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.809 
it's weird but it's good i guess it's
that<00:03:28.439> kind<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> night<00:03:28.799> making<00:03:29.129> accomplishment

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
that kind of night making accomplishment

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.429 
that kind of night making accomplishment
to<00:03:29.909> make<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.239> as<00:03:30.359> smooth<00:03:30.629> as<00:03:30.750> possible<00:03:30.810> even

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
to make it as smooth as possible even

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.270 
to make it as smooth as possible even
though<00:03:32.220> i<00:03:32.250> I'm<00:03:32.609> not<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.879> biggest<00:03:33.060> fan<00:03:33.239> of<00:03:33.389> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
though i I'm not the biggest fan of it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.270 
though i I'm not the biggest fan of it
but<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.519> came<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.299> nice<00:03:36.479> this<00:03:37.290> side<00:03:37.530> also<00:03:37.769> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
but it came out nice this side also it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.629 
but it came out nice this side also it
has<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.639> kinda<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:40.620> almost<00:03:40.799> invisible

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
has it kinda like it's almost invisible

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.460 
has it kinda like it's almost invisible
that<00:03:41.790> rock<00:03:42.030> part<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.419> really<00:03:42.689> that's<00:03:43.079> more

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
that rock part is really that's more

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.140 
that rock part is really that's more
than<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.859> counter<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.459> literally<00:03:44.879> just

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
than that counter is literally just

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.270 
than that counter is literally just
contouring<00:03:45.689> done<00:03:46.259> by<00:03:46.500> rock<00:03:46.739> pattern<00:03:46.949> you<00:03:47.220> can

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
contouring done by rock pattern you can

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.270 
contouring done by rock pattern you can
see<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.699> really<00:03:47.909> nice<00:03:48.239> shaping<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.739> need

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
see that really nice shaping and I need

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.670 
see that really nice shaping and I need
three<00:03:50.609> nice<00:03:50.909> color<00:03:51.269> on<00:03:51.389> this<00:03:51.629> so<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.259> was<00:03:52.439> nice

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
three nice color on this so it was nice

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.159 
three nice color on this so it was nice
and<00:03:52.739> blue<00:03:53.250> there<00:03:53.909> was<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> lot<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.389> some<00:03:54.750> washing

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
and blue there was a lot of some washing

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.259 
and blue there was a lot of some washing
and<00:03:55.349> then<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.560> went<00:03:55.739> back<00:03:55.859> for<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.370> for<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and then we went back for the for the

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.719 
and then we went back for the for the
bronzes<00:03:57.900> orangish<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.189> there's<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.489> very

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
bronzes orangish so there's a very

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.990 
bronzes orangish so there's a very
similar<00:04:00.239> color<00:04:00.509> scheme<00:04:00.930> color<00:04:01.650> team<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.849> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
similar color scheme color team to the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240 
similar color scheme color team to the
time<00:04:03.209> ascus<00:04:03.659> except<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.379> pattern<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:04.979> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
time ascus except the pattern but the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.420 
time ascus except the pattern but the
colors<00:04:05.639> are<00:04:05.790> pretty<00:04:06.150> similar<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.129> I<00:04:08.129> think<00:04:08.340> it

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
colors are pretty similar and I think it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.189 
colors are pretty similar and I think it
just<00:04:08.459> works<00:04:08.819> together<00:04:08.970> well<00:04:09.329> blue<00:04:09.840> titanium

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
just works together well blue titanium

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.469 
just works together well blue titanium
screws<00:04:12.470> nested<00:04:13.470> nicely<00:04:13.979> in<00:04:14.069> their<00:04:14.479> pocket

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
screws nested nicely in their pocket

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.949 
screws nested nicely in their pocket
clip<00:04:15.629> works<00:04:15.930> great<00:04:16.409> cool<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:18.389> lag

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
clip works great cool little the lag

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.620 
clip works great cool little the lag
relief<00:04:19.349> is<00:04:19.680> looks<00:04:20.220> pretty<00:04:20.549> nice<00:04:20.759> it<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.419> that

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
relief is looks pretty nice it is that

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.529 
relief is looks pretty nice it is that
it's<00:04:22.019> three<00:04:22.680> groups<00:04:22.919> here<00:04:23.099> three<00:04:23.400> grooves<00:04:23.669> the

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
it's three groups here three grooves the

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.120 
it's three groups here three grooves the
flipper<00:04:24.870> had<00:04:24.990> four

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
flipper had four

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.630 
flipper had four
very<00:04:27.090> disengaged<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.290> actually<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:29.130> little

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
very disengaged is actually a little

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.000 
very disengaged is actually a little
earlier<00:04:30.120> lockup<00:04:30.630> than<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.930> like<00:04:31.200> but<00:04:31.860> it's

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
earlier lockup than I like but it's

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.740 
earlier lockup than I like but it's
still<00:04:32.220> nice<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.520> solid<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.240> imagine<00:04:33.630> it's

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
still nice and solid and I imagine it's

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.600 
still nice and solid and I imagine it's
gonna<00:04:33.930> wear<00:04:34.140> out<00:04:34.320> nice<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.800> probably<00:04:35.190> by<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
gonna wear out nice and probably by the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.450 
gonna wear out nice and probably by the
time<00:04:35.820> i<00:04:36.030> will<00:04:36.330> actually<00:04:36.840> send<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.530> 20<00:04:38.070> lay

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
time i will actually send it to 20 lay

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.950 
time i will actually send it to 20 lay
