I'm just going to stamp the treacle and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.150 
I'm just going to stamp the treacle and
pecan<00:00:21.090> granola<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:22.230> instead<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.560> having<00:00:22.769> milk

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
pecan granola but instead of having milk

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.580 
pecan granola but instead of having milk
in<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.430> I've<00:00:23.699> bought<00:00:24.060> some<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.590> activity

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
in it I've bought some of the activity

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.439 
in it I've bought some of the activity
pouring<00:00:25.949> you're<00:00:26.099> good<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> girl<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:29.449> 196

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
pouring you're good and the girl has 196

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.950 
pouring you're good and the girl has 196
calories<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.340> yogurt<00:00:32.850> has<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.390> 87

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
calories in and the yogurt has just 87

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
calories in and the yogurt has just 87
calories<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> amount<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.579> that's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
calories in amount so I think that's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.810 
calories in amount so I think that's
really<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.920> granola<00:00:38.190> Anyang<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> used

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
really good and granola Anyang it used

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.020 
really good and granola Anyang it used
to<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.210> favorite<00:00:39.690> things<00:00:40.500> um<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to be one of my favorite things um so it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.779 
to be one of my favorite things um so it
feels<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> treat<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.610> know<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
feels like a bit of a treat I know it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.410

doesn't<00:00:44.940> look<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.899> appetizing<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:48.149> only

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.120 
I was a bit disappointed when I took my
measurements<00:03:06.220> because<00:03:06.660> obviously<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.930> do<00:03:08.590> feel

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
measurements because obviously I do feel

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.690

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
lighter I feel like I can tell when if I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.910 
lighter I feel like I can tell when if I
step<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.210> scales<00:03:13.510> I'm<00:03:13.900> gonna<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.710> lost

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
I really don't understand how losing a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.840 
I really don't understand how losing a
pound<00:03:28.630> doesn't<00:03:28.990> mean<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.320> lose<00:03:29.920> like<00:03:30.160> some

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
pound doesn't mean that I lose like some

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.050 
pound doesn't mean that I lose like some
weight<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:32.170> measurements<00:03:32.530> even<00:03:32.590> uhm<00:03:33.060> so

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
weight some measurements even uhm so

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.530 
weight some measurements even uhm so
yeah<00:03:34.090> um<00:03:34.960> obviously<00:03:35.890> last<00:03:36.280> week<00:03:36.790> I<00:03:37.150> had<00:03:37.510> my

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
yeah um obviously last week I had my

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.230 
yeah um obviously last week I had my
Halloween<00:03:38.440> party<00:03:38.470> which<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.640> think<00:03:39.970> there

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
Halloween party which I think there

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.090 
Halloween party which I think there
might<00:03:40.390> be<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.570> video<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:41.020> um<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.900> I'm

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
might be a video of um so when I'm

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.380 
might be a video of um so when I'm
weighed<00:03:45.100> myself<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> middle<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.180> last

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
weighed myself in the middle of last

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.000 
weighed myself in the middle of last
week<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.660> think<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.990> was<00:03:47.140> on<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.290> Wednesday<00:03:47.470> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
week I think it was on the Wednesday I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.050 
week I think it was on the Wednesday I
had<00:03:48.580> lost<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.750> pound<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.830> then<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.070> was<00:03:51.430> 12<00:03:51.790> stone

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.050 
had lost a pound so then I was 12 stone
8<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:53.680> because<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:53.980> my<00:03:54.100> party<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.490> put<00:03:54.880> on

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
8 but then because of my party I put on

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.630 
8 but then because of my party I put on
a<00:03:55.090> pound<00:03:55.510> which<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.890> wasn't<00:03:57.160> very<00:03:57.370> happy<00:03:57.490> about

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
a pound which I wasn't very happy about

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.280 
a pound which I wasn't very happy about

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
is ok so like it's not the end of the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.540 
is ok so like it's not the end of the
world<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.570> slip<00:04:22.780> up<00:04:22.930> like<00:04:23.260> I've<00:04:24.190> still

I shouldn't have like I've had I had
like<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:44.980> slice<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.430> cake<00:04:45.550> when<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:45.850> shouldn't

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
like a slice of cake when I shouldn't

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.560 
like a slice of cake when I shouldn't
have<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.570> some<00:04:47.320> biscuits<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.270> when<00:04:49.270> I've<00:04:49.390> had

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
have and some biscuits and when I've had

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.540

like<00:04:49.750> rice<00:04:50.020> with<00:04:50.440> meals<00:04:50.740> like<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.220> had<00:04:51.370> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
like rice with meals like I had the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.700 
like rice with meals like I had the
mushroom<00:04:51.910> stroganoff<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.570> I<00:04:53.380> added<00:04:53.560> some

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
mushroom stroganoff and I added some

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.380 
mushroom stroganoff and I added some
rice<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.280> it<00:04:54.310> because<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.760> don't<00:04:55.000> think<00:04:55.210> that

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
rice to it because I don't think that

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.960 
rice to it because I don't think that
it's<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:55.870> bulky<00:04:56.140> enough<00:04:56.670> when<00:04:57.670> I<00:04:57.700> would

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
it's it's bulky enough when I would

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.580 
it's it's bulky enough when I would
normally<00:04:58.150> have<00:04:58.480> had<00:04:58.660> some<00:04:58.900> vegetables<00:04:59.530> with

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
normally have had some vegetables with

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.420 
normally have had some vegetables with
it<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:00.400> didn't<00:05:01.360> have<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.570> calories<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.430> but

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
it I didn't have the calories for it but

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.450 
it I didn't have the calories for it but
the<00:05:03.820> good<00:05:04.030> thing<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.810> guess<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.800> when<00:05:06.430> I

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
the good thing is I guess that when I

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.000 
the good thing is I guess that when I
cheat<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.480> have<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.720> few<00:05:08.020> snacks<00:05:08.290> or<00:05:08.620> add<00:05:08.830> some

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
cheat and have a few snacks or add some

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.220 
cheat and have a few snacks or add some
extra<00:05:09.310> rice<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.880> know<00:05:10.330> I'm<00:05:10.960> doing<00:05:11.200> something

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
extra rice I know I'm doing something

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.040 
extra rice I know I'm doing something
bad<00:05:11.710> like<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.580> know<00:05:13.120> I<00:05:13.150> shouldn't<00:05:13.540> be<00:05:13.600> doing<00:05:13.780> it

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
bad like I know I shouldn't be doing it

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.360 
bad like I know I shouldn't be doing it
whereas<00:05:14.260> in<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.560> past<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.950> think<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.190> would<00:05:15.310> you

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
whereas in the past I think I would you

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.960 
whereas in the past I think I would you
try<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> justify<00:05:16.060> it<00:05:16.240> like

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
try to justify it like

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.970 
try to justify it like
it's<00:05:17.390> okay<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:17.780> can<00:05:18.140> have<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.710> won't<00:05:18.860> make

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
it's okay I can have this it won't make

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.950 
it's okay I can have this it won't make
any<00:05:19.040> difference<00:05:19.220> when<00:05:19.670> I<00:05:19.700> know<00:05:20.090> on<00:05:20.420> diet<00:05:20.660> chef

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
any difference when I know on diet chef

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.300 
any difference when I know on diet chef
that<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.710> might<00:05:22.070> make<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.280> difference<00:05:22.420> so<00:05:23.420> I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
that it might make a difference so I

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.890 
that it might make a difference so I
think<00:05:25.310> that's<00:05:25.670> good<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.330> shows<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.810> I'm

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
think that's good it shows that I'm

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.760 
think that's good it shows that I'm
learning<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.530> think<00:05:27.640> so<00:05:28.640> yeah<00:05:29.510> um

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
learning I think so yeah um
