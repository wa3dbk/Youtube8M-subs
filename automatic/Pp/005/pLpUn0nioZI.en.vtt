stomp
is<00:04:26.590> pretty<00:04:27.590> bad<00:04:27.800> because<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.280> stuns<00:04:28.550> your

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
is pretty bad because it stuns your

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.390 
is pretty bad because it stuns your
units<00:04:29.090> for<00:04:29.510> three<00:04:30.110> seconds<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.650> heroes<00:04:31.190> for

units for three seconds and heroes for

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.180 
units for three seconds and heroes for
two<00:04:31.550> but<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.600> doesn't<00:04:32.930> do<00:04:33.050> as<00:04:33.200> much<00:04:33.500> damage<00:04:33.530> as

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
two but it doesn't do as much damage as

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.670 
two but it doesn't do as much damage as
he'll<00:04:34.520> bear<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.630> actually<00:04:35.840> very<00:04:36.050> easy<00:04:36.470> to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
he'll bear so it's actually very easy to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.210

fast DPS them down with two waves of

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.450 
fast DPS them down with two waves of
trends<00:05:15.320> instead<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.770> had<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:16.040> tank<00:05:16.280> damage

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
trends instead you had to tank damage

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.670 
trends instead you had to tank damage
with<00:05:16.700> your<00:05:16.820> hero<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:17.540> with<00:05:17.720> this<00:05:17.840> build<00:05:18.140> at<00:05:18.320> the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
with your hero so with this build at the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.740 
with your hero so with this build at the
4-minute<00:05:19.250> mark<00:05:19.280> or<00:05:19.670> so<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:20.210> will<00:05:20.330> have<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.630> go

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
4-minute mark or so you will have to go

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.810 
4-minute mark or so you will have to go
back<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:21.050> heal<00:05:21.260> ideally<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.040> isn't<00:05:22.430> blocked

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
back to heal ideally this isn't blocked

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.180 
back to heal ideally this isn't blocked
so<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.420> can<00:05:23.720> use<00:05:23.960> your<00:05:24.140> trends<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.830> know<00:05:24.950> and

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
just clear this out but instead it's not

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.690 
just clear this out but instead it's not
too<00:05:28.850> big<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.090> deal<00:05:29.120> just<00:05:29.810> run<00:05:30.050> back<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.700> once

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
too big a deal just run back and once

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.520 
too big a deal just run back and once
you<00:05:31.850> run<00:05:32.060> back<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.480> know<00:05:32.570> heal<00:05:32.930> up<00:05:33.110> your<00:05:33.290> mana

you run back you know heal up your mana
and<00:05:33.770> while<00:05:34.370> you're<00:05:34.580> still<00:05:34.970> inside<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.750> base

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
and while you're still inside the base

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.310 
and while you're still inside the base
summons<00:05:36.920> some<00:05:37.130> trees<00:05:37.480> send<00:05:38.480> them<00:05:38.660> out<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.140> that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
summons some trees send them out so that

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.410 
summons some trees send them out so that
you<00:05:39.500> know<00:05:39.620> you're<00:05:39.860> you're<00:05:40.370> really<00:05:40.580> conserving

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420

your<00:05:41.540> mana<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:42.080> way<00:05:42.430> and<00:05:43.430> then<00:05:43.580> while

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
your mana this way and then while

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.460 
your mana this way and then while
they're<00:05:44.030> walking<00:05:44.240> out<00:05:44.540> keep<00:05:44.990> healing<00:05:45.350> your

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.340 
they're walking out keep healing your
mana<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:45.950> then<00:05:46.760> just<00:05:47.210> teleport<00:05:47.840> on<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.230> the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
mana and then just teleport on to the

mana and then just teleport on to the
neutral<00:05:48.680> camp<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.100> continue<00:05:49.940> because<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.990> the

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
neutral camp and continue because of the

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.470 
neutral camp and continue because of the
teleporter<00:05:51.620> skill<00:05:51.860> you're<00:05:52.370> not<00:05:52.580> really<00:05:52.880> you

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
teleporter skill you're not really you

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.300 
teleporter skill you're not really you
know<00:05:53.510> delaying<00:05:53.990> your<00:05:54.170> farm<00:05:54.470> time<00:05:54.710> by<00:05:54.920> too<00:05:54.980> much

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
know delaying your farm time by too much

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.610 
know delaying your farm time by too much
as<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.210> guys<00:05:56.360> saw<00:05:56.630> when<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:56.870> ran<00:05:57.110> back<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.530> was

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
as you guys saw when I ran back it was

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.950 
as you guys saw when I ran back it was
about<00:05:57.890> 4:30<00:05:58.550> you're<00:05:59.150> back<00:05:59.390> in<00:05:59.570> the<00:05:59.660> action

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
about 4:30 you're back in the action

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.010 
about 4:30 you're back in the action
about<00:06:00.170> 410<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.100> it's<00:06:01.400> about<00:06:01.610> 30<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.300> 40<00:06:02.600> seconds

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
about 410 so it's about 30 to 40 seconds

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.950 
about 410 so it's about 30 to 40 seconds
of<00:06:03.230> time<00:06:03.800> that<00:06:04.130> you're<00:06:04.280> spending<00:06:04.430> on<00:06:04.960> healing

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
of time that you're spending on healing

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.560 
of time that you're spending on healing
it's<00:06:06.440> not<00:06:06.890> too<00:06:07.130> bad<00:06:07.280> and<00:06:07.640> if<00:06:07.910> you<00:06:08.060> had<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.360> cur

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
it's not too bad and if you had to cur

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.930 
it's not too bad and if you had to cur
yourself<00:06:09.140> over<00:06:09.620> you<00:06:10.070> know<00:06:10.190> a<00:06:10.370> clarity<00:06:10.850> or

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
yourself over you know a clarity or

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.000 
yourself over you know a clarity or
something<00:06:11.270> like<00:06:11.390> that<00:06:11.450> it's<00:06:11.840> probably<00:06:12.080> not<00:06:12.620> as

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
something like that it's probably not as

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.770 
something like that it's probably not as
good<00:06:13.220> at<00:06:13.400> this<00:06:13.610> point<00:06:13.970> five<00:06:14.300> minutes<00:06:14.630> as<00:06:14.750> you
