00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.199
 looks to sign a new champion in almost 12 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 the house of my house here is agent to the 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.189
 merged risk 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.739
 so we in the video the 189th videos 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.050
 on the topic on youtube Brazil which is the 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.420
 such as the one who is nothing more than 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.760
 a recent support band that 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.489
 meet at the mall to play in the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.489
 Just to make a fool of it, probably 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.769
 the hangover of the demonstrations that 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.829
 we had in the past on the streets to give 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.149
 Yes, there is some social political 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.910
 kind of event 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.170
 I am against neither the fact of the mall 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.530
 centers on a private property 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.120
 when in fact it is the shopping mall 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.190
 hybrid establishment 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 it is a private property like this 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.020
 but open to the public 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.789
 or whoever enters completely 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.289
 different from my house which is a 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.539
 private property only enters who 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.450
 allow or completely different from the 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.670
 your home that is privately owned and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 who you allow then the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.209
 shopping center arguments one 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.250
 private property 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.200
 then you can not touch the area do not 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 It may not be there, that's okay. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.789
 the hole is below the problem of 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 our area making our touch in the area 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.200
 inside the mall is because it has 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.569
 many people involved in the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.959
 operation of the mall but with 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.170
 the employees that is cleaning 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.720
 safety 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.810
 the store sellers themselves 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.640
 tenants are paying rent for power 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.220
 have to trade them at the mall 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.259
 center not to mention the people who are 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.280
 at the mall strolling or eating 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.200
 something 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 not that I like mall by 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.720
 contrary to people who know me 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.970
 they personally know that I detested 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.510
 shopping center and believe it or not 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.000
 malls 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.430
 insurance for the middle class to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.230
 consumption without having any type of 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 near disturbance 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.030
 even so it does not make me comfortable 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.790
 with varzim if so-and-so, who did not 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.860
 shopping center have fun doing the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.960
 your shopping go shopping with your girlfriend 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
 walking the family parrot dog 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.320
 parakeet, whatever it is a right that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.030
 watch him 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.740
 preferably not disturbed 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 by the choice he made that it was 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 mall 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 while the first deals with people 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.790
 using the criterion of appearance 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.770
 suppose that these people will do 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.620
 part of a college inside the mall 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.110
 center is completely wrong 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.270
 once I spoke this very live the people 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.250
 here in Brazil is to define the other 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.080
 people very by appearance suddenly 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.210
 the shrimp at home and people 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.220
 think he's a great lawyer because he's 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.860
 a successful entrepreneur as in 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.280
 fact that he was a drug dealer or 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.650
 a pimp as a gun dealer 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.780
 to avoid this kind of embarrassment 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.950
 is much easier and is much more 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.900
 rational 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.030
 the superintendent of shopping mall 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 manager of the mall increase 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.830
 security by hiring more comrades 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 to make shopping safe 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
 the man then I asked for the ones I gave 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.610
 more cameras that can not be done 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.310
 exactly take this feature in the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.200
 shopping mall to be open or to blame is 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.370
 of the mouth what they will do well to count 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.590
 the lock of the mall doors 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.840
 center and will only open to people 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.370
 they want what they do not look 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.030
 that you are going to practice a little bone inside 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.190
 from the mall 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.840
 hence the people that way they will take the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.850
 main characteristic of the mall that 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.290
 is to be open to the public 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.970
 so this is the people who liked the video 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 of a free one that did not like a slide 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.960
 in and who I like too much favorites because 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.390
 helps to spread this modest channel 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.040
 beauty people were doing the levezinho 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.240
 stop suckling with little work 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.950
 thank you guys 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.950
 A hug for all I went
