Warriors can be upgraded in different
soldiers<00:04:47.360> that's<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.720> neat<00:04:47.870> concept<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.650> like

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
soldiers that's a neat concept I like

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.800 
soldiers that's a neat concept I like
the<00:04:49.070> artwork<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.700> game<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.150> like<00:04:50.570> how<00:04:50.750> you

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
the artwork to the game I like how you

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.870 
the artwork to the game I like how you
have<00:04:51.020> different<00:04:51.500> bonuses<00:04:52.010> some<00:04:52.250> bonuses<00:04:52.760> when

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
have different bonuses some bonuses when

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.060 
have different bonuses some bonuses when
you<00:04:52.970> draw<00:04:53.210> cards<00:04:53.630> that's<00:04:54.169> a<00:04:54.290> neat<00:04:54.440> idea

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
you draw cards that's a neat idea

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.090 
you draw cards that's a neat idea
however<00:04:55.700> all<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.690> coming<00:04:57.169> into<00:04:57.320> play<00:04:57.650> does

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
however all that coming into play does

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.300 
however all that coming into play does
not<00:04:58.430> matter<00:04:58.970> if<00:04:59.540> the<00:05:00.320> game<00:05:00.530> itself<00:05:01.040> is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
not matter if the game itself is

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.659 
not matter if the game itself is
somewhat<00:05:02.210> falled<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.930> here's<00:05:03.169> why<00:05:03.490> there<00:05:04.490> is

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
somewhat falled and here's why there is

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.150 
somewhat falled and here's why there is
absolutely<00:05:05.510> no<00:05:05.870> point<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.440> attacking<00:05:06.800> another

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
absolutely no point to attacking another

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.850 
absolutely no point to attacking another
player<00:05:07.520> because<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.570> hurts<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:09.020> just<00:05:09.260> as

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
player because it hurts you just as

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.880 
player because it hurts you just as
badly<00:05:10.130> as<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.490> hurts<00:05:10.700> your<00:05:10.850> opponent<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:12.410> might

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
badly as it hurts your opponent it might

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.580 
badly as it hurts your opponent it might
it<00:05:13.370> might<00:05:13.760> hurt<00:05:14.090> your<00:05:14.270> opponent<00:05:14.330> more<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.200> you

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
it might hurt your opponent more if you

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.719 
it might hurt your opponent more if you
take<00:05:15.770> your<00:05:15.860> time<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.100> do<00:05:16.190> attacks<00:05:16.460> but<00:05:16.610> the

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
take your time to do attacks but the

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.520 
take your time to do attacks but the
fact<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.060> all<00:05:17.270> attackers<00:05:17.750> are<00:05:17.930> decreased<00:05:18.350> by

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
fact that all attackers are decreased by

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.480 
fact that all attackers are decreased by
one

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
one

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.280 
one
and<00:05:19.640> so<00:05:20.480> you're<00:05:20.660> sitting<00:05:20.930> there<00:05:21.020> saying<00:05:21.080> okay

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
and so you're sitting there saying okay

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.870 
and so you're sitting there saying okay
I'm<00:05:21.500> gonna<00:05:21.590> attack<00:05:21.890> my<00:05:22.100> opponent<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.670> take

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
I'm gonna attack my opponent to take

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.090 
I'm gonna attack my opponent to take
them<00:05:23.060> out<00:05:23.270> as<00:05:23.420> much<00:05:23.630> as<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.870> possibly<00:05:24.320> can<00:05:24.590> but

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
them out as much as I possibly can but

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.500 
them out as much as I possibly can but
it<00:05:25.220> would<00:05:25.310> be<00:05:25.370> much<00:05:25.610> more<00:05:25.820> efficient<00:05:26.330> for<00:05:26.450> me

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
it would be much more efficient for me

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.880 
it would be much more efficient for me
to<00:05:26.660> take<00:05:26.810> all<00:05:26.990> my<00:05:27.140> soldiers<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.650> send<00:05:27.770> them<00:05:27.860> to

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
to take all my soldiers and send them to

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.590 
to take all my soldiers and send them to
the<00:05:27.950> king's<00:05:28.220> army<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:28.880> really<00:05:29.210> is

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
the king's army it really is

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.110 
the king's army it really is
sure<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.590> takes<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:30.980> few<00:05:31.370> turns<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.700> do<00:05:31.790> that<00:05:31.940> but

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
sure it takes a few turns to do that but

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.910 
sure it takes a few turns to do that but
each<00:05:32.360> soldier<00:05:33.050> you've<00:05:33.170> been<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.380> Kings<00:05:33.620> Army

each soldier you've been the Kings Army

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.370 
each soldier you've been the Kings Army
has<00:05:34.010> two<00:05:34.220> points<00:05:34.640> each<00:05:34.870> building<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.990> have<00:05:36.200> is

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
has two points each building you have is

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.350 
has two points each building you have is
one<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.490> say<00:05:37.640> I'm<00:05:37.760> going<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.940> disrupt<00:05:38.300> my

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
one so you say I'm going to disrupt my

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.330 
one so you say I'm going to disrupt my
opponent's<00:05:39.350> economy<00:05:39.770> I'm<00:05:39.860> gonna<00:05:40.040> go<00:05:40.190> and

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
opponent's economy I'm gonna go and

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.980 
opponent's economy I'm gonna go and
there<00:05:40.430> were<00:05:40.520> soldiers<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.300> just<00:05:41.480> destroy<00:05:41.930> it

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
there were soldiers and just destroy it

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.180 
there were soldiers and just destroy it
there's<00:05:42.260> nothing<00:05:42.320> he<00:05:42.560> didn't<00:05:42.740> do<00:05:42.830> about<00:05:43.040> it

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
there's nothing he didn't do about it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.350 
there's nothing he didn't do about it
I'm<00:05:43.280> gonna<00:05:43.400> lose<00:05:43.580> some<00:05:43.700> soldiers<00:05:44.060> along<00:05:44.210> the

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
I'm gonna lose some soldiers along the

I'm gonna lose some soldiers along the
way<00:05:44.480> big<00:05:45.230> deal

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
way big deal

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.590 
way big deal

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
he'll let you do that build a couple

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
soldiers send them to the king's army

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.950 
soldiers send them to the king's army
and<00:05:49.460> even<00:05:50.120> though<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.300> destroyed<00:05:50.570> his

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
and even though you destroyed his

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.070 
and even though you destroyed his
economy<00:05:51.380> he<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:51.950> still<00:05:52.250> ahead<00:05:52.370> of<00:05:52.520> you

economy he is still ahead of you

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.260 
economy he is still ahead of you
I've<00:05:54.620> thought<00:05:55.310> about<00:05:55.370> for<00:05:55.580> awhile<00:05:55.850> and<00:05:56.210> maybe

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
I've thought about for awhile and maybe

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.750 
I've thought about for awhile and maybe
the<00:05:56.660> designers<00:05:57.170> know<00:05:57.740> more<00:05:58.010> than<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.280> do<00:05:58.340> in

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
the designers know more than I do in

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.330 
the designers know more than I do in
this<00:05:59.120> in<00:05:59.390> this<00:05:59.630> regard<00:06:00.050> but<00:06:00.230> it<00:06:00.470> just<00:06:00.830> doesn't

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
this in this regard but it just doesn't

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.940 
this in this regard but it just doesn't
come<00:06:01.700> together<00:06:01.880> in<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.300> way<00:06:02.450> I<00:06:02.840> like<00:06:03.650> it

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
come together in that way I like it

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.250 
come together in that way I like it
but<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:04.640> whole<00:06:04.910> fact<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.390> that<00:06:05.660> is<00:06:05.810> that

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
but that whole fact that that is that

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.500 
but that whole fact that that is that
those<00:06:06.560> soldiers<00:06:07.250> using<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.880> king's<00:06:08.090> army<00:06:08.210> are

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
those soldiers using the king's army are

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.540 
those soldiers using the king's army are
double<00:06:09.110> any<00:06:09.350> buildings<00:06:09.950> you<00:06:10.070> build<00:06:10.250> in<00:06:10.370> town

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
double any buildings you build in town

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.710 
double any buildings you build in town
and<00:06:10.760> these<00:06:10.820> buildings<00:06:11.120> you<00:06:11.360> build<00:06:11.600> are

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
and these buildings you build are

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.810 
and these buildings you build are
expensive<00:06:12.500> soldiers<00:06:12.950> can<00:06:13.130> be<00:06:13.220> cheap<00:06:13.460> you<00:06:13.640> can

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
expensive soldiers can be cheap you can

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.940 
expensive soldiers can be cheap you can
get<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.000> soldier<00:06:14.390> out<00:06:14.450> there<00:06:14.810> send<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.740> up<00:06:15.830> and

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
get a soldier out there send it up and

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.090 
get a soldier out there send it up and
shoot<00:06:16.790> it<00:06:16.940> over<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.210> king's<00:06:17.420> army<00:06:17.720> easy<00:06:18.230> quick

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
shoot it over to king's army easy quick

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.530 
shoot it over to king's army easy quick
fast<00:06:19.640> lots<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.390> points<00:06:20.840> so<00:06:21.710> I<00:06:22.070> like<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.210> kinds

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
fast lots of points so I like the kinds

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.570 
fast lots of points so I like the kinds
of<00:06:23.600> the<00:06:23.810> game<00:06:24.020> but<00:06:24.440> I<00:06:24.470> cannot<00:06:25.010> recommend<00:06:25.340> it

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
of the game but I cannot recommend it

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.310 
of the game but I cannot recommend it
right<00:06:25.790> now<00:06:25.940> because<00:06:26.150> it<00:06:26.390> just<00:06:26.420> doesn't<00:06:26.960> work

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
right now because it just doesn't work

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.310 
right now because it just doesn't work
that<00:06:27.380> well<00:06:27.830> it's<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.640> neat<00:06:28.880> idea<00:06:29.050> but<00:06:30.050> this<00:06:30.140> is

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
that well it's a neat idea but this is

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.080 
that well it's a neat idea but this is
more<00:06:30.530> like<00:06:30.680> a<00:06:30.710> half-baked<00:06:31.370> game<00:06:31.700> this<00:06:31.940> is<00:06:32.060> a

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
more like a half-baked game this is a

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.450 
more like a half-baked game this is a
gamer<00:06:32.660> like<00:06:32.870> that's<00:06:33.350> employed<00:06:33.770> is<00:06:34.010> when<00:06:34.430> I

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
gamer like that's employed is when I

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.240 
gamer like that's employed is when I
went<00:06:34.670> over<00:06:34.910> the<00:06:35.000> rules<00:06:35.380> rules<00:06:36.380> on<00:06:36.620> carts<00:06:37.070> by

went over the rules rules on carts by

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.550 
went over the rules rules on carts by
the<00:06:37.310> way<00:06:37.460> something<00:06:37.760> I<00:06:37.970> not<00:06:38.360> a<00:06:38.390> big<00:06:38.660> fan<00:06:38.930> of<00:06:38.960> but

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
the way something I not a big fan of but
