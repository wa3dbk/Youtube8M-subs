economist Don Drummond thanks for coming
I<00:00:15.960> guess<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.260> always<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.529> year<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.830> save

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
I guess it's always a year to save

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.500 
I guess it's always a year to save
though<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.640> always<00:00:17.760> want<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> save<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> little

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
though you always want to save a little

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.450 
though you always want to save a little
bit<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.320> Canadians<00:00:19.830> don't<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.340> much

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
bit and Canadians don't do very much

bit and Canadians don't do very much
dough<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> much<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.480> 0<00:00:21.720> unbalanced<00:00:22.230> well

tell<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.880> terms<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> loony<00:00:24.660> in

tell me about in terms of the loony in

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.450 
tell me about in terms of the loony in
to<00:00:24.930> wear<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> where<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.740> gone<00:00:26.039> where<00:00:26.430> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
to wear it where it is gone where you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.029 
to wear it where it is gone where you
see<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> saw<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.619> course<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> was

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
see it going well I saw of course it was

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.120 
see it going well I saw of course it was
a<00:00:29.099> wild<00:00:29.400> ride<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:30.080> 2007<00:00:31.080> touched<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.619> dollar<00:00:31.800> tan

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a wild ride in 2007 touched a dollar tan

the<00:00:32.340> all-time<00:00:32.700> high<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> commodity

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the all-time high is really a commodity

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
the all-time high is really a commodity
play<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:34.890> say<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> fair<00:00:35.579> bit<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
play I would say there was a fair bit of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250 
play I would say there was a fair bit of
speculation<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> took<00:00:36.809> off<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
speculation when it took off to that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860 
speculation when it took off to that
all-time<00:00:37.680> high<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.309> commodity<00:00:39.030> prices<00:00:39.450> have

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
all-time high but commodity prices have

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.690 
all-time high but commodity prices have
virtually<00:00:40.590> doubled<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> last<00:00:41.219> couple<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
virtually doubled in the last couple of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
virtually doubled in the last couple of
years<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> dollar<00:00:42.570> went<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
years and the dollar went up with it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.440 
years and the dollar went up with it
we've<00:00:43.710> seen<00:00:43.920> commodity<00:00:44.399> prices<00:00:44.850> flatten<00:00:45.300> out

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
we've seen commodity prices flatten out

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
we've seen commodity prices flatten out
recently<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.230> seen<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> dollar<00:00:46.770> come

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
recently and we seen the dollar come

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
recently and we seen the dollar come
down<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> bit<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:48.270> 2008<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> expect<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
down a bit for 2008 I expect that with a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
down a bit for 2008 I expect that with a
slower<00:00:50.370> world<00:00:50.760> growth<00:00:51.059> led<00:00:51.390> by<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:51.809> slowdown

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
slower world growth led by some slowdown

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.930 
slower world growth led by some slowdown
in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> United<00:00:52.980> States<00:00:53.010> will<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.489> commodity

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
in the United States will see commodity

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
in the United States will see commodity
prices<00:00:54.329> particularly<00:00:54.570> all<00:00:54.840> pull<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> bit

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
prices particularly all pull back a bit

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
prices particularly all pull back a bit
not<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> lot<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> dollar

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
not a lot but a bit and see the dollar

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.810 
not a lot but a bit and see the dollar
sink<00:00:58.230> down<00:00:58.410> further<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.520> looking

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
sink down further so we're looking

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
sink down further so we're looking
forward<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.449> ninety-four<00:01:00.989> cents<00:01:01.289> us

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
forward to be about ninety-four cents us

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.700 
forward to be about ninety-four cents us
at<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> end<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> 2008<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.690> 90<00:01:03.989> cents<00:01:04.409> us

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
at the end of 2008 and about 90 cents us

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
at the end of 2008 and about 90 cents us
by<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> end<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> 2009<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.270> still<00:01:06.840> high<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.229> an

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
by the end of 2009 so still high from an

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.840 
by the end of 2009 so still high from an
historical<00:01:07.860> level<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.369> certainly<00:01:08.640> off<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
historical level but certainly off the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
historical level but certainly off the
recent<00:01:09.299> Peaks<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.530> reasonable

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
recent Peaks a little more reasonable

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.250 
recent Peaks a little more reasonable
for<00:01:11.010> manufacturing<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.260> most

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
for manufacturing as well I most

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260 
for manufacturing as well I most
manufacturers<00:01:13.950> probably<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:14.880> eighty

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
manufacturers probably have about eighty

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
manufacturers probably have about eighty
to<00:01:15.450> eighty-five<00:01:15.840> percent<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to eighty-five percent of the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.230 
to eighty-five percent of the
productivity<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> US<00:01:17.490> counterpart<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
productivity of the US counterpart so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820 
productivity of the US counterpart so
any<00:01:18.509> dollar<00:01:18.840> stronger<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
any dollar stronger and that's going to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
any dollar stronger and that's going to
be<00:01:19.979> tough<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:20.939> yeah<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> lot<00:01:21.390> easier

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
be tough for them but yeah a lot easier

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
be tough for them but yeah a lot easier
to<00:01:21.869> deal<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.080> ninety<00:01:22.560> cents<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> they're

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to deal with ninety cents and they're

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
to deal with ninety cents and they're
responding<00:01:23.670> their<00:01:24.000> bulking<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.900> machinery

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
responding their bulking up on machinery

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.300 
responding their bulking up on machinery
equipment<00:01:25.409> they're<00:01:25.890> becoming<00:01:26.189> more

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
equipment they're becoming more

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
equipment they're becoming more
effective<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.960> most<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> them

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
effective so I think that most of them

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
effective so I think that most of them
could<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.009> by<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.880> profit<00:01:30.270> margin<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
could get by with the profit margin of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.870 
could get by with the profit margin of
ninety<00:01:30.990> cents<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.470> most<00:01:31.680> machines

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
ninety cents the most machines

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
ninety cents the most machines
particularly<00:01:32.880> business<00:01:33.240> machines<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.720> for

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
particularly business machines or for

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.050 
particularly business machines or for
businesses<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.409> coming<00:01:34.619> from<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> states

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
businesses are coming from the states

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.429 
businesses are coming from the states
this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> silver<00:01:36.570> lining<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> dollar

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this is the silver lining of the dollar

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.380 
this is the silver lining of the dollar
we<00:01:37.740> import<00:01:38.189> seventy<00:01:38.579> percent<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:39.000> our<00:01:39.030> machine

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
we import seventy percent of our machine

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
we import seventy percent of our machine
equipment<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> number<00:01:40.860> one

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
equipment I think that's the number one

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410 
equipment I think that's the number one
reason<00:01:41.220> why<00:01:41.549> we're<00:01:41.700> less<00:01:41.880> productive<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
reason why we're less productive in the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
reason why we're less productive in the
US<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.960> don't<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> much<00:01:43.740> capital<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
US we just don't have as much capital to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.100 
US we just don't have as much capital to
work<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> golden<00:01:45.960> opportunity

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
work with this is a golden opportunity

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749 
work with this is a golden opportunity
to<00:01:46.649> bulk<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.340> machine<00:01:47.640> your

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to bulk up and not machine your

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
to bulk up and not machine your
equipment<00:01:48.090> businesses<00:01:48.570> were<00:01:48.659> slow<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
equipment businesses were slow off the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
equipment businesses were slow off the
mark<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> last<00:01:50.520> couple<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
mark but we see in the last couple of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.219 
mark but we see in the last couple of
quarters<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:51.840> ramping

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
quarters they really have been ramping

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
quarters they really have been ramping
up<00:01:52.320> their<00:01:52.470> investment<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.640> dollar<00:01:53.850> stays

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
up their investment so the dollar stays

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
up their investment so the dollar stays
hovers<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:54.899> around<00:01:55.140> 90<00:01:55.590> 95<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> said<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
hovers in around 90 95 as you said in

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
hovers in around 90 95 as you said in
the<00:01:56.640> new<00:01:56.759> year<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.930> another<00:01:58.290> break

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the new year then we get another break

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.190 
the new year then we get another break
another<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.070> percent<00:01:59.460> drop<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> GST<00:02:00.479> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
another one percent drop in the GST so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.389 
another one percent drop in the GST so
does<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> mean<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.799> should<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.040> running<00:02:02.310> out

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
does that mean we should be running out

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
does that mean we should be running out
to<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.549> store<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> buying<00:02:03.149> things<00:02:03.450> well<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to the store and buying things well it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
to the store and buying things well it's
interesting<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.469> we're<00:02:04.890> conditioned<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
interesting because we're conditioned to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.340 
interesting because we're conditioned to
think<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> strong<00:02:06.329> dollar<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.810> bad<00:02:07.020> but

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
think that the strong dollar is bad but

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
think that the strong dollar is bad but
it's<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.129> let's<00:02:08.399> enjoy<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:08.849> there

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it's here let's enjoy it because there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's here let's enjoy it because there
are<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.479> benefits<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:10.080> talked<00:02:10.319> about

are some benefits we talked about

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.650 
are some benefits we talked about
machine<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:10.920> equipment<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.879> import<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> lot

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
machine or equipment but we import a lot

those areas are about to cool off but
still<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.100> very<00:03:41.340> stable<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.880> Canada<00:03:42.270> we

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
still it's very stable in Canada we

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.330 
still it's very stable in Canada we
don't<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:42.930> fragile<00:03:43.380> subprime

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
south of the border is it a matter of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.090 
south of the border is it a matter of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
time though before it starts to hit us I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.310 
time though before it starts to hit us I
think<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.640> think<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.120> already<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:01.050> sense

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
think I think it already is in the sense

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.260 
think I think it already is in the sense
that<00:04:01.440> demand<00:04:02.190> for<00:04:02.370> our<00:04:02.400> exports<00:04:03.000> has<00:04:03.120> been

that demand for our exports has been

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.720 
that demand for our exports has been
very<00:04:03.450> weak<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.200> only<00:04:04.860> difficulty<00:04:05.340> hasn't

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
very weak the only difficulty hasn't

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.650 
very weak the only difficulty hasn't
been<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.940> exchange<00:04:06.270> rate<00:04:06.360> there's

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
been the exchange rate there's

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.390 
been the exchange rate there's
definitely<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.350> softening<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.890> our<00:04:08.010> Dressel
