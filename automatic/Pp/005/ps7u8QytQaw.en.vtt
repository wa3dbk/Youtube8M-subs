00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.290
 the most severe electrical system depends 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.400
 of the main energy systems 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.349
 21 the dynamo 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.349
 and the second the battery 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.930
 the system of a master 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.490
 fed that comprises the lights 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.560
 lateral 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.280
 that are 20 centimeters to withdraw 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.060
 10 on this side and 10 on the other side 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.210
 we also have 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.290
 a little normal 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 you come with a pact 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.829
 with dynamo's forgiveness and we have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.550
 installed 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.550
 a true eye 12 volt 6 watt 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.480
 since our dynamo from 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 the 25 km now produces a little more than 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.899
 Energy 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 and what is stipulated by the manufacturer 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.649
 The function that our battery fulfills is 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.120
 have a second system for never of 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.200
 weapons and music 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.950
 this plane is very good however everything 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.050
 it tends to scratch for use by water and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.960
 It is always good to have a system of 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.500
 backup such as the battery that in its 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.440
 case does not represent major inconvenience to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 the time of the transfer and it does not weigh 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.270
 a lot then it 's a 12 battery 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.570
 volts and I tramper since it's 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.020
 enough for four hours with lights 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 blue 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 while the dynamo is working load 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.690
 our battery with a system 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.720
 rectifier comprised by four 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.890
 fingers 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.100
 and a 16-volt filter 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.770
 you 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.450
 when we are going to let you work 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.230
 we have a system 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.760
 manual 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.900
 in the operation either of the disk 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.760
 for loading 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.760
 or the battery as late 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.830
 when we can not use our hands and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.340
 for example in the rain 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.380
 It is advisable to keep it away in 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.590
 a remote position and that not all 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 wheels in which case the whole load 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.060
 electric falls to the battery 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.170
 it is not advisable to draw light 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.069
 and the white field of the engine 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.890
 well it really is a voltage 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.760
 very very tiny and it will not work 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.730
 for nothing and on the other hand going to remove 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.849
 power to our engine that's not what 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.849
 we want 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.080
 and then this is the electrical system 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.080
 of the bike moto 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.300
 double system 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.250
 electric one main one that would be the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.180
 dynamo 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.620
 and the support that would be the battery 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.690
 really the two interact with each other 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.750
 because we estimate it is always loading the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.440
 battery but in case our 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.450
 let's say our alternate will fail 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.740
 then we would always have our 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.740
 blue charge battery
