00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
really anticipated and of course you're

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.130 
really anticipated and of course you're
out<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.119> kinds<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> weather<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.110> know

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.490 
news doesn't doesn't stop for for bad
weather<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.729> fact<00:01:20.970> news<00:01:21.780> often<00:01:22.200> occurs

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
weather and in fact news often occurs

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
weather and in fact news often occurs
when<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> when<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> weather<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> worst

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
when that when the weather is the worst

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
when that when the weather is the worst
so<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.229> working<00:01:25.320> outside<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> lot<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so so you're working outside a lot and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.030 
so so you're working outside a lot and
in<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.210> kinds<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> conditions<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.799> again

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
in all kinds of conditions and and again

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.850 
in all kinds of conditions and and again
sometimes<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.670> fun<00:01:29.880> sometimes<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.570> not

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
sometimes that's fun sometimes it's not

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.060 
sometimes that's fun sometimes it's not
I<00:01:33.530> guess<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> negative<00:01:37.409> side<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> getting

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
I guess the the negative side of getting

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
I guess the the negative side of getting
involved<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> community<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.060> sometimes

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
involved in the community is sometimes

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.120 
involved in the community is sometimes
you<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> cover<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.259> tragic<00:01:40.560> events

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you have to cover really tragic events

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
you have to cover really tragic events
which<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.329> something<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
which is which is something I don't like

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.300 
which is which is something I don't like
to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.490> some<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:45.380> some<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.250> the
