00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
verses there was text on either side of

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.750 
verses there was text on either side of
the<00:02:57.450> page<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:59.220> had<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.459> read<00:02:59.580> them

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the page and you had to read them

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.420 
the page and you had to read them
together<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.690> cross<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
together like a cross but then if you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.449 
together like a cross but then if you
read<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.849> other<00:03:03.000> words<00:03:03.360> from<00:03:03.660> like

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
read the other words from like

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.339 
read the other words from like
vertically<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.730> came<00:03:06.599> with<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> whole

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
vertically it came with a whole

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.110 
vertically it came with a whole
different<00:03:07.769> sentence<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.400> thought<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.790> was<00:03:08.940> so

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
different sentence I thought that was so

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.320 
different sentence I thought that was so
clever<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.250> much<00:03:11.430> harder<00:03:11.459> I've<00:03:12.120> said

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
clever and it's so much harder I've said

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.270 
clever and it's so much harder I've said
this<00:03:12.420> before<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.470> much<00:03:13.650> harder<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:14.160> write

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
this before it's so much harder to write

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.270 
this before it's so much harder to write
a<00:03:14.340> book<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.730> verse<00:03:14.940> seriously<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.280> you

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
a book in verse seriously because you

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.670 
a book in verse seriously because you
have<00:03:17.519> such<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> limited<00:03:18.329> amount<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:19.019> words<00:03:19.410> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
have such a limited amount of words that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560 
have such a limited amount of words that
you<00:03:19.859> can<00:03:20.070> use<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.579> it<00:03:20.820> has<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.239> really

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
you can use so that it has to be really

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.349 
you can use so that it has to be really
powerful<00:03:22.430> instead<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.579> just<00:03:23.730> adding<00:03:23.880> fluff

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
powerful instead of just adding fluff

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.750
