size this is quite small we'll go ahead

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530 
size this is quite small we'll go ahead
and<00:01:22.170> compare<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.649> here<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> soda<00:01:24.090> and

you can see that this is both a smaller

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.850 
you can see that this is both a smaller
and<00:01:28.579> skinnier<00:01:29.579> device<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.899> can<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> soda<00:01:31.409> so

and skinnier device and a can of soda so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.770 
and skinnier device and a can of soda so
basically<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.630> both

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
basically if you can see here it's both

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.429 
basically if you can see here it's both
3/4<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> height<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:37.259> terms

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
3/4 the height of this can and in terms

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.709 
3/4 the height of this can and in terms
of<00:01:37.619> width<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.490> about<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> size<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
of width it's about the size of the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.660 
of width it's about the size of the
rounded<00:01:40.229> section<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> top<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.219> a<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
rounded section of the top of a can of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
rounded section of the top of a can of
pop<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.750> small<00:01:43.020> pretty<00:01:43.740> portable

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pop so it's pretty small pretty portable

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
pop so it's pretty small pretty portable
and<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.869> weight

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and it does have a little bit of weight

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
and it does have a little bit of weight
to<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:46.979> pretty<00:01:47.490> nice<00:01:47.820> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to it which is actually pretty nice I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
to it which is actually pretty nice I
find<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.020> gives<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.289> sort<00:01:49.469> of<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
find that it gives it sort of like a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.520 
find that it gives it sort of like a
premium<00:01:50.250> feel<00:01:50.520> along<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> metal

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
premium feel along with the metal

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.429 
premium feel along with the metal
exterior<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> weight

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
exterior here and as with the weight

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
exterior here and as with the weight
you're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> stability<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.420> if

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you're going to get a stability so if

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.510 
you're going to get a stability so if
you<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.409> outside<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.219> going

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you do use this outside it's not going

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
you do use this outside it's not going
to<00:01:59.640> blow<00:01:59.820> away<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.409> weight<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to blow away because of the weight that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
to blow away because of the weight that
has<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.130> seems<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.549> bottom<00:02:02.939> heavy<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.420> well

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
has it seems to be bottom heavy as well

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.700 
has it seems to be bottom heavy as well
on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.619> bottom<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> has<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.000> nice<00:02:06.210> rubber

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
on the bottom here it has a nice rubber

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.990 
on the bottom here it has a nice rubber
section<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> also<00:02:08.640> help

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

switch<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.870> our<00:02:13.320> pairing<00:02:13.980> light<00:02:14.700> here<00:02:15.090> so

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
switch we have our pairing light here so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.030 
switch we have our pairing light here so
when<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.570> pair<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.140> will<00:02:16.320> light<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.740> in<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
when you pair it it will light up in a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.760 
when you pair it it will light up in a
blue<00:02:17.280> LED<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> pairing<00:02:18.990> button<00:02:19.260> which

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
blue LED you have a pairing button which

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.230 
blue LED you have a pairing button which
will<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.400> ahead<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.820> pair<00:02:21.030> this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
will actually go ahead and pair this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.830 
will actually go ahead and pair this
later<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.720> got<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> line<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.420> section<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.600> so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
later on got a line in section here so

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.430 
later on got a line in section here so
for<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.260> cable<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:25.950> your<00:02:26.100> us

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
for that cable you have your us

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.680 
for that cable you have your us
be<00:02:26.620> cable<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.340> then<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> charging<00:02:28.270> light<00:02:28.450> as

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
be cable and then a charging light as

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.770 
be cable and then a charging light as
well<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.290> top<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.730> basically<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
well up top we have basically the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.810 
well up top we have basically the
speaker<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.500> sound<00:02:32.830> is<00:02:32.980> going<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.460> come

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
speaker so the sound is going to come

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.100 
speaker so the sound is going to come
out<00:02:34.000> through<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.390> top<00:02:34.600> section<00:02:35.080> here

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
out through the top section here

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.530 
out through the top section here
hopefully<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.100> guys<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.310> see<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.420> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
hopefully you guys can see that it is a

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.210 
hopefully you guys can see that it is a
speaker<00:02:38.200> up<00:02:38.320> top<00:02:38.530> there<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.770> go<00:02:38.980> that's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
speaker up top there you go that's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.010 
speaker up top there you go that's
probably<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.640> better<00:02:39.760> look<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.570> that's<00:02:40.810> where

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
probably a better look but that's where

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.570 
probably a better look but that's where
your<00:02:41.170> sounds<00:02:41.470> going<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.650> come<00:02:41.830> from<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.280> just

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
your sounds going to come from so just

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.520 
your sounds going to come from so just
keeping<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> down<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:43.390> sound<00:02:44.140> comes<00:02:44.380> up

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
keeping it down like this sound comes up

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.440 
keeping it down like this sound comes up
from<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.860> top<00:02:45.040> all<00:02:45.610> right<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:45.940> now<00:02:46.090> let's<00:02:46.120> go

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
from the top all right so now let's go

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.620 
from the top all right so now let's go
ahead<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.050> pair<00:02:47.500> our<00:02:47.860> speaker<00:02:48.730> here<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.240> our

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
ahead and pair our speaker here to our

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.360 
ahead and pair our speaker here to our
device<00:02:50.020> here<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.410> I'm<00:02:50.500> using<00:02:50.650> an<00:02:50.800> iPhone<00:02:51.100> 5s

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
device here so I'm using an iPhone 5s

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.340 
device here so I'm using an iPhone 5s
you<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.060> use<00:02:52.180> an<00:02:52.300> Android<00:02:52.630> device<00:02:52.840> computer

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
you can use an Android device computer

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.290 
you can use an Android device computer
pretty<00:02:54.010> much<00:02:54.160> anything<00:02:54.460> that<00:02:54.610> has<00:02:54.850> bluetooth

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
pretty much anything that has bluetooth

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
pretty much anything that has bluetooth
capabilities<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.620> we'll<00:02:56.740> go<00:02:56.860> ahead<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.370> power

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
capabilities so we'll go ahead and power

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.620 
capabilities so we'll go ahead and power
on<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.600> speaker<00:02:59.430> makes<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.610> little<00:03:01.000> sound<00:03:01.330> not

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
on the speaker makes a little sound not

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.970 
on the speaker makes a little sound not
sure<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.020> heard<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:02.440> you'll<00:03:02.590> see<00:03:02.800> that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
sure if you heard it but you'll see that

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.520 
sure if you heard it but you'll see that
it<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.340> flashing<00:03:03.790> right<00:03:04.150> here<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:05.290> we'll<00:03:05.410> go

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it is flashing right here so we'll go

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.130 
it is flashing right here so we'll go
ahead<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.830> open<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.270> Bluetooth<00:03:07.660> section

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
ahead and open up the Bluetooth section

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.830 
ahead and open up the Bluetooth section
on<00:03:08.380> our<00:03:08.650> phone<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.730> turn<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.060> bluetooth<00:03:10.570> on

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
on our phone so turn it bluetooth on

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.580 
on our phone so turn it bluetooth on
obviously<00:03:11.710> it<00:03:11.860> would<00:03:12.010> be<00:03:12.040> important<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.590> then

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
obviously it would be important and then

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.470 
obviously it would be important and then
it's<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.220> either<00:03:15.490> pop<00:03:15.850> up<00:03:16.090> if<00:03:16.360> it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
it's going to either pop up if it

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.030 
it's going to either pop up if it
doesn't<00:03:16.780> pop<00:03:16.930> up<00:03:16.960> what<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.440> want<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.860> is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
hold on the pair button until it does

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.520 
hold on the pair button until it does
flash<00:03:21.660> multiple<00:03:22.660> times<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.080> it's<00:03:23.260> flashing

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
flash multiple times like it's flashing

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.710 
flash multiple times like it's flashing
right<00:03:23.830> here<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:24.880> you'll<00:03:25.030> see<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.480> appear

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
right here and then you'll see it appear

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.170 
right here and then you'll see it appear
on<00:03:26.140> your<00:03:26.350> device<00:03:26.620> we'll<00:03:26.920> go<00:03:27.070> ahead<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.370> tap<00:03:27.970> on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
on your device we'll go ahead and tap on

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.510 
on your device we'll go ahead and tap on
it<00:03:28.390> it'll<00:03:28.570> begin<00:03:28.750> pairing<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.370> take

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
it it'll begin pairing and this can take

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.130 
it it'll begin pairing and this can take
a<00:03:30.580> few<00:03:30.820> minutes<00:03:30.880> as<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.300> can<00:03:31.540> hear<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.930> beeped

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
a few minutes as you can hear it beeped

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.480 
a few minutes as you can hear it beeped
once<00:03:32.470> again<00:03:32.800> because<00:03:33.070> now<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:33.430> going

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
once again because now it's going

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.820 
once again because now it's going
through<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:34.030> pairing<00:03:34.420> stage<00:03:34.750> hopefully<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
through that pairing stage hopefully it

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.340 
through that pairing stage hopefully it
connect<00:03:36.130> without<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.580> problem

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
connect without a problem

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.780 
connect without a problem
so<00:03:38.350> it's<00:03:38.620> connected<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.340> now<00:03:39.490> we<00:03:39.550> can

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
so it's connected so now we can

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.660 
so it's connected so now we can
basically<00:03:40.000> use<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.200> speaker<00:03:41.680> anyway<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.400> want

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
basically use the speaker anyway we want

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.580 
basically use the speaker anyway we want
we<00:03:42.940> can<00:03:43.060> listen<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.420> music<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.930> actually<00:03:44.140> have

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
we can listen to music I actually have

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.610 
we can listen to music I actually have
some<00:03:45.300> copyright<00:03:46.300> free<00:03:46.840> music<00:03:46.870> here<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.500> we'll

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
some copyright free music here so we'll

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.530 
some copyright free music here so we'll
go<00:03:47.770> ahead<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:54.520> as<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.910> can<00:03:55.000> see<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.450> very

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
go ahead and as you can see it's very

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.650 
go ahead and as you can see it's very
loud<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.950> was<00:03:57.040> actually<00:03:57.400> on<00:03:57.580> full<00:03:57.910> volume<00:03:57.940> on

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
loud that was actually on full volume on

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.600 
loud that was actually on full volume on
my<00:03:58.810> iPhone<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.290> didn't<00:03:59.680> actually<00:03:59.830> expect<00:04:00.100> that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
my iPhone I didn't actually expect that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.000 
my iPhone I didn't actually expect that
but<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.480> guys<00:04:01.660> get<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:01.989> idea<00:04:02.530> if<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:02.830> actually

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
but you guys get the idea if I actually

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.610 
but you guys get the idea if I actually
raise<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.970> bit<00:04:04.180> that's<00:04:04.750> on<00:04:05.080> one<00:04:05.770> so

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
raise it just a bit that's on one so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.910 
raise it just a bit that's on one so
see<00:04:06.890> one<00:04:07.130> tech<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:08.239> pretty<00:04:08.599> loud<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.590> bass

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
see one tech it's pretty loud the bass

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.460 
see one tech it's pretty loud the bass
on<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.400> thing<00:04:10.670> is<00:04:10.819> insane<00:04:11.030> as<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.200> probably

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
on this thing is insane as you probably

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.559 
on this thing is insane as you probably
heard<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.190> was<00:04:13.280> probably<00:04:13.580> really<00:04:13.970> loud<00:04:14.180> and

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
heard it was probably really loud and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.390 
heard it was probably really loud and
didn't<00:04:14.930> really<00:04:15.080> sound<00:04:15.470> too<00:04:15.709> good<00:04:15.739> for<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.190> but

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
didn't really sound too good for you but

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.060 
didn't really sound too good for you but
that<00:04:16.549> means<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.910> bass<00:04:17.120> was<00:04:17.389> insane<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.650> keep

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
that means the bass was insane so keep

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.220
