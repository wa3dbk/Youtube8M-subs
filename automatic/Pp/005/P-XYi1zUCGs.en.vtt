this<00:00:10.059> project<00:00:10.120> because<00:00:10.719> you<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:12.790> when<00:00:12.910> I<00:00:12.969> was

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
this project because you know when I was

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.430 
this project because you know when I was
growing<00:00:13.330> up<00:00:13.450> in<00:00:13.660> Burnley<00:00:15.930> that<00:00:16.930> was<00:00:17.080> really

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
growing up in Burnley that was really

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.400 
growing up in Burnley that was really
the<00:00:17.619> start<00:00:18.279> of<00:00:18.369> my<00:00:18.580> inspiration<00:00:19.360> to<00:00:20.110> actually

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
the start of my inspiration to actually

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.070 
the start of my inspiration to actually
become<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.680> designer<00:00:20.980> anyway<00:00:21.490> but<00:00:22.420> because<00:00:22.810> of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
become a designer anyway but because of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.220 
become a designer anyway but because of
being<00:00:23.860> surrounded<00:00:24.310> by<00:00:24.640> so<00:00:25.180> much<00:00:25.600> good<00:00:25.840> design

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
being surrounded by so much good design

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.680 
being surrounded by so much good design
because<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.060> because<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.120> a<00:00:28.300> subculture

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690

communication of real avant-garde design
that<00:01:11.950> was<00:01:12.039> really<00:01:13.200> adopted<00:01:14.200> as<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:14.979> subculture

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
that was really adopted as a subculture

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.849 
that was really adopted as a subculture
and<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.359> just<00:01:16.600> found<00:01:16.719> that<00:01:16.929> fascinating<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.770> it

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
and I just found that fascinating and it

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.029 
and I just found that fascinating and it
really<00:01:18.179> inspired<00:01:19.179> me<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.749> turn<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.590> was<00:01:20.770> my

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
really inspired me to turn what was my

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.010 
really inspired me to turn what was my
art<00:01:21.369> at<00:01:21.639> the<00:01:21.670> time<00:01:21.939> which<00:01:22.149> were<00:01:22.299> just<00:01:22.479> sketches

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
art at the time which were just sketches

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.169 
art at the time which were just sketches
to<00:01:23.770> turn<00:01:24.009> them<00:01:24.189> into<00:01:24.340> something<00:01:25.029> you<00:01:25.119> know

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
to turn them into something you know

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.609 
to turn them into something you know
into<00:01:25.539> something<00:01:25.840> tangible<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.380> know<00:01:26.590> I

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
into something tangible you know I

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.370 
into something tangible you know I
started<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:28.090> aspire<00:01:28.509> towards<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.170> sign

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
started to to aspire towards the sign

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.349 
started to to aspire towards the sign
instead<00:01:29.889> of<00:01:30.009> instead<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.549> illustration<00:01:31.240> or

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
instead of instead of illustration or

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.129 
instead of instead of illustration or
art<00:01:31.539> and<00:01:32.249> and<00:01:33.249> so<00:01:34.209> I<00:01:34.240> began<00:01:34.539> working<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
art and and so I began working in the

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.050 
art and and so I began working in the
shops<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.560> sold<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.009> stuff<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.609> you<00:01:36.849> know

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
shops that sold the stuff and you know

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.149 
shops that sold the stuff and you know
we<00:01:37.869> had<00:01:38.079> kind<00:01:38.349> of<00:01:38.469> a<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.799> know<00:01:38.889> a<00:01:38.920> small

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
we had kind of a you know a small

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.069 
we had kind of a you know a small
community<00:01:39.490> around<00:01:39.969> around<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:40.840> sort<00:01:40.990> of

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
community around around that sort of

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.080 
community around around that sort of
design<00:01:41.439> which<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.099> still<00:01:42.249> have<00:01:42.490> open<00:01:42.789> Burnley

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
design which we still have open Burnley

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.489 
design which we still have open Burnley
you<00:01:43.179> know<00:01:43.299> all<00:01:43.509> my<00:01:43.630> may<00:01:43.779> still<00:01:44.049> work<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
you know all my may still work in the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.629 
you know all my may still work in the
shops<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.170> he's<00:01:47.289> funny<00:01:47.529> because<00:01:47.709> it<00:01:48.490> was

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
shops and and he's funny because it was

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:53.179 
shops and and he's funny because it was
particularly<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.929> goggle<00:01:50.259> jacket<00:01:50.709> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
particularly the goggle jacket that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.849 
particularly the goggle jacket that
there<00:01:54.189> was<00:01:54.310> probably<00:01:54.849> the<00:01:55.029> pinnacle<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
there was probably the pinnacle of of

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.429 
there was probably the pinnacle of of
that<00:01:57.700> design<00:01:58.060> ethos<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.749> really<00:01:58.990> inspired

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
that design ethos that really inspired

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.819 
that design ethos that really inspired
me<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.779> know<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:01.990> urban<00:02:02.139> protection

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
me because you know the urban protection

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.649 
me because you know the urban protection
stuff<00:02:03.099> came<00:02:03.999> and<00:02:04.209> when<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:06.159> did<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.179> transform

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
stuff came and when as did the transform

but<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.610> interesting<00:02:09.970> thing<00:02:10.119> about<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
but the interesting thing about the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.699 
but the interesting thing about the
goggle<00:02:10.630> jacket<00:02:10.990> is<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.380> was<00:02:11.500> always

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
goggle jacket is that it was always

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.470 
goggle jacket is that it was always
there<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.280> know<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.459> could<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.000> could<00:02:13.209> rely

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there you know you could you could rely

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.570 
there you know you could you could rely
on<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.800> was<00:02:14.980> always<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.370> shop

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
in this black space you know this it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.940 
in this black space you know this it's
almost<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.239> idea<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.720> sometimes<00:02:56.850> fashion<00:02:57.850> or

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
almost the idea of sometimes fashion or

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.449 
almost the idea of sometimes fashion or
garment<00:02:59.950> design<00:03:01.560> maybe<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:02.830> more<00:03:02.980> important

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
garment design maybe it's more important

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.550 
garment design maybe it's more important
when<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:03.730> not<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.180> body<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:05.200> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
when it's not on the body you know and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.650 
when it's not on the body you know and
that's<00:03:05.769> what<00:03:05.920> makes<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.280> not<00:03:06.940> fashion<00:03:07.390> but

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
that's what makes it not fashion but

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.050 
that's what makes it not fashion but
product<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:09.400> think<00:03:09.550> that's<00:03:09.670> very<00:03:09.730> very

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
product and I think that's very very

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.500 
product and I think that's very very
important<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.810> be<00:03:10.840> able<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.110> show<00:03:11.319> that
