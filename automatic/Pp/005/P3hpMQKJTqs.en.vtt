00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.720
 The figure skater Kim Yu-na finally left for Sochi. 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:15.210
 The jump of Kim Yu-na is close enough to be called the figure's textbook. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.920
 Such luxury jumps are possible through numerous exercises , 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.640
 It's because it melted. 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.640
 I have been a reporter. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.930
 Oh 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.280
 The figure queen slides smoothly over the ice, following a stringy string melody 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.840
 It is 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:39.640
 Spinning up, spinning , with arms wide open 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.440
 It is a three-round performance of Kim Yu-na who is called a textbook of jumping 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:49.270
 Kim's jump is much longer than the other players 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.850
 Unlike other players who have slowed down all at once, 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.620
 I keep jumping 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.590
 The speed of rotation in the air is also a feature of the Kim Yu-na jump 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 It's all about getting your arm wide open and turning. 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:09.729
 The arm length 5cm points more than the average key, such as 68 cm 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.649
 Obtaining the Gwang-An turnovers is of course much more elegant. 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:19.750
 It is for fast rotation that the arm is maximized in the air . 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:22.810
 Shoulder and waist ankle center of gravity perpendicular to the gravity of the body will prevent rotation 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.069
 This is because resistance is reduced. 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.360
 You can finish the rotation as early as that and prepare for landing in the right action 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.009
 It is. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 Also when in August suddenly the idea janseupnikka Doing so thus assembled in the big furniture 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.940
 To maintain the impact 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.690
 That's why the speed of rotation is relatively fast. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:48.640
 Gimhae fishing boats can be seen to be doing well after that 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.470
 When landing, we hit a weight of 6kg, 300kg , 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.240
 Is delivered 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.619
 But Kim's athlete's muscles are thin and long, but enjoyable and elastic. 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 Can absorb shocks well 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.399
 Kim Yu-na completed her mastery of the law of potions with her natural talent and long training 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.629
 A player's luxury performance 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:13.430
 Her second gold challenge is on the 20th. 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.430
 ytn is Science Yang Yang.
