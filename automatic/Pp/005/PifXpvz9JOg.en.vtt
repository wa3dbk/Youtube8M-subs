00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.890 

speed<00:00:22.130> up<00:00:22.279> induction<00:00:23.350> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.460 

finally

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:45.250 

about<00:00:38.010> six<00:00:38.310> seconds

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.440 

okay<00:00:45.470> this<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.070> full<00:00:46.280> speed<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:46.880> AC

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
okay this is the full speed of the AC

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.490 
okay this is the full speed of the AC
induction<00:00:47.690> motor<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.649> is<00:00:48.680> rotating<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.500> now

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
induction motor that is rotating and now

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.830 
induction motor that is rotating and now
we're<00:00:51.680> gonna<00:00:51.920> stop<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.610> SP<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.070> see<00:00:55.070> that

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
we're gonna stop it SP and see that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.190 
we're gonna stop it SP and see that
resistance<00:00:56.840> towards<00:00:57.230> breaking

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.710 

it's<00:01:02.649> about<00:01:02.860> two<00:01:03.070> seconds<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:06.180> practice<00:01:07.180> had

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
it's about two seconds and practice had

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.399 
it's about two seconds and practice had
already<00:01:07.870> stopped<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:10.750> efficient<00:01:11.260> in

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
already stopped so it is efficient in

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.959 
already stopped so it is efficient in
breaking

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.830 

the<00:01:17.390> rotation<00:01:17.929> of<00:01:18.109> the<00:01:18.350> rear<00:01:19.270> axle<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.569> a

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the rotation of the rear axle of a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.380 
the rotation of the rear axle of a
vehicle<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.069> when<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:22.369> axle<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.759> in<00:01:22.909> rotation

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
vehicle so when the axle is in rotation

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.309 
vehicle so when the axle is in rotation
basically<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:25.399> axle<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:26.450> attached<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.079> this

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
basically the axle is attached to this

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.359 
basically the axle is attached to this
shaft<00:01:27.649> which<00:01:28.310> rotates<00:01:29.409> which<00:01:30.409> rotates<00:01:30.770> as<00:01:30.979> as

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
shaft which rotates which rotates as as

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.179 
shaft which rotates which rotates as as
the<00:01:32.920> vehicle<00:01:33.920> moves<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:35.270> then<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.780> disc<00:01:36.200> is

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
the vehicle moves and then this disc is

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.169 
the vehicle moves and then this disc is
has<00:01:37.849> only<00:01:38.000> magnets<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:38.929> it's<00:01:39.729> it's<00:01:40.729> it

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
has only magnets but it's it's it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.149 
has only magnets but it's it's it
doesn't<00:01:41.509> rotate<00:01:41.659> it's<00:01:42.469> attached<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.979> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
doesn't rotate it's attached to the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.959 
doesn't rotate it's attached to the
shaft<00:01:43.429> which<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:44.420> coupled<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:44.929> motor<00:01:45.969> this

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
shaft which is coupled to a motor this

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.510 
shaft which is coupled to a motor this
motor<00:01:47.240> will<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> magnetic<00:01:48.530> force<00:01:49.159> that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
motor will have the magnetic force that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.209 
motor will have the magnetic force that
is<00:01:49.640> enough<00:01:49.879> to<00:01:50.179> slow<00:01:51.170> down<00:01:51.379> the<00:01:51.649> rotation<00:01:51.799> of

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
is enough to slow down the rotation of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.949 
is enough to slow down the rotation of
the<00:01:52.429> rear<00:01:52.579> axle<00:01:53.030> when<00:01:53.239> the<00:01:53.329> brake<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:53.689> crushed

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
the rear axle when the brake is crushed

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.260 
the rear axle when the brake is crushed
when<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.709> brake<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.069> thrust<00:01:55.310> basically<00:01:55.939> this

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
when the brake is thrust basically this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.039 
when the brake is thrust basically this
this<00:01:56.989> part<00:01:57.319> here<00:01:57.679> this<00:01:58.399> rig<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:59.000> moves<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.899> this

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
this part here this rig it moves to this

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.949 
this part here this rig it moves to this
side<00:02:00.319> along<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.489> screw<00:02:02.469> along<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.649> scoop<00:02:03.890> so

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
side along the screw along the scoop so

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.419 
side along the screw along the scoop so
so<00:02:05.959> basically<00:02:06.349> we<00:02:06.530> will<00:02:06.619> see<00:02:06.860> how<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.069> works

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
so basically we will see how it works

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.319 
so basically we will see how it works
now<00:02:08.140> okay<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.250> power<00:02:10.429> supply<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
now okay this is the power supply and it

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.960 
now okay this is the power supply and it
like<00:02:11.629> turn<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.109> power<00:02:12.260> supply

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.180 

okay<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:16.200> increase<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.650> speed<00:02:16.710> slowly

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
okay I will increase the speed slowly

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.670 
okay I will increase the speed slowly
and<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.850> see<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.210> rotation

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
and you can see the rotation

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
and you can see the rotation
of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.530 

there<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.829> no<00:02:30.010> contact<00:02:30.459> between<00:02:30.760> these<00:02:31.329> two

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
there is no contact between these two

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.690 
there is no contact between these two
plates<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.860> working<00:02:33.250> based<00:02:33.489> on

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
plates but it's working based on

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.400 
plates but it's working based on
magnetic<00:02:34.510> rotation

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.690 

so<00:02:39.240> yeah<00:02:40.270> as<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.620> see<00:02:41.800> while<00:02:42.340> this

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
so yeah as you can see while this

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.500 
so yeah as you can see while this
rotates<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.510> DC<00:02:43.870> motor<00:02:44.110> here<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.880> DC<00:02:46.270> motor

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
rotates the DC motor here this DC motor

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.500 
rotates the DC motor here this DC motor
which<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:46.990> attached<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> multimeter<00:02:48.510> which

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
which is attached to a multimeter which

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.480 
which is attached to a multimeter which
is<00:02:49.660> attached<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.230> multimeter<00:02:50.740> generate

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
is attached to a multimeter generate

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.330 
is attached to a multimeter generate
electricity<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.680> can<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.100> number

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
electricity and you can see the number

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.750 
electricity and you can see the number
of<00:02:54.370> holes<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:56.440> increase<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.190> speed<00:02:57.520> of

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
of holes we increase the speed of

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.470 
of holes we increase the speed of
rotation

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.760 

our<00:03:04.099> interpretation<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.380> see<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
our interpretation and you can see the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.820 
our interpretation and you can see the
increase<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.550> the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
increase in the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.720 
increase in the
voltages<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.700> has<00:03:10.970> been<00:03:11.150> generated
