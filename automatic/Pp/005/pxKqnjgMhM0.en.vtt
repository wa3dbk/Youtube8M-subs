00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:12.189
 hello call me this rate would be this depend the head that moves is a 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.729
 capillary massager that I have been given in what is called management of the ex ogre 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 how do you see any back and forth movement that is reflected with a fireman who reactivates 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.650
 the blood circulation of the entire scalp 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 it is the blood that contributes in the axes of the nutrients that feed the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 roots of the ball the hair bulbs 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.300
 as a result of hair loss 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.250
 what makes you grow again 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.900
 in the first of the thermographies a decrease in temperature is observed 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.450
 with a hotter area on the right side 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 in this area the highest temperature point of the thermography was located 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.730
 comparing it with its trivalent point on the opposite side the difference of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 temperature is more than one cato 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.790
 after 10 minutes of capillary stimulation with stimuli but one is 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.270
 observe how the heat that was once concentrated in the area is now beginning 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.620
 to distribute for the rest of the scalp 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.330
 appears in reddened areas the maximum temperature point moves towards the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.640
 center of the street 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.430
 the general temperature 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.950
 After 20 minutes of stimulation it is perfectly observed how the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.700
 temperature is distributed evenly over almost the entire surface 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.040
 of the head 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 the temperature difference between two textile analog points 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.930
 After 30 minutes of stimulation the effects that are appreciated to simple 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.870
 view 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.660
 the temperature is distributed evenly over the entire surface 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.960
 disappearing the marked differences that we had at the beginning between the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.650
 analogous points 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.130
 activating blood circulation with massage did not cause an increase 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.160
 of the temperature but a homogenous distribution once 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.640
 not only do we have obvious benefits of capillary river increase but also 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.810
 We produce coffee headaches migraines by eliminating the foci 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.800
 of heat concentrated in a specific area
