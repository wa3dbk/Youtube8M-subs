00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.180
 will help them first if they are not 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.370

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.100
 let's put this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.070

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.060

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 All this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.750
 the only thing that can not be saved in the 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.030
 map are the chests and the boxes of 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.310

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.540

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.850
