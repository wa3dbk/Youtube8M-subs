00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.280
 I took the third line 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.989
 that of the 67 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:57.069
 because because we actually use a 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:59.489
 laptop pc and that's it and on pc fixed in 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.709
 the files are finished so we 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.750
