 what is called pspv 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.259
 this 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:13.769
 memory 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.999
 I may die 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.999
 preparation of transport of security of our native towns 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.019

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.669
 altogether 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.669
 there we introduce in any of those crazy 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.640
 the Protestants 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.920
 the awards 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.120
 but apparently the red dot 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.850
 next 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 of apsa 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.899
 we see how it is 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.210
 spreading 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.660
 the green light 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 but we have to wait 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.450
 that is completely green on this 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.460
 will come out 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.840
 the menu 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.230
 from three in three 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 we approved control 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 claim 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 ing as a solution 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.080
 then in the menu it will not appear 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.440
 this attack 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.820
 just before we installed it 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 finished this device that is called 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 go year 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.500
 they have installed it goes to the page 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 PD of the same 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.500
 ps3 name and that the common point 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.090

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.160
 the wonder marvels install it 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.380
 bounces for boston 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.410
 circle 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.360
 and there they did not show the page that says that if we want to use this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.429
 device 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.859
 world with women 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.639
 and all of them inside the hard drive I only have is 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.529
 sherry cf three quarters 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.929
 I exceeded 13 3 and 4 did not 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.269
 so what are we going to do now 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.269
 we have our hard drive of 500 kilos 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.139
 we count 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.139
 copper collapsed 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.699
 and not in the end 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.699
 but start reading 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.599
 all our people were going to appear 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.599
 when what we have gordon seventh in this case I have 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.969
 percent and the yen when I buy hinson I say pelfrey 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.179
 this is a bit difficult not 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.789
 so 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.449
 for us to start playing this was what we have 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.610
 went into his hard drive curled director in mind 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.679
 place 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:14.539
 one 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.269
 original 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.179
 in this case 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.559
 place a bonucci monument 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.079
 in Japan not 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.969
 antique 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.969
 in we produce 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.149
 of combat to meter will appear and also the section 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.259
 antonio 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.259
 lacking ever pm screen hahaha 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.679
 professional baseball 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.109
 despite regret 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.149
 professional 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.719
 the baseball 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.119
 p 4 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.369
 gcc here the Japanese does not 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.529
 then there what you do not say 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.049
 try x 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.739
 to play the game 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.119
 offer circle to be a mouth in this process all 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.859
 let's be a little bit in all that we're 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.279
 fenavÃ­n you want to save it on the external hard drive 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.199
 the cnc that I have we can believe 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.039
 and the race begins 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.439
 let's start cafma 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.710
 for Carlos Navarro 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 begins to be the engine of the original game 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.259
 of course it takes about 20 to 30 minutes depending on the game 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.949
 It has good 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.240
 on the other hand it's a bit because it takes 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.370
 in that case they are just like that 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.580
 in discussing the pap 32 is formatted 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.669
 in full paper format for what 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.689
 can be stored crazy 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.749
 we return more or less when this town does not train percent 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.850
 sending as you will see, you have finished defining the vote 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.759
 and now 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.449
 zappos com ar 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.430
 one below we see that we have two 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.819
 professional a downtown hotel 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.759
 and again from local 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.559
 only that at work he says 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:35.449
 Hello 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.349
 the zero back 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.199
 and the bid and ccoo 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.139
 any other time at oscar 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
 but in this case, what we are going to do is play for example 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.069
 when to open nozar 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.069
 remove from disk 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.139
 Jay Z 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.960
 the bottom 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.029
 professional by wolves or by the round 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:02.610
 it is mandatory that 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.560
 you are 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.039
 a game inside 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.089
 the price and they are for us we have provoked 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.520
 there this new newspaper appeared again 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 to 11 we tried initial for example 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.409
 then for three 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.409
 the defeat 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.409
 let's go squeeze 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.409
 what matters x to read 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.729
 that is to say that it is to read 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.710
 photo alfonso conde 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.710
 mikel mate to pass will not return again 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:44.089
 - of the prestige company 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.020
 so 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.080
 instead of understanding the game 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.550
 we pretend 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.699
 of baseball will not be able to be 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.529
 we will overthrow it 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:01.119
 and today temporarily some circle stretches put together more famous 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.169
 slowly from our 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.470
 HDD 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.710
 esther 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.740
 percent 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.319
 but since he does not 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:16.099
 of Europe 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.149
 to Spain 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:21.740
 i good nothing else 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.889
 the same as he 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.089
 the manger and that he 

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.229
 ask to be always connected 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.490
 always while san juancito pinto connected 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.759
 the expedition has to be by a version 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.039
 percent to 3 141 

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.489
 this neighbor in his profile according to the previous races version 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:46.240
 three points 41 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.860
 on the same page of the ps3 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.839
 breivik the point with 

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:53.800
 they have paradox the penetration of 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.800
 blunt 42 thousand will be for the first time 

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:01.399
 but that you like 

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:05.059
 because he asked climbing bridge 

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.479
 we're 

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:10.479
 and right now but as if by a little bit of the elbow 

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:13.110
 in Spain
