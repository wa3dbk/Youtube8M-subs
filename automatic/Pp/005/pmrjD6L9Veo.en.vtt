00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 

first<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.719> set<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> camera<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.469> 0<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:26.039> 125

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
first I set the camera is 0 on 125

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.029 
first I set the camera is 0 on 125
because<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> want<00:01:27.539> really<00:01:27.840> noise-free<00:01:28.200> clean

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
because I want really noise-free clean

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.520 
because I want really noise-free clean
blacks<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.149> slow<00:01:30.390> shutter<00:01:30.689> speed<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.289> can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
blacks and a slow shutter speed so I can

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
blacks and a slow shutter speed so I can
blur<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> lines<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> cars<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:32.909> drive

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
blur the lines of the cars as they drive

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
blur the lines of the cars as they drive
by

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.349 

the<00:01:36.500> second<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.009> set<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.310> camera<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.759> AV<00:01:38.329> or

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
the second I set the camera to AV or

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.270 
the second I set the camera to AV or
aperture<00:01:38.780> priority<00:01:39.140> mode<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.829> do<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.219> because

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
aperture priority mode I do this because

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.429 
aperture priority mode I do this because
I<00:01:40.759> want<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:41.090> select<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.509> aperture<00:01:41.960> i'm<00:01:42.140> going

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
I want to select the aperture i'm going

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.830 
I want to select the aperture i'm going
to<00:01:42.530> use<00:01:42.619> f<00:01:42.829> 9

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.590 

third<00:01:48.679> I<00:01:48.890> set<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.219> color<00:01:49.460> balance<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.909> 3,600

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
third I set the color balance to 3,600

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.569 
third I set the color balance to 3,600
degrees<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:51.560> tungsten<00:01:52.159> which<00:01:52.310> would<00:01:52.490> be

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
degrees it's not tungsten which would be

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.240

3,000 or daylight which would be 5,000
it's<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.969> setting<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.390> will<00:01:56.689> allow<00:01:56.869> the
