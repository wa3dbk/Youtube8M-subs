 life has changed because since 2013 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
 where I decided to end my life 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.050
 in the high-level world that does not want 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.300
 say not to run but I have already left 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.220
 to pursue the dreams of the great 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.680
 championships and now I dedicate myself to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 Enjoy the sport from another point of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.690
 sight I have not been all my life during 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.100
 18 years training for and to get 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.380
 a medal in a championship for me 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.180
 country and now I 'm racing to enjoy it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.520
 best 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.540
 and I'm enjoying new challenges 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.890
 new adventures and then I'm going now 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.780
 preparing two deserts that I have left 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.820
 for my big goal of the year that makes 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.520
 the courts in the great slam four 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.780
 deserts had never run more than 42 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.440
 kilometers and this year I'm putting 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.119
 a lot very often and I'm leaving shortly 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 chile 'atacama where good I hope to continue 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.260
 being at the height and to try 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.380
 combine that great challenge of the year that 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.670
 suppose doing 4 desert of 250 km in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.410
 survival mode that is not bad 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 it's a pass and besides running for the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.009
 desert you're swimming is doing in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.300
 bicycle watching and I've put on that 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.880
 I told you what I have put on 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 parachute out there that does not because they are very 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.090
 planets there yes that the saying of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.739
 Running is cowardly or crazy is true 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.850
 that of going by bicycle and to a certain 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.220
 level you have to be a certain value 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.739
 You also see a little more of yourself but 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 well I was used to there fast 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.830
 when I ran before 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.440
 years ago it was going very fast so the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.090
 speed and good I'm discovering 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.150
 so new sports new disciplines 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.530
 during this state for 18 20 years 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 living a permanent concentration 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.820
 always trying to improve my records 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.780
 fighting the best and now it 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.640
 I do what any other 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 if you want to do a marathon that is 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.020
 do and where it is true that you have to 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.310
 make an ironman because that is one more a 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.920
 great is more of this that wants to have 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.690
 goals and fight to do it and I'm 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 delighted is fantastic is what counts 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.330
 it's fantastic with call fits very 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250
 well with the philosophy of the runners 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 popular that more and more people 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 runs and what happens is that until 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.590
 certain point you are a popular runner 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.569
 we welcome you to our world 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.280
 he is writing but he is an athlete 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.720
 of elite sure that you keep training 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.400
 a lot of hours I guess your 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.540
 trainings will have changed 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.480
 changed a lot that his workouts 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.230
 done less hours would send no 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.840
 really what has changed my life has 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.540
 been that I have three children exerted 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.300
 journalist I write I also dedicate myself to 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.870
 the conferences and I do many things and 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.060
 I really do not have enough now in 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.670
 the day is 24 and I would need two or three 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.430
 more to be able to do everything I want 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.290
 do not and my life has changed a lot 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.330
 but I'm still training, I'm a murderer 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.220
 to train I am a killer I love 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.709
 I love to train, you always have to give 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.750
 the best of me and I train the same or more than 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.970
 before it happens that other levels is 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.100
 true that rhythms I do not have everything 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.930
 so programmed because 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.690
 now my agenda depends on other things 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.400
 of commitments that I have to make and already 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.260
 the goal I do not have it so 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.870
 planned as I did before but 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.480
 I keep training tomorrow and afternoon there 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.830
 doubles the same double even this time 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.330
 proven that I can do four 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.270
 sessions a day when I'm preparing 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.590
 well that's that small attempt to get me 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.630
 in the world of tri I've done a 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.730
 half ironman then training three and 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.280
 four times a day and I really am 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.989
 used to train I like and I continue 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.120

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.390
 with my two sessions every day and 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.780
