 video taken down from the channel and 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.010
 Although not because of the reason no 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 act I had no desire or 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.579
 somehow for a different reason 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.129
 but simply for the reason that I have the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 I managed to achieve quota jukic 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.760

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.399

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.050
 sunday is done on 26 2013 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.670
 I have the gameplay already a few 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.440
 youtuber sent some said lanz 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 high and have not reported 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 but good is everyone's own thing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.750
 I can not change that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 One thing has already been said 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.649
 because that takes away the gameplay from me 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.929
 I have german top games with you 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.640
 pretty good contacts so since he has now 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.679
 quite often from me so papis gameplays 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 and so uploaded this time very much the 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.440
 I did not play solo 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.300
 but has been supported that must 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.310
 you forgive me but many I think 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.009
 I know that I'm good solo too 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.200
 and yes that with the support yes 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 really just that i only did that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.179
 have to crack this world record 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.709
 Of course I will continue like that 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.379
 invited the quadro to try and who knows 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.060
 maybe I'll have it very soon 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:50.700
 Let's take a look at the quad new gameplay 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.810
 As I said before , the quad i had 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 mine after 150 years already score 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.720
 and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 yes I think I'm even with 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.260
 40 died at the end so yes me 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 I want to overdo it now but I would have 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.229
 I better concentrate western what 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.660
 with the commuter but I was 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.650
 Just screaming around on the wheel 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.510
 succeeded yes and into the grain after 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 had hewn out of the piece was the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.690
 ennstal 171 to 7 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.600
 one would say that we have really stable 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.830
 the whole works if 23 hours 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.290
 So I 've tried that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.700
 always done by one day and me 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.140
 just believe the key to success 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.430
 that was then finally fans 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.709
 has played there is a right 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.420
 learn the player 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.860
 and yes I do not know if it 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.120
 but I really liked him 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.840
 I could already imagine 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.100
 So we had it, I say so 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.209
 told him what he should do and 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.790
 Of course the other people are there 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.720
 were I said where the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.390
 and of course they have to do that 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.730
 Everybody heard it correctly every time 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.930
 every round it worked but 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.940
 Of course not alright but it did 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.410
 every round everything worked perfectly just 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.930
 Me sometimes I would be jobbed and what 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.190

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.959

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.060
