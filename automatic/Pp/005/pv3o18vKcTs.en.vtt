00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
not user replaceable battery but we did

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.520 
not user replaceable battery but we did
up<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.500> battery<00:01:59.799> life<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:01.080> 1730<00:02:02.080> milliamp

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
up the the battery life to 1730 milliamp

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.469 
up the the battery life to 1730 milliamp
hours<00:02:02.860> which<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.280> an<00:02:03.520> improvement<00:02:03.940> over<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
hours which is an improvement over the

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.940
