00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.139
 welcome to amsterdam we drive today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.820
 the golf tsi bluemotion it's the first 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 times that Volkswagen a three-cylinder 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.040
 installed in the golf 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is the first time that one 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.029
 benzinmotor the title bluemotion bears 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.470
 what dare he really can 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.840
 consumed that we look now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.419
 but also have the new golf tsi 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.809
 bluemotion is a four meter golf course 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.030
 25 length and 1 meter has 79 width 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.579
 he the same size outside and inside as 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.440
 know this from the gulf as with all 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.239
 other models are also the golf 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.220
 bluemotion high quality and offers 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 Plenty of facilities around 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.210
 to configure individually 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 the list of possible safety 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.900
 assistant and infotainment systems 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.460
 leaves hardly any wishes open 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.930
 also from the outside is the golf tsi 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 bluemotion easy to distinguish from 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 his brands brothers on the one hand 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.489
 the bluemotion sign on the front and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 at the rear but we also have one 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 other grille is in the grille 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.540
 a lamella how can open 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 close that is good for the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.290
 motor cooling resp 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.759
 Warming the engine to control large 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 value has been placed on the aerodynamics 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.840
 This lamella adds something extra 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.490
 the vehicle is 15 mm flat so 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 lower than the normal golf and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.460
 we have new spoilers on the hack 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.590
 additional spoilers 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.929
 All these things together are optimally about 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.700
 to improve the air resistance 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.409
 In addition, the tsi bluemotion has over 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.289
 smooth running tires with less 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.329
 rolling resistance the new engine is not 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.759
 only smaller and lighter he consumed 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.159
 mean less less cylinders 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.249
 less friction but what made him 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.149
 internally as 211 named engine like that 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.420
 especially 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.289
 i am with the cylinder head earlier me 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 In the cylinder head one sees here is the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.409
 Exhaust manifold in cylinder head 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.079
 merged the exhaust manifold that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.289
 means we save the exhaust manifold 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.869
 and we can use it in the exhaust 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.420
 Cool down the cylinder head and save 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.060
 us the Vorleistungen in addition the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.340
 Advantage that the cooling water relative 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.659
 warm up quickly that is called im 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 karlstadter motor much faster 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.539
 have warmly remembered 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.130
 then it also builds very compact from the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.170
 weight of the cheaper and iso 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.660
 cheaper perhaps because of that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.980
 highlight if why have go here 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.380
 we separate head blog cooling 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.640
 can realize about these modules 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.739
 where the water pump is the same 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.989
 this is always integrated here 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.819
 and the beautiful is about this module 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.830
 can have different temperatures in front 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.390
 so below where you like it a bit 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.030
 heat is due to mature performance 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.709
 formally higher temperatures and in the head 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.300
 but take care with a cooler head 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.519
 Keep the motor of the with the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.530
 combustion again gurtner three-cylinder 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.080
 Motors like to be louder and running 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.900
 more restless than eg aggregate with 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.940
 four-cylinder you the desired 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.150
 to teach running culture demands 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.769
 some technical gimmicks of the golf tsi 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.180
 blue motion has a three-cylinder 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.010
 board we already said that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480
 interesting one is one notices at all 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.220
 not that you drive a three-cylinder 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.870
 The car is agile as well as 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.450
 four-cylinder of the car is very quiet 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.220
 strikingly quiet that you eg in the city 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.079
 or at very slow speed drive the engine 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.640
 almost does not hear and really hardly 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.680
 noise from the outside to penetrate 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.250
 very nice is the characteristic 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.630
 of the motor 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.030
 He feels like a four-cylinder 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.250
 and running along with the dsg gear 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.100
 he is very neat so for the everyday 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.690
 ride perfectly suited to the typical 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.250
 jerking a three-cylinder while 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.780
 could start and stop the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.880
 wolfsburger not quite 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.600
 suppress the stop start automatic 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.010
 is more noticeable than other models 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.830
 otherwise you hardly notice any differences 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.900
 to the previous one 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.150
 our engine has more power and more 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370
 torque than the four-cylinder 1.2 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.010
 liter tsi engine from volkswagen nevertheless 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.720
 click vw consumers with 4.3 liters 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.130
 if we will achieve that it will become 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.710
 show up but now looks very 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.780
 neat from the new golf tsi 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.550
 bluemotion is available with either one 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.730
 six-speed manual or the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.740
 siebengang-dsg consumption is this 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.490
 Do not change the standard golf 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.650
 the 115 ps and a maximum of 200 newton meters 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.670
 accelerate the golf in 9 7 seconds 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.310
 on pace 100 at 204 km 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.230
 is final these values ​​are for the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.780
 everyday use certainly more than 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.440
 sufficient with a starting price of 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.220
 20 tsi bluemotion is around 20 1450 euro 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.040
 1000 euros more expensive than the 110 ps 12 liters 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.950
 four cylinder the fuel economy of 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.100
 around 0.6 liters per 100 kilometers and the 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.810
 Co2 emissions of only 99 grams will therefore 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.600
 In Germany hardly enough reason for 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.490
 be a buy in countries the clear 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.740
 tax relief for vehicles with 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.230
 an emission value of less than 100 grams 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.710
 co2, however, they offer this quite differently 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.320
 out 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.180
 Nevertheless, the engine acts more agile than the 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.700
 four-cylinder and scores at power 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.169
 torque and consumption during our 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.520
 test rides with the new golf tsi 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.160
 bluemotion we have all the time 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.620
 tries the 4.3 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.140
 the vw states to reach completely without 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.360
 chance we were always at 49 51 too 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.040
 with careful gasfoot then fell to us 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.430
 however on it was warm we had the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.480
 Air conditioning at 32 degrees outside temperature 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.460
 Air conditioning off and on 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.380
 Average consumption fell to 3.3 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.060
 liter today on the way to the ski resort 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.080
 have managed a normal 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.830
 Intersection on the highway with tempo 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.120
 a maximum of 110 of 4.4 liters to drive that 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.740
 clearly shows if you dare 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.150
 Carefully driving is one 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.380
 average consumption of 5 liters 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.260
 no problem 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.220
 and that's for 115 hp golf 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.220
 really good value
