 download the text were there are contents 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.780
 all source of this this pair of 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.460
 radius and we select all and do 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.940
 install in this case me that I already have 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.850
 installed new accounts but it was almost 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.640
 what remains of the other font that was a 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.369
 payment 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.120
 this therefore well said new cards not 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.780
 only 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.610
 make it last but also enumerate for each 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.070
 card hands still seen which are different 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.690
 different levels then bronze and silver 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.060
 gold 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.520
 I remind you anyway, you know when 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.600
 work on a specific card not 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.610
 maybe put all three cards also 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.550
 if it should have too many problems 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.590
 anyway for safety 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.230
 just keep an active card 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.120
 some tonnage as we have seen a little 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.870
 last to fear staff 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.580
 select with the text tool here 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.220
 automatically dials the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 reference level then that text 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:22.489
 we are here miss the text has changed 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.569
 this thing also in these parts 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.329
 rare card legends here for the logo of 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.319
 legends attention I live put here 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.579
 in the teams the work of reading 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.290
 century here so it will pass you can save 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.230
 close save automatically will come 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 inserted the logo 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 here I did some folders but it seems 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.530
 that you will then save us 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 all all the logos the championships this 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.810
 because I didn't want to do a fail too 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.280
 great 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.319
 I could have done for every league 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.389
 all the teams however would be st 20 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:13.739
 really heavy file ran the 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:16.049
 we cement ship of us then oh well 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.310
 for the I do I have tried to do the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.889
 face with foot and then saving over 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.340
 to the legend version there are also 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:33.139
 tod's and toti and as you can see 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:35.010
 it starts from the tops in silver gold and gold 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:39.810
 toti 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.639
 I remember that these cards are not that 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.269
 I 'm not concept on those 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.579
 own original official picas 15 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.310
 I remind you of other small parentheses for 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.000
 don't let the texts wake up for each 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.950
 folder are 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.370
 I am therefore sure every folder that is 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.330
 on his stars then with activated with and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.720
 modified as the text will change 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.700
 only the text for this folder 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.700
 type in this case we do not know was 3 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.920
 but then when you put it like legends 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.519
 reading carlo foot not when there 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.510
 put back you will and rare card will be 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.700
 however rodriguez 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.970
 so to change into this you will have to 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.970
 select this rare warmth 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:38.169
 coming back here as you see they pass into the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:41.410
 part to the other will change here moreover 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.570
 there is left only three levels for 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.640
 change peace for this taste because 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:51.790
 therefore both independently of which 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.730
 kind of cards I put you in 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.960

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:04.660
 same then toti with the various versions 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.190

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.210
 what a difference of the other folders though 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.270
 the subfolders are divided this 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.419
 because each font has its own color some 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.210
 for lebron, that is, to wear a light brown 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.750
