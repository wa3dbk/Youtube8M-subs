00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
little dance thing why do they do that

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.199 
little dance thing why do they do that
is<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> only<00:04:11.370> way<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:12.030> they<00:04:12.150> can

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
is that like the only way that they can

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.420 
is that like the only way that they can
move<00:04:12.510> around<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.110> mean<00:04:13.319> it<00:04:13.620> seems<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.250> it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
move around I mean it seems like it

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.640 
move around I mean it seems like it
would<00:04:14.519> be<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.700> lot<00:04:14.970> more<00:04:15.209> energy<00:04:15.650> conservative

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
would be a lot more energy conservative

would be a lot more energy conservative
it<00:04:17.609> would<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:18.410> serve<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.440> lot<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:19.919> energy<00:04:20.370> if

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
it would like serve a lot more energy if

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.640 
it would like serve a lot more energy if
you<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.820> you<00:04:21.239> know<00:04:21.329> walk<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:21.870> normally<00:04:22.440> you
