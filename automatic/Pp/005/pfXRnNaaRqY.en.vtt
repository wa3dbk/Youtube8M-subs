 topic of the lesson 2 chess abstract 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 chess notation is called a system 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.269
 field marks on the board and notes 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.710
 parties as well as individual positions 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 a lot of the strongest chess players could 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
 play blindly that is without looking at the board 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 since they knew well where the field was 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.869
 is vertical on a chessboard 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:35.100
 have the following notation vertical 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:39.260
 abc defghi horizontal and which 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 denoted by numbers from 1 to 8 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.879
 the intersection of the vertical and horizontal and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 gives a field designation for example a one 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:56.250
 b2c 3d two and so on when recording 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.489
 The following abbreviations are used. 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:10.400
 name of pieces king er-6f rook l elephant 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.400
 with knight to pawn and pawn two n signs 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.440
 notice that first 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.100
 record position 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.159
 white figures then the position of black figures 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 the record comes from a vertical 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.979
 verticals as many as two pawns or two 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.830
 the figures are on the same vertical 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 first recorded lower starting from 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.680
 White then top for example pawn a two 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.320
 then pawn a3 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:49.460
 pause the video after 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.460
 you write compare to record on screen 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.140
 now when you compare your 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.000
 wall screen, record demonstrating th 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.610
 batch full notation put the figures and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 pawns to the starting position and we write 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.860
 full notation and 2nd 4 of 7 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.560
 e5 is denoted initial field and of course 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 and field

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:45.209
 the move is recorded with a question mark queen 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:49.200
 d8 h4 Shah black then uses 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:53.820
 White's bad move is therefore set! 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 it's a good move king e1 g22 mark 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.459

 in abbas brief notation 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.650
 K-course and take the field and for example a pawn 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.350
 denoted by two letters 1 which 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.460
 initial vertical pawn finding 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:32.970
 and the second vertical on which is a pawn 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:38.940
 moved and so we write e4 e5 f4 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.940

 intersect the diagonal a3 f8 and vertical

 good move knight r f6 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.419
 notice f6 can go horse 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.030
 d7 so we must denote 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.120
 vertical from which goes horse horse r on 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.979
 f6 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.940
 this is also a blunder two question marks 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.039
 and the queen and beats on f7 mate answers to 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.470
 homework you can look at 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.490
