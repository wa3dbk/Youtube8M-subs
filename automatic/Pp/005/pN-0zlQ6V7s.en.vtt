00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.900
 good morning my friends are today 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:14.200
 working on what is the splice of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.980
 two woods to make the width of a 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.410
 of a door for sink are four 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 doors that that true and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.180
 we are doing the splice that is going to 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:32.140
 do what would be the final door let's 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:36.460
 to give a panning a vision of something 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.059
 we are going forward there we see one 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.500
 of the small door panels of 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:48.310
 about 60 and 9.5 centimeters in height with 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.880
 43 centimeters wide 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.150
 we see there are some of the things 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.010
 tools that we use for this 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.290
 work is a hobby work is done 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.530
 with pleasure because we do it without charge 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.650
 nothing so we present this panel to 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.380
 that some who want to learn a little 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.870
 about what is the splice as well as 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:19.510
 other videos we will go up there we see 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.070
 the two parties that are going to be joined 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.630
 we also see part of the other unions 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.759
 what we have to do 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.909
 then are the tools that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.020
 we use to do this work in 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.939
 our workshop and a workshop prepared 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.200
 good to move forward to do jobs 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.200
 of hobby 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.920
 incidents of how it will be done 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.100
 this junction of the sink doors 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 any other door is made 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.070

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.330
