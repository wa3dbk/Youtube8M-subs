00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 and 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.299
 you 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 hello the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 pick up your red card and make a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.140
 rectangle of 36 x 26 centimeters now 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.239
 at the top and bottom of the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.720
 side of 36 centimeters let's do 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.239
 marks at 28 and 30 centimeters both 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.510
 up and down and we're going to join with a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510
 line 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.330
 when you have it, let's turn the 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.410
 figure and now we will make marks at 6 12 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.870
 18 and 24 centimeters also from above 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.220
 down both up and down and let's go 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 to dial with a line 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
 and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.119
 when you're done, we're going to cut these 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.840
 parts of here for us to stay 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.530
 separated with your scissors let's go 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.060
 to cut out in the middle of these squares and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.789
 this part of here we are going to remove it 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 Now let's do exactly the same 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.850
 with the top side we are going to cut 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.040
 up to this line here 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.170
 to separate the squares and that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.270
 can fold our box easily 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.560
 We also cut this piece because 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 we are not going to need it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 and now let's cut three of these 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.539
 these would be the tabs but 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.200
 as we only need one to be able 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.110
 close then we will simply leave a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.269
 have a figure like that when you have it 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.140
 let's mark the folds with something of 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.140
 round tip 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.570
 Now these two kilos are going to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.490
 cut as they will be lashes and good we 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.040
 we will cut diagonally now 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.990
 we simply make the folds 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.420
 corresponding and we are simply going to 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.820
 fold and there is this little picture here 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.220
 we are also going to cut it because it's good 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.350
 we only need three since two will be 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.380
 the ears and the other will be the lid now 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.700
 let's proceed to paste simply 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.880
 we stick some glue on the bar 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.430
 in this tab here and we put it together and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.410
 now on the covers in these squares 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.230
 that were left here that did not stay with 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.220
 eyelashes we're just going to throw them 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 glue and let's go sticking one 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.650
 over another this will be the basis of 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.050
 our box or the fund for which 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.660
 must be well insured when 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
 We are going to make a strip of 22 x 2 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.840
 centimeters 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.420
 of white cardboard which we are going to 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.060
 proceed to paste what would be in the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.670
 front or on the front face of 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.340
 our box 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.770
 this now how shirt or 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.080
 I do not know the jacket brooch I do not know 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.790
 how they call it and good to be sure 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.680
 simply that it is well stuck and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.980
 now with black cardboard we are going to do 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.730
 a piece of 25 x 3 centimeters to the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.160
 which we will make marks at 6 12 18 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.190
 and 24 centimeters both above and below 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.819
 we are going to mark them and proceed to 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.819
 fold them 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200
 and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.090
 ah 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.390
 to make the sheet simply 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.420
 used a cardboard box 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.390
 I have made 4 x 4 centimeters white 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.580
 a form like bracket or something like that and 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.660
 in the center I just cut a 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.760
 figure a rectangle so that good as 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.700
 that it looks like it's a 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.950
 sheet that is around the belt of 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.410
 our box simply with glue 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.540
 we will stick it on top of the belt 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.300
 black and now simply also with 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.340
 black cardboard we're going to do 2 to 3 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.550
 buttons 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.750
 for the santa claus jacket and then 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:02.230
 we proceed to stick them 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:05.520
 and she answers in this way there will be 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.370
 finished your thing now simply 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.240
 we can close easily and can leave 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.270
 in it the gift you want to give you can 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.180
