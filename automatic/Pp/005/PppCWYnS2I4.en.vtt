formed<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.740> now<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:44.330> want<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.659> let<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.840> twist

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
formed and now you want to let it twist

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.710 
formed and now you want to let it twist
so<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.620> pull<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.250> ends<00:04:46.580> up<00:04:46.759> don't<00:04:47.180> let<00:04:47.449> go

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
so you pull the ends up don't let go

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.040 
so you pull the ends up don't let go
hold<00:04:48.229> both<00:04:48.590> ends<00:04:48.919> with<00:04:49.370> one<00:04:49.729> hand<00:04:50.210> and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
hold both ends with one hand and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.839 
hold both ends with one hand and
actually<00:04:51.169> kind<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.800> pick<00:04:52.009> up<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.310> Hat<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
actually kind of pick up the Hat and

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.270 
actually kind of pick up the Hat and
start<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.810> twist<00:04:54.169> if<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.770> hang<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.130> in<00:04:55.250> the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
start the twist if you hang it in the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.670 
start the twist if you hang it in the
air<00:04:55.520> will<00:04:55.909> kind<00:04:56.659> of<00:04:56.719> twist<00:04:56.990> on<00:04:57.139> its<00:04:57.289> own<00:04:57.469> but

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
air will kind of twist on its own but

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.969 
air will kind of twist on its own but
you<00:04:57.830> can<00:04:58.070> turn<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:59.570> Hat<00:04:59.780> with<00:05:00.139> your<00:05:00.289> hand<00:05:00.620> and

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
you can turn the Hat with your hand and

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.570 
you can turn the Hat with your hand and
when<00:05:01.849> it<00:05:02.000> has<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.180> nice<00:05:02.539> tight<00:05:02.990> spiral<00:05:03.580> you're

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
when it has a nice tight spiral you're

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.430 
when it has a nice tight spiral you're
going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.270> knot<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.080> end<00:05:07.419> once<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.659> end<00:05:08.990> is

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
going to knot the end once the end is

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.040 
going to knot the end once the end is
knotted<00:05:09.740> then<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.849> can<00:05:11.060> let<00:05:11.210> go<00:05:11.509> it<00:05:11.719> will<00:05:11.900> no

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
knotted then you can let go it will no

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.689 
knotted then you can let go it will no
longer<00:05:13.630> untwist<00:05:14.630> on<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.430> pull<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.460> knot

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
longer untwist on you and pull the knot

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.089 
longer untwist on you and pull the knot
tightly<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.449> I<00:05:17.570> like<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.139> be<00:05:18.229> about<00:05:18.529> three

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
tightly and I like it to be about three

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.050 
tightly and I like it to be about three
or<00:05:19.190> four<00:05:19.400> inches

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
or four inches

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.480 
or four inches
to<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.360> knot<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:21.020> then<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:21.860> can<00:05:22.040> trim<00:05:22.340> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
to the knot and then you can trim the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.280 
to the knot and then you can trim the
ends<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.720> they're<00:05:23.900> nice<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.139> even<00:05:25.120> and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
ends so that they're nice and even and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.409 
ends so that they're nice and even and
you're<00:05:27.290> gonna<00:05:27.470> repeat<00:05:28.070> with<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.030> other<00:05:29.180> side

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
you're gonna repeat with the other side

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.909 
you're gonna repeat with the other side
and<00:05:29.690> again<00:05:30.230> I'm<00:05:30.320> going<00:05:30.470> to<00:05:30.530> show<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:30.800> the

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
and again I'm going to show you the

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.840 
and again I'm going to show you the
twist<00:05:31.220> again<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.830> weight<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.340> hat<00:05:34.550> will

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
twist again the weight of the hat will

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.780 
twist again the weight of the hat will
help<00:05:35.120> form<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.810> spiral<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:37.520> on<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.780> second

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
help form the spiral and on the second

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.680

end<00:05:44.960> up<00:05:45.080> with<00:05:45.139> a<00:05:45.290> twist<00:05:45.650> that's<00:05:45.889> around<00:05:46.130> the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
end up with a twist that's around the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.940 
end up with a twist that's around the
same<00:05:46.340> length<00:05:46.970> and<00:05:47.300> about<00:05:47.450> the<00:05:47.780> same<00:05:48.080> depth<00:05:48.740> of

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
same length and about the same depth of

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.340 
same length and about the same depth of
spiral<00:05:49.610> as<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:49.970> other<00:05:50.120> one<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:50.600> pick<00:05:50.900> up<00:05:51.050> and

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
spiral as the other one so pick up and

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.030 
spiral as the other one so pick up and
compare<00:05:52.570> before<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:53.960> not<00:05:54.169> remember<00:05:54.740> don't
