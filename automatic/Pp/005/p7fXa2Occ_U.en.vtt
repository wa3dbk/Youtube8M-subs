00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.217
 Hi (Bob). 

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:10.761
 Good morning (Kelly). The lily looks gorgeous 

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:14.966
 Have you ever wondered how dogs see the world? 

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.581
 What you see is, 

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.696
 Does not take into account. 

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.266
 But what you are telling is a completely different story. 

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.381
 We will start from her wonderful and sophisticated nose. 

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.400
 Where your dog picks up the first breaths of fresh air, 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.725
 The wet sponge outside the nose helps to catch any odors loaded with air. 

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.465
 The ability to smell separately with each nostril 

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:39.099
 Especially smell the smell separately 

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:41.797
 Helps determine the direction of the source of odor 

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:44.265
 In the first few moments of inhalation 

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.291
 The dog begins to realize not only what kind of things are there 

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.695
 But also their positions. 

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:52.303
 Air enters the nose, 

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:56.101
 A small fold of fabric is divided into two separate layers, 

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.151
 One for breathing and another for the nose only. 

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.140
 The other flowing air enters the areas 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.262
 Full of olfactory cells 

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:08.534
 Hundreds of millions of cells compared to only our five million 

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.391
 Unlike our way of breathing enter and exit the air through the same corridor 

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.313
 The dogs are forgiven through the side openings of the nose, 

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:19.491
 By creating air vortexes to help draw new odor molecules 

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.148
 Let the odor focus to build more than a blot together. 

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:27.716
 But all of my wonderful nose structure is not of great benefit 

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:32.562
 With nothing to handle the information that arrives from the nose slots 

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:36.996
 It turned out that the olfactory system was designed to treat odors 

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:42.655
 This requires more space in the dog's brain area than humans 

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.487
 All this makes dogs distinguish 

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:48.155
 You remember amazingly a variety of smells 

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:53.416
 With a concentration of less than 100 million times the ability of our noses to discriminate 

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.082
 If you have the ability to smell aromatic in a small room 

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.780
 The dog can smell it in a closed football field 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.542
 And distinguishing its components in addition. 

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:05.768
 Everything in the street, every person or car pass 

00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:08.060
 Whatever the trash can contain, 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.568
 Each tree type 

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:11.556
 And all the birds and insects 

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:15.830
 Have a distinctive smell Tell your dog what they are, where they are, 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.977
 And in any direction moving. 

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:21.161
 Besides being much stronger than our noses, 

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:26.042
 The dog can smell things he has not seen at all 

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.967
 The olfactory system is completely separate 

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:31.505
 It is called nasal ulcer, above the roof of the mouth, 

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:36.033
 It detects the hormones of all animals, including humans naturally 

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.310
 This allows dogs to identify prospective friends 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.550
 Or to distinguish between friendly or hostile animals 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 And alert them to our emotional situations 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.396
 They can tell us about a sick or pregnant person. 

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.117
 Because their sense of smell is more fundamental than other senses 

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:54.400
 By bypassing the hypothalamus for direct contact with brain structures 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.993
 Involving passion and instinct, 

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:01.625
 We may say that the perception of dogs is deeper and more direct than humans 

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.165
 But the most amazing thing about your dog's nose 

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.343
 Is that he can pass the time. 

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:09.340
 The past appears in paths left behind by passersby, 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.977
 From a car parked recently 

00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:16.887
 Where the remains of the places I visited and what I have done recently. 

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:18.807
 Monuments such as fire hydrants and trees 

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:21.884
 They are scouring billboards bearing the messages of those who were, 

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:23.330
 And what they were eating, 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.198
 And how they felt during it. 

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:26.771
 The future is in the breeze 

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:31.386
 It alerts them to someone or something approaching before you see it. 

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.841
 Where we see and hear something in one moment, 

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.092
 The dog sniffs a whole story from beginning to end. 

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:41.075
 Some of the best examples of human relationships with dogs: 

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.414
 Dogs help us by engaging and responding to those stories 

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:47.368
 Dogs can respond gently with people who have problems 

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.131
 Or in the case of threat 

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.928
 Because stress and apparent stress seem like a cloud of hormones 

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:54.507
 Can be distinguished at the dog's nose 

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:55.792
 With appropriate training 

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.196
 It can alert us to hidden threats 

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.925
 From bombs to cancer 

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:03.180
 He turned out to be the best friend of humanity 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.528
 It is not possessed of abilities that differ from our abilities 

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:11.762
 But who reveals to us his wonderful nose is another world that our eyes can not discover.
