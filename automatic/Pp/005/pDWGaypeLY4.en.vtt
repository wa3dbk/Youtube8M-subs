track how the
we're<00:00:16.170> looking<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> belt<00:00:16.800> CP<00:00:17.250> hurt<00:00:17.490> here

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
we're looking at a belt CP hurt here

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
we're looking at a belt CP hurt here
which<00:00:17.939> is<00:00:18.150> pretty<00:00:18.810> common<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> east<00:00:19.800> guy

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
which is pretty common on the east guy

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
which is pretty common on the east guy
models<00:00:20.400> including<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> king<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.689> the

models including the king but the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
models including the king but the
principles<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> same<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:23.160> whatever

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
principles are the same for whatever

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.210 
principles are the same for whatever
model<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.710> first<00:00:28.980> thing<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
model that you have the first thing that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.549 
model that you have the first thing that
we're<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.579> look<00:00:29.700> at<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.559> feathering

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
we're going to look at is feathering

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.160 
we're going to look at is feathering
shaft<00:00:31.970> now<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.030> feathering<00:00:33.360> shaft<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
shaft now the feathering shaft is the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
shaft now the feathering shaft is the
piece<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> metal<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.309> sits<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> middle

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
piece of metal that sits in the middle

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.330 
piece of metal that sits in the middle
of<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.480> grips<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> grip<00:00:37.829> screw<00:00:38.160> into

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of these grips and the grip screw into

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.630 
of these grips and the grip screw into
it<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> grips<00:00:39.510> rotate<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.640> if

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it and it's what the grips rotate on if

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
it and it's what the grips rotate on if
that<00:00:41.910> feathering<00:00:42.300> shaft<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> damaged<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that feathering shaft is damaged that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
that feathering shaft is damaged that
typically<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> crash<00:00:45.000> where<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.510> any

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
typically in a crash where you get any

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.439 
typically in a crash where you get any
kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> blade<00:00:46.379> strike<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.489> shaft<00:00:48.179> will<00:00:48.359> be

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
kind of blade strike the shaft will be

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of blade strike the shaft will be
bent<00:00:48.690> slightly<00:00:48.960> any<00:00:49.499> slight<00:00:50.010> bend<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
bent slightly any slight bend in that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.479 
bent slightly any slight bend in that
shaft<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.600> mean<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.929> the<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.219> blades

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
shaft will mean that the the blades

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
shaft will mean that the the blades
won't<00:00:53.730> track<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.870> size<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> bent

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
won't track because the size that bent

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.770 
won't track because the size that bent
will<00:00:56.190> always<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.670> out<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> alignment<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
will always be out of alignment with the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
will always be out of alignment with the
other<00:00:57.899> side<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.339> easiest<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.909> to<00:00:59.940> check

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
other side so the easiest way to check

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
other side so the easiest way to check
if<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.749> fly<00:01:00.929> bar<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.319> bent<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:01.800> suspect

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
if a fly bar is bent if you suspect

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
if a fly bar is bent if you suspect
that's<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> case<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.839> take<00:01:04.050> off<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that's the case is to take off the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
that's the case is to take off the
blades<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.040> then<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.150> screwdriver

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
blades and then put your screwdriver

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
blades and then put your screwdriver
into<00:01:07.440> one<00:01:08.340> end<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> feathering<00:01:09.150> shaft

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
into one end of the feathering shaft

into one end of the feathering shaft
screws<00:01:09.870> don't<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.409> anything<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.370> just<00:01:11.700> rotate

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
screws don't do anything but just rotate

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.870 
screws don't do anything but just rotate
it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.080> watch<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.740> blade<00:01:13.979> grip<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> other

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it and watch the blade grip on the other

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.710 
it and watch the blade grip on the other
side<00:01:15.350> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.800> watch<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.490> blade<00:01:18.030> grip<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
side if you watch that blade grip and it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.149 
side if you watch that blade grip and it
prescribes<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.560> circle

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
prescribes a circle

prescribes a circle
I<00:01:20.189> eat<00:01:20.880> doesn't<00:01:21.060> sit<00:01:21.329> still<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> means

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I eat doesn't sit still then that means

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.289 
I eat doesn't sit still then that means
it's<00:01:22.619> bent<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.579> it<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> other<00:01:23.909> side

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it's bent if you do it on the other side

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.350 
it's bent if you do it on the other side
you'll<00:01:25.079> see<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.649> it's<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.579> problem<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you'll see if it's got a problem if

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.459 
you'll see if it's got a problem if
you're<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.780> sure<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.630> golden<00:01:30.630> rule<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.840> take

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
you're not sure the golden rule is take

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.380 
you're not sure the golden rule is take
the<00:01:31.590> furthering<00:01:31.950> shaft<00:01:32.219> out<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.969> roll<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the furthering shaft out and roll it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.859 
the furthering shaft out and roll it
across<00:01:33.539> a<00:01:33.780> piece<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> glass<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.180> rolls<00:01:36.479> true

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
across a piece of glass if it rolls true

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.959 
across a piece of glass if it rolls true
then<00:01:37.560> you'll<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.979> okay<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.610> pop<00:01:38.820> it

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
then you'll be okay and you can pop it

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.170 
then you'll be okay and you can pop it
back<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.119> second<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> check

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
back in the second thing to check

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.920 
back in the second thing to check
is<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:45.110> fly<00:01:45.320> bar<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.310> fly<00:01:46.520> bar<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.660> long

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
is the fly bar the fly bar is this long

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.110 
is the fly bar the fly bar is this long
piece<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.740> metal<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.370> runs<00:01:49.580> through<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:49.940> top

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
piece of metal that runs through the top

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.320 
piece of metal that runs through the top
of<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.330> head<00:01:51.130> with<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.220> fly<00:01:52.400> bar<00:01:52.640> bar<00:01:52.850> paddles

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
of the head with the fly bar bar paddles

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.960 
of the head with the fly bar bar paddles
on<00:01:53.570> either<00:01:53.900> end<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.770> has<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.310> be<00:01:55.430> straight<00:01:55.760> if

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
on either end it has to be straight if

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.060 
on either end it has to be straight if
it<00:01:56.120> isn't<00:01:56.480> straight<00:01:56.780> then<00:01:57.440> you'll<00:01:57.650> find<00:01:57.950> that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
it isn't straight then you'll find that

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.380 
it isn't straight then you'll find that
tracking<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.760> tricky

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
tracking is tricky

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.110 
tracking is tricky
again<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.530> usually<00:02:00.680> sight<00:02:01.250> down<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.790> put

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
again you can usually sight down it put

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.000 
again you can usually sight down it put
a<00:02:02.150> ruler<00:02:02.360> against<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> side<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.619> check<00:02:03.800> it

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
a ruler against the side and check it

screw here is the culprit

it's<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.260> screw<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.650> holds<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.100> fly<00:02:37.400> bar

cage into the head even if it comes

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.820 
cage into the head even if it comes
slightly<00:02:40.910> loose<00:02:41.330> you'll<00:02:41.780> find<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
slightly loose you'll find that the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.040 
slightly loose you'll find that the
tracking<00:02:43.250> will<00:02:43.580> be<00:02:43.730> wildly<00:02:44.209> out<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.720> just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
tracking will be wildly out and just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.660 
tracking will be wildly out and just
can't<00:02:45.290> give<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:47.180> true<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:48.549> just<00:02:49.549> had<00:02:49.640> a

can't give it to to true I just had a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.070 
can't give it to to true I just had a
problem<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.030> my<00:02:50.180> tracking<00:02:50.660> which<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.959> why

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
problem with my tracking which is why

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.870 
problem with my tracking which is why
I'm<00:02:51.170> making<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.530> video<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.580> was<00:02:52.700> actually

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
I'm making the video and it was actually

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.610 
I'm making the video and it was actually
the<00:02:53.150> last<00:02:53.360> thing<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.690> checked<00:02:54.019> which<00:02:54.230> was<00:02:54.380> him

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the last thing I checked which was him

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.729 
the last thing I checked which was him
and<00:02:54.890> he<00:02:55.760> was<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.910> problem<00:02:59.170> the<00:03:00.170> next<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.620> to

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
and he was the problem the next thing to

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.650 
and he was the problem the next thing to
check<00:03:00.799> if<00:03:01.130> you're<00:03:01.250> having<00:03:01.370> problems<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:02.330> have

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
check if you're having problems is have

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.870 
check if you're having problems is have
a<00:03:02.690> good<00:03:02.959> look<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.440> your<00:03:03.650> head<00:03:03.880> particularly

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
a good look in your head particularly

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.210 
a good look in your head particularly
around<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.540> health<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.470> plastic<00:03:06.860> links

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
around the health of the plastic links

this<00:03:07.549> one<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:07.880> particular<00:03:08.030> tends<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.930> get

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
this one in particular tends to get

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.930 
this one in particular tends to get
snapped<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.739> one<00:03:09.920> side<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.519> event<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.850> a

crash and that can cause some weird and

you're using a metal head like this
absolutely<00:03:30.470> use<00:03:30.860> something<00:03:31.280> like<00:03:31.570> lock<00:03:32.570> tight

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the next thing to check is the dampeners

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.490 
the next thing to check is the dampeners
these<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.750> rubber<00:03:45.750> o-rings<00:03:46.319> that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
feathering shaft and stop it from moving

feathering shaft and stop it from moving
too<00:03:55.200> wildly<00:03:56.060> you'll<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.270> if<00:03:57.390> they're

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
too wildly you'll know if they're

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.510 
too wildly you'll know if they're
starting<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.959> get<00:03:58.140> worn<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> look

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
starting to get worn because if you look

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.580 
starting to get worn because if you look
on<00:03:59.670> this<00:03:59.790> head<00:04:00.260> there's<00:04:01.260> hardly<00:04:01.620> no<00:04:02.010> no<00:04:03.590> play

it's<00:04:06.989> pretty<00:04:07.290> stiff<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.980> actually<00:04:08.760> use<00:04:09.180> t-rex

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
mistake is blade grip tightness you

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.450 
mistake is blade grip tightness you
should<00:05:07.539> have<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.840> blade<00:05:08.139> grips<00:05:08.560> tight<00:05:09.160> enough

should have the blade grips tight enough

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
so that they stay in place but loose

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.529 
so that they stay in place but loose
enough<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.490> if<00:05:12.729> you<00:05:12.880> put<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.150> blades<00:05:13.360> on

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
enough so that if you put the blades on

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.820 
enough so that if you put the blades on
the<00:05:13.660> side<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.050> shake<00:05:14.259> the<00:05:14.380> model

the side and shake the model

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.240 
the side and shake the model
they'll<00:05:15.430> troop<00:05:15.789> down<00:05:16.030> if<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.590> have<00:05:17.770> one<00:05:17.979> side

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
they'll troop down if you have one side

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.129 
they'll troop down if you have one side
tighter<00:05:18.639> than<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.000> other<00:05:19.030> then<00:05:19.660> it<00:05:19.780> can<00:05:19.960> move

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
tighter than the other then it can move

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.870 
tighter than the other then it can move
slightly<00:05:20.560> more<00:05:20.889> in<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.130> blade<00:05:21.370> grip<00:05:21.669> and

slightly more in the blade grip and

find is that each blade is although the

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
tolerances are very tight one might be

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.409 
tolerances are very tight one might be

will guarantee that the ride at the same

will guarantee that the ride at the same
height<00:06:07.210> you<00:06:07.810> just<00:06:07.840> have<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.349> adjust<00:06:08.500> one<00:06:09.930> the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
height you just have to adjust one the

height you just have to adjust one the
trick<00:06:11.199> to<00:06:11.409> use<00:06:11.650> is<00:06:11.949> to<00:06:12.639> mark<00:06:12.909> one<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.330> the

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
trick to use is to mark one of the

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.510 
trick to use is to mark one of the
blades<00:06:13.599> with<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.139> piece<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.409> tracking<00:06:14.889> tape<00:06:15.250> and

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
blades with a piece of tracking tape and

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.850 
blades with a piece of tracking tape and
then<00:06:16.060> as<00:06:16.210> you're<00:06:16.389> tracking<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:17.020> in<00:06:17.139> flight<00:06:17.470> is

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
then as you're tracking it in flight is

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.439 
then as you're tracking it in flight is
only<00:06:18.280> ever<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.820> adjust<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.930> link<00:06:20.289> in<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.740> head

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
only ever to adjust the link in the head

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
up to head height do it far enough away

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
along the line of the blades and you'll

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.490 
along the line of the blades and you'll
be<00:06:38.560> able<00:06:38.650> to<00:06:38.830> see<00:06:39.070> whether<00:06:39.280> they're<00:06:39.550> riding

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
be able to see whether they're riding

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.249 
be able to see whether they're riding
high<00:06:41.500> although<00:06:41.830> if<00:06:42.430> the<00:06:42.759> blue<00:06:43.030> blade<00:06:43.449> is<00:06:43.780> above

high although if the blue blade is above
the<00:06:44.440> other<00:06:44.590> blade<00:06:44.860> then<00:06:45.250> it's<00:06:45.580> got<00:06:45.759> too<00:06:45.940> much

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
the other blade then it's got too much

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.060 
the other blade then it's got too much
pitch<00:06:46.389> you<00:06:46.570> have<00:06:46.630> to<00:06:46.870> take<00:06:47.080> some<00:06:47.289> off<00:06:47.440> so

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
pitch you have to take some off so

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.980 
pitch you have to take some off so
you'll<00:06:48.400> have<00:06:48.639> to<00:06:48.820> shorten<00:06:49.449> the<00:06:49.840> link<00:06:50.110> if<00:06:50.590> it's

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
you'll have to shorten the link if it's

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.560 
you'll have to shorten the link if it's
riding<00:06:52.950> below<00:06:53.310> it<00:06:53.610> hasn't<00:06:53.970> got<00:06:54.060> enough<00:06:54.090> pitch

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
riding below it hasn't got enough pitch

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.420 
riding below it hasn't got enough pitch
you'll<00:06:55.110> have<00:06:55.320> to<00:06:55.470> slightly<00:06:55.710> the<00:06:55.950> lengthen<00:06:56.280> the

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
you'll have to slightly the lengthen the

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.570 
you'll have to slightly the lengthen the
link<00:06:56.640> in<00:06:57.270> this<00:06:58.170> head<00:06:58.530> I<00:06:58.740> actually<00:06:59.010> have<00:06:59.340> the

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
link in this head I actually have the

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.210 
link in this head I actually have the
titanium<00:07:00.120> turnbuckles<00:07:01.050> because<00:07:01.680> I<00:07:01.710> find<00:07:02.040> it

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
titanium turnbuckles because I find it

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.120 
titanium turnbuckles because I find it
gives<00:07:02.340> much<00:07:02.640> finer<00:07:02.970> control<00:07:03.240> for<00:07:04.110> tracking<00:07:07.130> so

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
gives much finer control for tracking so

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.110 
gives much finer control for tracking so
if<00:07:08.250> you<00:07:08.370> run<00:07:08.550> through<00:07:08.670> that<00:07:08.820> checklist

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
if you run through that checklist

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.880 
if you run through that checklist
hopefully<00:07:09.810> you<00:07:10.080> should<00:07:10.320> find<00:07:10.590> what<00:07:10.800> the

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
hopefully you should find what the

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.700 
hopefully you should find what the
problem<00:07:10.920> is<00:07:11.310> and<00:07:11.550> you<00:07:12.390> should<00:07:13.050> be<00:07:13.380> back<00:07:13.680> to

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
problem is and you should be back to

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.900 
problem is and you should be back to
perfect<00:07:14.340> tracking<00:07:14.580> hope<00:07:15.480> it<00:07:15.630> helps
