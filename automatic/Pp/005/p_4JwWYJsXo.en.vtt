00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 put not for this is precisely the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.320
 drummer's personal trainer with 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 this you can practice as per 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.689
 normal or loses or not 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 but at the same time you can also 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.640
 practice giving you time for each 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 exercise the time and minutes meant the bpm 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.129
 clearly the division to an extent 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 then by bit 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.920
 therefore he is your personal trainer 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 basically a volume this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.829
 let's say matrix where you can pull 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.149
 all out then turned off 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:06.299
 or the mode and the choice of the beat 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:10.950
 guard three quarters 45 78 years 5 octaves 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:17.280
 etc. and the possibility of rhythms e 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:21.930
 clearly the possibility of raising e 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 lower the bpm also a toe function 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.290
 and it is very, very interesting 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.329
 especially the question that can be 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.329
 apply this also to the auction
