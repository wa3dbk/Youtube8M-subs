00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.729
 they excel crime china so he is 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.420
 really very very very very bright 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.899

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.530

 worked his complexion and to have a beautiful 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.790
 ilike first just to mascara without 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.610
 line of eyeliner or with line 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.220
 eyeliner is super super super 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.900
 it's the pechoux and clip hold 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 who comes in a packaging like that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:37.710
 writer golden gloves while golden and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:43.220
 this is your highlighter side halter which 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.240
 is not easy to describe he is a little 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:54.510
 I am here I am no longer really for 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.890
 describe how the idea is super beautiful 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.420
 but you have to work 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.090
 as I would say like all 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.349
 markers because you do not have to 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.069
 forget that an email are products 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.260
 professional 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.689
 he is really a very very handsome he 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.760
 makes pinkish reflections golden reflections 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.980
 and suddenly it looks like an old rose 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.989
 and it is very very very beautiful 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.409
 go soft against it is hyper 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.870
 hyper hyper light and I find it 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.209
 would go well with one with a red to 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.799
 lips like that just the top of 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.799
 cheeky cheekbones on the bridge of the nose 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.769
 raised with sarpei super your purposes and the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.069
 upper part that you see there 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.069
 then they made the system is a 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.510
 other stuff 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.209
 this part that is a bit more 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:48.150
 clear he's right here that's it 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.409
 does this one too he's created word I 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.060
 would say they are not at all 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.709
 complementary as well as to doctors there 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.299
 will not have to put the other one unless 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.889
 you put yourself in the clearest one 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.340
 on darker blue eyes will have to 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.900
 swing 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.139
 it will not be necessary to put the two in the same 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.680
 where to mix them we will see this 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.180
 that gives 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.510
 he is very beautiful he is very beautiful ch'tis 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.549
 so mix the two I'm not too much 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.010
 sure it gave me 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.010
 to mix both is what it gives 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.070
 mix the two just he 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.220
 becomes a little clearer we feel 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.120
 much more this upper part 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.740
 when we mix them in this part 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.350
 this upper part that is right there 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.720
 and mix both of them that gives that so the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.250
 smaller is that one that's the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.590
 bigger is that that's it 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.020
 and the mixture and that gives that in 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.750
 to mix it just that one a little 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.250
 clearer yes he is very very handsome 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.890
 you can use them as well 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.800
 when the eye shadow can 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:05:02.810
 use as a bluff that plan there it is 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:07.210
 super nice that's what gives very very 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:12.950
 very it is very bright c1 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:18.710
 these opinions to the c1 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.990
 him that was my favorite of 7.7 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.730
 this collection knowing that I have no 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.670
 beach at all that looks like this 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.650
 I have Zionism and fashions but he 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.770
 is still a lot darker but 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.950
 even darker the super super super 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.360
 good it will go very well to makeup to 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.970
 black skins if you just want 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.400
 commented a little bit under all 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.170
 for sÃ¨te for this man is small 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.690
 glass it'll be great top with a red 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.360
 lipstick a bit of the same nude color 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.860
 his success is very much the goblin that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.680
 give you a first clear here is a 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.270
 boost it's very good then and at a 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.520
 other month block may I go 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.880
 use instead to actor on the edge 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.900
 of the nose 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.490

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.000
 right there I did not go down especially the 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.610
 everything because when I'm in the daytime 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.140
 you employers at home could not 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.490
 blush it looks like that with 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:16.970
 many have same sort of packaging there 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.830
 is super nice but too suffered there it's 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.890
 a bluff except for the pros casillas that 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.750

 drop well transform themselves and 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.780
 letter sent the light where is the 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.660
 difference between her and there that between the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.600
 and there it brings a lot gained a lot 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:59.760
