 I have been living alone since April, but my apartment had a built-in refrigerator 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.190
 I use it 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:30.760
 However, the refrigerator is a small one as in a hotel room, and it is about drinks and seasoning 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:36.670
 We changed into a large refrigerator recently without entering 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:40.340
 It will be delivered soon so I will bring it to the university, make a lunch box, call my friends home and eat together.
