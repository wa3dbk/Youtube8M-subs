brush like this this one's from morphe

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.410 
brush like this this one's from morphe
and<00:01:44.439> it's<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.830> an<00:01:44.979> angled<00:01:45.460> brush<00:01:45.460> that's<00:01:46.090> not

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
and it's just an angled brush that's not

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.590 
and it's just an angled brush that's not
as<00:01:46.720> harsh<00:01:47.500> as<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.860> contour<00:01:48.520> brush<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.090> i<00:01:49.540> took

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
as harsh as a contour brush and i took

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.480 
as harsh as a contour brush and i took
this<00:01:50.140> powder<00:01:50.439> right<00:01:50.740> here<00:01:51.070> which<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.340> the

general<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.459> think<00:03:01.489> we're<00:03:02.000> really<00:03:02.180> easy<00:03:02.540> for<00:03:02.870> me

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
general I think we're really easy for me

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.370 
general I think we're really easy for me
to<00:03:03.020> use<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:05.030> no<00:03:05.450> complaints<00:03:05.720> about<00:03:06.080> it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
to use and I have no complaints about it

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.140 
to use and I have no complaints about it
so<00:03:06.500> although<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.190> just<00:03:07.489> ten<00:03:07.760> dollars

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
so although this is just ten dollars

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.420 
so although this is just ten dollars
less<00:03:08.360> than<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.660> Anasazi<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.320> contour<00:03:09.800> kit<00:03:10.010> it

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
less than the Anasazi a contour kit it

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940 
less than the Anasazi a contour kit it
may<00:03:10.940> be<00:03:11.000> worth<00:03:11.360> just<00:03:11.390> picking<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.440> up<00:03:12.500> I

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
may be worth just picking this one up I

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.699 
may be worth just picking this one up I
also<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.790> course<00:03:14.150> don't<00:03:14.570> have<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.080> Anastasio

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
also of course don't have the Anastasio

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.250 
also of course don't have the Anastasio
one<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.160> i<00:03:16.190> can't<00:03:16.519> really<00:03:16.700> compare<00:03:17.420> them<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
one so i can't really compare them the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.470 
one so i can't really compare them the
Anastasio<00:03:18.769> one<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.250> may<00:03:19.459> blow<00:03:20.000> people<00:03:20.390> away

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
Anastasio one just may blow people away

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.870 
Anastasio one just may blow people away
and<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.230> might<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.470> 10<00:03:22.280> times<00:03:22.519> better<00:03:22.730> than
