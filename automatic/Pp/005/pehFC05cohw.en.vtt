I saw it I looked at it and I was really
impressed<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.659> simplicity<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.470> how

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
direct and how easy it represents the

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.509 
direct and how easy it represents the
triangle<00:00:42.839> of<00:00:42.899> exposure<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.890> relationship

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
triangle of exposure the relationship

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.119 
triangle of exposure the relationship
between<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.420> shutter<00:00:45.989> speed<00:00:46.170> aperture<00:00:46.769> and

between the shutter speed aperture and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
between the shutter speed aperture and
ISO<00:00:47.360> my<00:00:48.360> suggestion<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.589> look<00:00:49.800> if

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

has 104 thousand shares and I felt the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.760 
has 104 thousand shares and I felt the
need<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> share<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.030> immediately<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.659> the

moment I shared other people have have
shared<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.700> top<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
shared it as well so on the top on the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
shared it as well so on the top on the
top<00:01:37.080> row<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.310> relationship

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
top row you will see the relationship

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800 
top row you will see the relationship
between<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.530> aperture<00:01:41.040> F<00:01:41.250> 1.4<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.570> will<00:01:42.690> see

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
between the aperture F 1.4 you will see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
between the aperture F 1.4 you will see
a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> blur<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> background<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.430> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a lot of blur in the background in this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.289 
a lot of blur in the background in this
small<00:01:45.270> diagram<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.520> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.760> right<00:01:47.940> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
small diagram and going to the right the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.570 
small diagram and going to the right the
aperture<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.990> decreasing<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.979> size<00:01:50.010> it

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
aperture is decreasing in size it

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.600 
aperture is decreasing in size it
increases<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> number<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.610> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
increases in the number and the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
increases in the number and the
background<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.659> popping<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.010> more

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
background is popping up more and more

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.070 
background is popping up more and more
clear<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.450> basically<00:01:57.900> the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
clear so this is basically the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.109 
clear so this is basically the
relationship<00:01:58.650> between<00:01:58.860> aperture<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.580> depth

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
relationship between aperture and depth

you want to capture really fast action

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.119 
you want to capture really fast action
you<00:02:27.900> need<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.139> go<00:02:28.290> five<00:02:28.590> hundredth<00:02:28.919> of<00:02:29.010> a

I<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:32.160> believe<00:02:32.370> people<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.730> actually<00:02:33.030> hold

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I don't believe people can actually hold

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the camera manually on a 60s of a second

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
the camera manually on a 60s of a second
so<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> do<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.590> recommend<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.069> shutter<00:02:38.760> speed

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so I do not recommend that shutter speed

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.300 
so I do not recommend that shutter speed
and<00:02:39.300> if<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.989> go<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.170> you'll<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.800> di<00:02:40.950> so

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
and if you go down you'll see di so

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.210

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260

eight<00:02:46.500> hundred<00:02:47.040> probably<00:02:47.849> sixteen<00:02:48.480> hundred

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
eight hundred probably sixteen hundred

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.570 
eight hundred probably sixteen hundred
for<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> good<00:02:49.170> camera<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:50.010> still<00:02:50.250> okay

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
for a good camera it's still okay

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.259 
for a good camera it's still okay
whatever<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.599> above<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.110> three<00:02:52.650> thousand

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
whatever it's above a three thousand

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.800 
whatever it's above a three thousand
it's<00:02:54.269> an<00:02:54.569> unusable<00:02:55.349> any<00:02:55.620> longer<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.810> my

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it's an unusable any longer so my

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's an unusable any longer so my
suggestion<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.190> picture<00:02:59.459> printed

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
suggestion take this picture printed

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.699 
suggestion take this picture printed
yourself<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.690> laminated<00:03:00.989> have<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.620> in

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
yourself have it laminated have it in

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.890 
yourself have it laminated have it in
your<00:03:01.830> pocket<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.459> try<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> play<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:03.720> your

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
your pocket and try to play with your

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
your pocket and try to play with your
camera<00:03:04.230> settings<00:03:04.440> until<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> understand<00:03:05.819> I

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
camera settings until you understand I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.880 
camera settings until you understand I
believe<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.900> by<00:03:07.230> far<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> best

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
believe this is by far the best

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
believe this is by far the best
representation<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.090> exposure<00:03:09.510> triangle

representation of the exposure triangle

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.009

and<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.519> basically<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.209> entire<00:03:12.600> course

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
and this is basically an entire course

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.110 
and this is basically an entire course
we<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.650> talk<00:03:13.890> for<00:03:14.190> hours<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.850> hours<00:03:15.090> about

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
we can talk for hours and hours about

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.509 
we can talk for hours and hours about
each<00:03:15.540> individual<00:03:16.170> settings<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.099> each

each individual settings and each

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.240 
each individual settings and each
individual<00:03:18.209> value<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.040> best

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
individual value but this is the best

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
individual value but this is the best
representation<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.989> camera<00:03:22.290> settings

ever<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.410> my<00:03:25.650> opinion<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.519> it's<00:03:26.700> one<00:03:26.880> course

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230
