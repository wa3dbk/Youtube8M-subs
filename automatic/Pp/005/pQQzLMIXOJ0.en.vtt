is the first version they're up to like
1.5<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> review<00:00:41.579> that

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
1.5 and I'm going to review that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610 
1.5 and I'm going to review that
separately<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> wanted<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> cover<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
separately but I wanted to cover this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.470 
separately but I wanted to cover this
and<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.040> talk<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.300> this

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and just talk about you know where this

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.119 
and just talk about you know where this
started<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.469> highlight<00:00:46.649> some<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
started and to highlight some of the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.880 
started and to highlight some of the
differences<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.910> starting<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.379> gears<00:00:49.680> on

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
differences so starting out the gears on

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.290 
differences so starting out the gears on
this<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.610> continuously

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
this it's actually a continuously

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
this it's actually a continuously
variable<00:00:51.780> transmission<00:00:52.440> by<00:00:52.590> NuVinci

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.639 
variable transmission by NuVinci
you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.820> shift<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.270> standstill<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you can shift at standstill you see that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.549 
you can shift at standstill you see that
little<00:00:55.890> guy<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
little guy that it's more it's like a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
little guy that it's more it's like a
steeper<00:00:58.980> hill<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> flatter<00:00:59.850> surface<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
steeper hill or a flatter surface and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.700 
steeper hill or a flatter surface and
that's<00:01:00.539> sort<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.989> changes<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that's sort of what changes the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's sort of what changes the
resistance<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> lower<00:01:02.760> gear<00:01:03.030> versus<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
resistance like a lower gear versus a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
resistance like a lower gear versus a
higher<00:01:03.690> gear<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:04.890> cool<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
higher gear and that's pretty cool it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.789 
higher gear and that's pretty cool it's
really<00:01:05.309> smooth<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.540> located<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
really smooth and it's located in the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
really smooth and it's located in the
rear<00:01:08.240> wheel<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.750> again<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
rear wheel back here again there's the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.370 
rear wheel back here again there's the
there's<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> new<00:01:11.490> Vinci<00:01:11.909> hub<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> you've<00:01:13.200> got

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
there's the new Vinci hub and you've got

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.190 
there's the new Vinci hub and you've got
a<00:01:13.590> chain<00:01:14.189> pulling<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> were

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
a chain pulling that just as if you were

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
a chain pulling that just as if you were
you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.799> bicycle<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.790> pulling<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you know a bicycle you're pulling that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.260 
you know a bicycle you're pulling that
as<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.080> ride<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.979> does<00:01:20.159> free<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.119> on

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
as you ride and it does free will now on

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
as you ride and it does free will now on
the<00:01:21.390> other<00:01:21.570> side<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.409> chain<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.979> connected

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the other side this chain is connected

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
the other side this chain is connected
to<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.880> six<00:01:24.390> hundred<00:01:24.450> watt<00:01:24.840> geared<00:01:25.590> hub

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to that six hundred watt geared hub

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
to that six hundred watt geared hub
motor<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.330> sort<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.689> mid<00:01:27.990> drive<00:01:28.259> hub

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
motor but it's sort of a mid drive hub

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
motor but it's sort of a mid drive hub
motor<00:01:28.799> setup<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
motor setup because as you can see it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.359 
motor setup because as you can see it's
not<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> hub<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
not in the hub and what that does is

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
not in the hub and what that does is
actually<00:01:32.970> allows<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> step<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
actually allows them to step it up and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
actually allows them to step it up and
sort<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> increase<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> torque<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
sort of increase the torque that this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
sort of increase the torque that this
thing<00:01:36.450> offers<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.400> battery<00:01:38.579> pack

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
thing offers so that's the battery pack

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630 
thing offers so that's the battery pack
right<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.689> 48<00:01:40.290> volt<00:01:40.320> 10<00:01:41.189> amp<00:01:41.430> hour

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
right there it's a 48 volt 10 amp hour
