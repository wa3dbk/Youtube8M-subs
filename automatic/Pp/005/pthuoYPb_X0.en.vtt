00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 In Galapagos you can easily see the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.739
 dependence that each animal has with 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 the species that share their territory 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.059
 but among all of them beyond the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.269
 borders that mark each of the 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:32.780
 islands there is a binding link a support 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.079
 lifelong common life in Galapagos 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.079
 the sea 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.350
 under the waters that bathe the archipelago 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 of galapagos are hiding infinity of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.170
 habitats and they teem life 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.930
 unlike the islands are systems 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.750
 open where many of the species 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.830
 can go from one to the other without any 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.830
 physical limitation 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.520
 and this natural wealth is due to the 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.500
 particular conditions that the ocean 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.930
 pacific finds in the area of 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.120
 Galapagos where the trade winds and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.730
 the ocean currents combine 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.730
 creating an annual cycle of gentle changes 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.439
 from the south come the cold waters of the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.689
 current of the west peru 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.850
 the equatorial current of cromwell and 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.810
 from the north with more temperate waters the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 panama stream 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.330
 of the sea should probably have arrived 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.540
 the first penguins from the sounds 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.910
 lands of the South American cone of beauty 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.640
 humbolt and magellan penguins derived 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.160
 the Galapagos penguin the only one of the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.680
 18 species of penguins that appear at 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.610
 north of ecuador and that entirely nests 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.610
 in the tropics 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.920
 the richness of the cold waters of 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.740
 Galapagos was the key to the origin and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.420
 survival of this penguin with the 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.270
 contribution of the frozen waters of the south 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.330
 come the microscopic nutrients and 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.580
 after them the entire trophic chain a 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.270
 vital chain that ends beyond the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.270
 waters of the sea 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.680
 sea lions are the mammals most 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.840
 common in the Galapagos 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.439
 the floating islands that they brought to the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.359
 reptiles just transported mammals 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.310
 without water available the two weeks that 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.530
 it would take a raft to drift from the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.659
 continent until these islands were 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.780
 too much time for most of 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.909
 mammals could survive but 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.109
 the sea lions did not arrive in rafts 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.109
 if not swimming 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.540
 More than 50,000 individuals live in the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.359
 area of ​​the archipelago feeding 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.310
 mainly fish an effort 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.560
 barely significant for the rich 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.970
 waters that benefit from the conjunction 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.970
 of different currents 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.689
 inside the Galapagos there are two 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.909
 species a the fur wolf came from 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.610
 the cold waters of the south the same waters 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.619
 of which the penguin arrived is the most 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.779
 small of the two and is related to 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.079
 the fur seal wolves that still inhabit the 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.699
 waters and coasts of the South American cone 

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:59.159
 but the most numerous is his relative 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.709
 close the sea lion of the Galapagos 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.929
 whose first individuals must have 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.539
 arrive from the northern hemisphere of the waters 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:08.459
 california coastal and faithful to their 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:13.009
 origins is not unusual to find them 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:13.009
 enjoying a good day of surfing 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.720
 no longer 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.960
 and 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.199
 everyone 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.290
