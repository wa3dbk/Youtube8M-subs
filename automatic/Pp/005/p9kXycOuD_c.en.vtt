 He gathered a large part of the workers 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.810
 from the eastern zone the idea arises in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 an internal communication course where 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.739
 they start talking about the possibilities or 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 of what could be done so that the 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.210
 people feel more integrated into the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.920
 company 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.790
 and in one of the ideas that they contribute is 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.250
 this the experience that leads by its 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.769

 a good time to do it again 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.769

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.650
 They arranged four large barbecues 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.650
 where the assistants could prepare 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.210

 Delegations has been a very day 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.690
 rewarding because we have been able to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.850
 share a barbecue with the various 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 colleagues from other departments 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.870
 This year, the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.150
 delegations of valencia alicante and 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 almerÃ­a with the intention that the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 encounter serves to reinforce ties 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.540
 between the different geographical areas 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.540
 where to review has presence 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.190
 the truth that for those of us who are here 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.920
 a lot of time is to be grateful that a 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.560
 company like this, then join the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 people who are in different provinces and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.610
 The truth is that we are going through it very 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.290
 well and more with our family and little 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.790
 grace and few entrepreneurs usually do 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.130
 I think that the most important thing is the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.080
 type of meetings the approach between 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.620
 workers 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.410
 and I said let's break the ice a bit and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.350
 we enjoyed especially enjoy 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.170
 more than 70 children attended the day of the 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.930
 families in the company of their parents as 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.640
 already happened last year the youngest 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.360
 they had an attraction where 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.430
 they could play and have fun 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.870
 Hi, I'm a victory and I think what 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.870
 The details are important 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.430
