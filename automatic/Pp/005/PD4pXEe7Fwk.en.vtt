00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
we're going to cut some wood with the

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.080 
we're going to cut some wood with the
evo<00:00:13.059> and<00:00:13.860> show<00:00:14.860> you<00:00:14.950> guys<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.759> brief<00:00:15.910> shelf

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
basically it looks like a route that's

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.580 
basically it looks like a route that's
come<00:00:22.360> up<00:00:22.390> and<00:00:23.399> grown<00:00:24.399> over<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.480> ground<00:00:25.750> and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
come up and grown over the ground and

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.549 
come up and grown over the ground and
it's<00:00:27.489> pretty<00:00:27.700> strong<00:00:28.079> show<00:00:29.079> them<00:00:29.230> how<00:00:29.320> strong

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:29.559 
it's pretty strong show them how strong

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.530 
it's pretty strong show them how strong
this<00:00:29.739> thing<00:00:29.980> is<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.910> it's<00:00:31.059> pretty<00:00:31.210> sturdy

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
this thing is so it's pretty sturdy

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.690 
this thing is so it's pretty sturdy
we're<00:00:32.349> going<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> use<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.130> is<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.370> doorway

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
we're going to use is this is a doorway

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.660 
we're going to use is this is a doorway
we're<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.540> lay<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> lean-to<00:00:35.380> piece<00:00:35.860> we're

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
we're going to lay a lean-to piece we're

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.950 
we're going to lay a lean-to piece we're
clearing<00:00:36.940> all<00:00:37.150> this<00:00:37.300> snow<00:00:37.570> out<00:00:37.780> of<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.900> way

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
clearing all this snow out of the way

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.980 
clearing all this snow out of the way
for<00:00:38.110> ground<00:00:39.060> so<00:00:40.060> we<00:00:40.150> got<00:00:40.300> some<00:00:40.480> good<00:00:40.630> insula

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
for ground so we got some good insula

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.690 
for ground so we got some good insula
and<00:00:41.260> want<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.770> insulate<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.160> ground<00:00:42.340> as<00:00:42.490> much

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
and want to insulate the ground as much

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.720 
and want to insulate the ground as much
so<00:00:42.910> get<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.270> snow<00:00:43.480> out<00:00:43.510> of<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.720> way<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:45.580> then

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
so get the snow out of the way and then

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.730 
so get the snow out of the way and then
we'll<00:00:45.880> lay<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.380> crosspiece<00:00:47.380> and<00:00:47.650> then<00:00:48.220> the

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
we'll lay the crosspiece and then the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.960 
we'll lay the crosspiece and then the
start<00:00:50.740> laying<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.160> sides<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.820> can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
start laying in the sides and you can

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.670 
start laying in the sides and you can
see<00:00:55.090> it's<00:00:55.270> not<00:00:55.420> on<00:00:55.570> top<00:00:55.810> of<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:55.989> hill<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.560> on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
see it's not on top of the hill it's on

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.080 
see it's not on top of the hill it's on
the<00:00:56.710> side<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.220> hill<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.730> downward

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
sloping side and yeah we're in a pretty

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.859 
sloping side and yeah we're in a pretty
heavy<00:01:02.710> forest<00:01:03.070> area<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.420> there's<00:01:04.570> not<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.720> lot

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
heavy forest area so there's not a lot

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.420 
heavy forest area so there's not a lot
of<00:01:04.899> wind<00:01:05.229> in<00:01:05.409> here<00:01:05.619> which<00:01:05.770> will<00:01:06.009> make<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.340> a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
of wind in here which will make it a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.240 
of wind in here which will make it a
great<00:01:06.909> great<00:01:07.479> sleep<00:01:07.810> area<00:01:08.079> okay<00:01:08.439> gang<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:09.100> can

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
kind of see how we kick out this snow

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.240 
kind of see how we kick out this snow
this<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.650> a<00:01:11.680> crossbar<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.450> entrance<00:01:13.870> way

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this is a crossbar the entrance way

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.500 
this is a crossbar the entrance way
we're<00:01:15.250> going<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.400> do<00:01:15.490> some<00:01:15.520> improvement<00:01:16.420> here

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
we're going to do some improvement here

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.760 
we're going to do some improvement here
and<00:01:16.690> then<00:01:16.780> welcome<00:01:17.050> back<00:01:17.229> starts<00:01:17.620> to<00:01:17.650> take

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
we can lay in an insulator and then

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.810 
we can lay in an insulator and then
we're<00:01:26.650> gonna<00:01:26.770> start<00:01:27.040> building<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> song<00:01:27.610> guys

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
as you can see this is starting to

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.670 
as you can see this is starting to
progress<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.410> look<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.950> something<00:01:57.620> what<00:01:58.620> do

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
progress and look like something what do

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.500 
progress and look like something what do
you<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.800> scalp<00:01:59.190> enter<00:01:59.490> I<00:02:00.290> think<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.380> cold

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
you think scalp enter I think it's cold

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.870 
you think scalp enter I think it's cold
it'll<00:02:03.510> be<00:02:03.600> warm<00:02:03.840> tonight<00:02:03.990> man<00:02:06.080> hopefully<00:02:07.880> ok

it'll be warm tonight man hopefully ok

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.530 
it'll be warm tonight man hopefully ok
guys<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.990> starting<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.380> look<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:11.540> terd

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
guys it's starting to look like a terd

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.850 
guys it's starting to look like a terd
in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> forest<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.440> guess<00:02:15.200> anyway<00:02:16.200> it's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
