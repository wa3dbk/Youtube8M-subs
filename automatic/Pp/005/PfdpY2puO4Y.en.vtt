00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:26.610
 skinny they brought 100 kilos of fleas that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.900
 they were heading to the street that maybe I 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.450

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.950

 our props 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.820
 this one that we occupy within our show 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 like cameras like things from 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 of the show my little ratita 22 years already of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.460
 to represent my character pildorín 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.260
 by chaparro I say yes for short 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.610
 I believe that I do by shower action 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.350
 gmexico later they made me many 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.940
 evil and I was little I say 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.479
 that we all have a man to whom 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.860
 those of us who dedicate ourselves to this type of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.540
 environment we have as a gift not 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.060
 we have like that spark or 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.700
 speak or have no pity against 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.500
 people or even with family 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.660
 thrown a bit of chatter then I 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.010
 I say that when you have a gift you do not have 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.010
 to go developing is little bit 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.560
 of not being fat has gone from good 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.670
 if that little belly he has has not given him 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 high benefits 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.659
 have for that ecological shade gives him his 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 birdie 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.729
 I am very strict in my work 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.770
 I am very very very explosive without makeup 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.100
 with make-up as we change 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.060
 but chairs without makeup if we are very 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.640
 very different if two children a year have 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.590
 my boy agreed and eight years this has the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.289
 breath that also sometimes in help 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.829
 with me is hyung pillion I think we've 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.399
 known how to handle our work 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.970
 or how to perform our work 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.220
 Thanks to all this because we have what 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.920
 we have our work good I 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.980
 I went to Mexico this I worked in the street 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.470
 this I come from the little valley of the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 street of the micros in the park makes in 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.579
 the cold traffic light find the people 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.739
 that were orienting me how to grow 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.590
 how to grow clear there are good and bad 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.750
 but I think I found those people 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.530
 indicated if sleeping on the street 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.830
 is to ask for money in the cars 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.830
 shops are not improved to ask for a 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.990
 taco or something like that if I come from a family 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.850
 very numerous and very distorted me 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.860
 very separate distortion where there was not 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.510
 much love much much heat from home 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.300
 then it was a lot like that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.600
 I deposited 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.910
 and my mom also worked like that was 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.520
 merchant and this and we all work 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.240

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.240
 United family 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.620

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.620

 life is many many good things 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.270
 bad only you decide where 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.540
 You want to be clear that I also had my 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.630
 detours and everything but but we go back to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.370

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.129

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.310
 I have found my wife since we 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.590

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.570
 age like that small 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.570
