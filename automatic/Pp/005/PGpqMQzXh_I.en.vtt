gonna be pulling and tugging or it could

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
gonna be pulling and tugging or it could
just<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.439> loosened<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.729> could<00:01:23.880> take

just be loosened up and you could take
it<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.840> why<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> went

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it right out that's why I went

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350 
it right out that's why I went
professionally<00:01:26.130> none<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.670> skin<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.090> still

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
professionally none of my skin was still

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080 
professionally none of my skin was still
around<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.020> cuz<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.619> ripped<00:01:28.950> right<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.280> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
around it cuz it got ripped right out so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
around it cuz it got ripped right out so
it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.659> needing<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.650> bit

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it was just needing to be a little bit

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
it was just needing to be a little bit
pushed<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> guess<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> didn't<00:01:33.780> hurt<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
pushed out I guess it didn't hurt and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
pushed out I guess it didn't hurt and
removing<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> didn't<00:01:35.340> hurt<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.610> well<00:01:35.640> what

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
removing it didn't hurt as well what

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120

hurt<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.540> after<00:01:36.960> she<00:01:36.990> removed<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> she<00:01:37.860> needed

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
