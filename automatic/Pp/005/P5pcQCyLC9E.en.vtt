okay<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.230> part<00:00:01.589> 2<00:00:01.860> of<00:00:02.159> solving<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.639> Rubik's

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay this is part 2 of solving a Rubik's

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay this is part 2 of solving a Rubik's
Cube<00:00:03.290> and<00:00:04.290> let's<00:00:04.770> begin<00:00:05.100> we<00:00:05.609> should<00:00:05.850> already

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
Cube and let's begin we should already

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.990 
Cube and let's begin we should already
have<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:07.259> solid<00:00:09.170> color<00:00:10.190> layer<00:00:11.190> for<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> bottom

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
have a solid color layer for the bottom

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.589 
have a solid color layer for the bottom
layer<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.420> solid<00:00:13.340> the<00:00:14.340> whole<00:00:14.370> thing<00:00:15.179> or<00:00:15.420> we're

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
layer and solid the whole thing or we're

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.160 
layer and solid the whole thing or we're
white<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:17.460> put<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> white<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.449> bottom<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
white so put the white on the bottom and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.370 
white so put the white on the bottom and
that's<00:00:19.289> sir<00:00:19.529> look<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> top<00:00:20.900> look<00:00:21.900> for

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that's sir look at the top look for

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.310 
that's sir look at the top look for
colors<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.250> aren't<00:00:23.850> yellow<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.019> can't

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
colors that aren't yellow so you can't

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.300 
colors that aren't yellow so you can't
use<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.699> cross<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.439> can't<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:28.949> this

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
use in that cross so we can't use this

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.330 
use in that cross so we can't use this
one<00:00:29.580> or<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.880> one

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
one or this one

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
one or this one
and<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.450> ones<00:00:34.670> cuz<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:36.270> they

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and we can use these ones cuz we they

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.270 
and we can use these ones cuz we they
don't<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:36.960> Hill<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> top<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
don't have Hill on the top or on the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.020 
don't have Hill on the top or on the
sides<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> let's<00:00:40.649> use<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.190> match<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
sides so let's use this one match that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.720 
sides so let's use this one match that
up<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> red<00:00:42.840> cuz<00:00:43.320> ya<00:00:43.739> date<00:00:44.309> authorities

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
up with the red cuz ya date authorities

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.459 
up with the red cuz ya date authorities
look<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> top<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:45.989> green

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
look on the top that's green

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.369 
look on the top that's green
click<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.309> both<00:00:47.489> sides<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.270> part<00:00:49.140> has

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
click on both sides to see what part has

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
click on both sides to see what part has
the<00:00:49.410> green<00:00:49.680> Center<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the green Center this one so we want to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.639 
the green Center this one so we want to
move<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.590> green<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.410> layer

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
move that green or move the top layer

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.170 
move that green or move the top layer
away<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> green<00:00:56.550> center<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.050> move

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
away from the green center and then move

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920 
away from the green center and then move
right<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.680> top<00:01:02.250> counterclockwise<00:01:03.210> or

you find a white one again match what
kind<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.409> sign<00:01:10.619> matching<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> green

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
kind of sign matching with the green

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
a green one to the second layer okay

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
a green one to the second layer okay
look<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> top<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.950> two

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
look on the top you can use these two

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.179 
look on the top you can use these two
cuz<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> cross<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.229> yeah<00:01:31.799> check<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
cuz it's in the cross but yeah check the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.149 
cuz it's in the cross but yeah check the
sides<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.729> can't<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
sides I can't use this one because it

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.609
