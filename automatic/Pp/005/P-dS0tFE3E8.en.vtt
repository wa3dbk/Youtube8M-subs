the perfect song to sit in the park and

the perfect song to sit in the park and
listen<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.630> is<00:01:17.289> amazingly<00:01:17.829> peaceful<00:01:18.430> if

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060

you<00:01:19.240> really<00:01:19.539> pay<00:01:19.720> attention<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.679> can<00:01:20.890> notice

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
you really pay attention you can notice

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.160 
you really pay attention you can notice
how<00:01:21.340> simple<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> tune<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.240> but<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.780> think

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
how simple the tune is but I think

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.980 
how simple the tune is but I think
that's<00:01:23.500> why<00:01:23.799> this<00:01:23.860> song<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.429> so<00:01:24.610> great<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.750> felt

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
that's why this song is so great it felt

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.539 
that's why this song is so great it felt
like<00:01:26.229> some<00:01:26.470> guy<00:01:26.679> was<00:01:26.860> following<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.369> around

stroll<00:01:30.520> through<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.909> park

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
stroll through the park

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.960 
stroll through the park
many<00:01:32.289> people<00:01:32.710> who<00:01:32.799> played<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.189> original<00:01:33.280> gold

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
many people who played the original gold

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.880 
many people who played the original gold
silver<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:34.479> crystal<00:01:34.630> first<00:01:35.079> preferred<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
silver and crystal first preferred the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.309 
silver and crystal first preferred the
original<00:01:36.360> normally<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.569> would<00:01:37.899> consider<00:01:38.200> it

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
original normally I would consider it

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.190 
original normally I would consider it
completely<00:01:39.039> based<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.490> nostalgia<00:01:39.940> but<00:01:40.810> take<00:01:41.170> a

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
completely based on nostalgia but take a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
completely based on nostalgia but take a
listen<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:41.799> maybe<00:01:41.979> you'll<00:01:42.159> understand<00:01:42.610> why

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.540 

after<00:02:23.110> listening<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.770> original<00:02:24.220> track

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
after listening to the original track

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.910 
after listening to the original track
you<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.180> understand<00:02:25.720> why<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.990> whole<00:02:26.380> retro

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
you can understand why the whole retro

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.010 
you can understand why the whole retro
8-bit<00:02:27.190> sound<00:02:27.610> actually<00:02:28.180> complements<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
8-bit sound actually complements the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.950 
8-bit sound actually complements the
tune<00:02:29.230> very<00:02:29.620> well<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:31.000> me<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.300> feels<00:02:31.480> nostalgic

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
tune very well to me it feels nostalgic

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.050

and<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.680> didn't<00:02:32.980> even<00:02:33.070> go<00:02:33.310> all<00:02:33.490> playing<00:02:33.760> gold

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and I didn't even go all playing gold

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.240 
and I didn't even go all playing gold
silver<00:02:34.390> or<00:02:34.510> crystal<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.050> believe<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.040> may<00:02:36.190> be

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
silver or crystal I believe that may be

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.550 
silver or crystal I believe that may be
equal<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> remake<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.810> got<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.230> say<00:02:38.410> how
