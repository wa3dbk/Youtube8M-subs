00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:10.560
 well we already have all the music 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:16.940
 held open tongue always 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.940
 and now we spend the day and what 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:25.150
 and this is so bad has to be there 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.619
 well let's see here the numbering we have 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.230
 a numbering in which that drawing of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.650
 waves has a line that's when it 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.930
 works with the simple fracture and the other 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.059
 that has double the when you work with 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.710
 the supplements for that are the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.460
 numbers with which now that I'm going to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.590
 work with the machine alone I come 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.050
 to the hondita that is scratched a single 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.079
 time in this case I will work with a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 attention 6 personality or type 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.440
 baby of almost million or commonly called 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.469
 technically and side 3 16 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.480
 well these red buttons have to 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.049
 be up and these targets towards 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.049
 ahead 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.620
 I will 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 to make the first pass remember this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.880
 the first lake with small blows 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 slowly for being the first 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.469
 of this one it happened of the first one and already it is 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.469
 I follow 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 I'm going to remember to take out 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.399
 this crime that I put at the beginning if not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.399
 I have one hour left 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.360
 I'm working with tension 6 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.730
 perfectly calibrated well let's 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 make a different dot for example 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.600
 attention 4 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:13.750
 I'm going to attention 10 12 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.290
 Goya 4 is a vanilla point or 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 let say 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.720
 I'm going to 10 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
 and I go back to 4 and we see a little dot 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.010
 for this point he will have heard 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.090
 let's 6 that it would be a sealed without wool 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.090
 well, we count
