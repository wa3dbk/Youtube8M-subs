Eastern backhand grip well unfortunately

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.319 
Eastern backhand grip well unfortunately
when<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> player<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.219> using<00:00:38.610> eastern<00:00:38.940> backhand

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
when a player is using eastern backhand

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
when a player is using eastern backhand
grip<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.719> turn<00:00:39.930> sideways<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.980> takes<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
grip and they turn sideways it takes a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
grip and they turn sideways it takes a
racket<00:00:41.969> too<00:00:42.120> far<00:00:42.390> back<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
racket too far back so then they have to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
racket too far back so then they have to
swing<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.969> hit<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> ball<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.420> puts<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
swing to hit the ball this puts a lot of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
swing to hit the ball this puts a lot of
strain<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> elbow<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> eastern

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
strain on the elbow in the eastern

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
strain on the elbow in the eastern
backhand<00:00:47.550> grip<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> volley<00:00:48.270> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
backhand grip on the volley it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
backhand grip on the volley it's
probably<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> leading<00:00:49.980> causes<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
probably one of the leading causes of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
probably one of the leading causes of
tennis<00:00:50.940> elbow<00:00:51.410> what<00:00:52.410> you'll<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> skilled

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
tennis elbow what you'll see is skilled

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
tennis elbow what you'll see is skilled
players<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.120> use<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> continental<00:00:55.410> grip<00:00:55.590> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
players do is use a continental grip and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.260 
players do is use a continental grip and
simply<00:00:56.190> turn<00:00:56.399> sideways

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
simply turn sideways

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
simply turn sideways
this<00:00:57.570> sets<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> racket<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.800> target<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
this sets the racket to the target in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
this sets the racket to the target in
almost<00:00:59.579> every<00:00:59.910> situation<00:01:00.629> whether<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.379> an

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
almost every situation whether it be an

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
almost every situation whether it be an
angle<00:01:01.920> volley<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.489> default<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.149> all

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
angle volley or a default it's all

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
angle volley or a default it's all
determined<00:01:03.809> based<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.860> how<00:01:05.129> much<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> player

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
determined based on how much the player

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
determined based on how much the player
turns<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.720> by<00:01:06.930> doing<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> racquet<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
turns but by doing this the racquet is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.399 
turns but by doing this the racquet is
set<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> angle<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> player

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
set to the angle and now all the player

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
set to the angle and now all the player
has<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> keep<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> fairly<00:01:11.820> strong

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just one finger to show it's not a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
just one finger to show it's not a
strength<00:01:21.540> issue<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.590> need<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:22.920> whole

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
strength issue we don't need our whole

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
strength issue we don't need our whole
hand<00:01:23.729> behind<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> racket<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> hit<00:01:24.960> at

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
hand behind the racket the hit at

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
hand behind the racket the hit at
Eastern<00:01:25.409> earn<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.890> hit<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> backhand<00:01:26.700> we

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
Eastern earn it to hit the backhand we

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.240 
Eastern earn it to hit the backhand we
don't<00:01:27.180> need<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.420> Eastern<00:01:27.750> grip<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
don't need an Eastern grip to do that so

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
don't need an Eastern grip to do that so
it's<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> strength<00:01:30.329> issue<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> player

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it's not a strength issue when a player

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.649 
it's not a strength issue when a player
turns<00:01:31.530> sideways<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.700> simply<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> meet

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
turns sideways they simply need to meet

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
turns sideways they simply need to meet
the<00:01:33.810> ball<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> slice<00:01:34.710> through<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> ball<00:01:35.340> and

hold their finish and if they do that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
hold their finish and if they do that
they're<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.400> clean<00:01:38.759> ball

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490

they're going to have a very clean ball
one<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.640> problems<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.540> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
towards the target so when you see a pro

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.940 
towards the target so when you see a pro
turn<00:02:05.549> you'll<00:02:05.820> see<00:02:05.880> them<00:02:06.210> turn<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> you'll<00:02:07.710> see

simply wait for the ball and add a

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.640 
simply wait for the ball and add a
little<00:02:22.390> leverage<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> straight<00:02:23.620> arm

again a cause of tennis elbow
but<00:02:39.280> remember<00:02:39.670> leverage<00:02:40.239> using<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> entire

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
but remember leverage using the entire

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.160

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
through a greater source of leverage so

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.839 
through a greater source of leverage so
