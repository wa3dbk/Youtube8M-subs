00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.970
 [Music] 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.970
 all right 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 hello youtube friends as they walk I hope 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 that are well are welcome to a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.790
 video more to explain them and in this video 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.149
 you will learn how to download geometric 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:27.780
 in version 1.92 but if other 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:30.090
 versions I'll be updating it and good 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.369
 this version is totally portable and does not 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 will need any type of emulator 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.900
 since sometimes these emulators 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 chain a series of errors as per 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.560
 example remains hanging from the emulator and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.900
 among other things 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.150
 one of the things that I like the most 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.430
 game that is very entertaining although to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.790
 13 times a bit because it's a bit 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.420
 difficult and what I can highlight the most 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.090
 also this game is your music has a 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.580
 incredible pace when you play 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.770
 filled like a kind of full sand already 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.420
 you'll see it when the Thursday's well we're going to 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.280
 download this game for it all that 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.550
 go to the link will be down in the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.040
 description of the video for now I have it 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.290
 on my website I do not know I think I 'm going to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.500
 close it is safer if already 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.350
 just prepared a blog in blogger's 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.900
 backing is very similar to this and good 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.900
 it will be almost the same simply here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.540
 in the description the thumbnail of 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.130
 program that I have done and here for 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.070
 download it you just have to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.619
 select one of these two servers 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.350
 of downloads be it half fire or the mega 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.990
 the one you like most is going to select and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 here he will send you first to the short 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.869
 or I point like just wait 5 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.790
 seconds in each one and will already pass to 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.189
 download server there you what 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.039
 download and once this is done you 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.520
 is going to be this file rar are you going to 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.740
 give right click and extract here already a 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.409
 Once this is done here, we will have this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.539
 folder as I said is portable so 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.509
 You can upload it anywhere, either in 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.450
 a usb or as you want we are going to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.670
 open this folder and here it contains all 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.350
 these files also here there is an access 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 direct to the page where I 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.900
 download that is small game puntoinfo 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.299
 there I downloaded it but if I tell you that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.739
 it's a little complicated to download it and so 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.290
 that the most advisable thing is that 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.980
 Download this link below 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.720

 there is also a shortcut so that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.140
 go to my channel and well the most 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.330
 important here is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.560

 this game like I told him to try to pass 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.870
 obstacles and also the music is going to 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.190
 help a bit and with the adrenaline of 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.530
 this game 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.110
 it's not as easy as it seems and this alone 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.910
 is the first level you'll see with everything 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.910
