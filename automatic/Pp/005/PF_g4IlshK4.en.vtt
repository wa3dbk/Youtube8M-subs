know I said that I was gonna do own body
proportions<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.830> just<00:00:11.250> realized<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:12.170> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
proportions but I just realized that the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.020 
proportions but I just realized that the
way<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.349> draw<00:00:13.679> eyes<00:00:13.980> from<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.490> frontal<00:00:14.969> view

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
way you draw eyes from a frontal view

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.260 
way you draw eyes from a frontal view
isn't<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> same<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.350> drawing<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.310> from<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
isn't the same as drawing it from the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.480 
isn't the same as drawing it from the
side<00:00:18.539> views<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.920> gonna<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> real

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
side views so I'm just gonna do a real

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.640 
side views so I'm just gonna do a real
quick<00:00:20.550> tutorial<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> um<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:22.230> least<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> my

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
quick tutorial on that um at least in my

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.769 
quick tutorial on that um at least in my
Edition<00:00:23.010> anyway

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
Edition anyway

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.269 
Edition anyway
bla<00:00:24.779> bla<00:00:24.810> bla<00:00:24.990> start<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> bottom<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
bla bla bla start with the bottom of the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.120 
bla bla bla start with the bottom of the
eyes<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:27.090> course<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:28.650> types<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.949> eyes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
eyes of course with these types of eyes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
eyes of course with these types of eyes
down<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.210> goes<00:00:30.810> lower<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> considering

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
down here it goes lower but considering

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
down here it goes lower but considering
that<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.760> person<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> facing<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:37.020> left<00:00:37.739> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
that this person is facing to my left so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.779 
that this person is facing to my left so
ya<00:00:38.550> left<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.980> line<00:00:41.960> drop<00:00:42.960> some<00:00:43.469> more

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
ya left this line drop some more

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.190 
ya left this line drop some more
diagonally<00:00:44.789> towards<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> left<00:00:45.450> anyway<00:00:45.840> like

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
diagonally towards the left anyway like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
diagonally towards the left anyway like
that<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:48.170> then<00:00:49.170> after<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.039> draw<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.870> top

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that so then after that you draw the top

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.830 
that so then after that you draw the top
of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> eye<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> still

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
of the eye and this one is still

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
of the eye and this one is still
somewhat<00:00:55.260> rounded<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:57.289> fully<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:59.239> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
somewhat rounded but not as fully like I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.480 
somewhat rounded but not as fully like I
should<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.350> shut<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:09.049> okay<00:01:10.049> there's<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
should just shut up okay there's the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.920 
should just shut up okay there's the
outline<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.590> then<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.810> try<00:01:16.049> drawing<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
outline and then you try drawing the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.399 
outline and then you try drawing the
pupil<00:01:19.100> for<00:01:20.100> getting<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> word<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.409> only

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
pupil for getting the word for it only

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
pupil for getting the word for it only
it's<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.009> exactly<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> most<00:01:25.009> even<00:01:26.009> oval<00:01:26.909> but

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it's not exactly the most even oval but

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.740 
it's not exactly the most even oval but
you've<00:01:28.110> ever<00:01:28.290> seen<00:01:31.759> okay<00:01:32.759> blah<00:01:33.180> blah<00:01:33.479> there's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you've ever seen okay blah blah there's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.030 
you've ever seen okay blah blah there's
that<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.860> light<00:01:35.070> spots<00:01:36.290> okay<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> save

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that the light spots okay just to save

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
that the light spots okay just to save
time<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.460> gonna<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.820> lazy<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
time I'm gonna be lazy and not do the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
time I'm gonna be lazy and not do the
whole<00:01:39.750> shading<00:01:40.229> thing<00:01:40.409> cuz<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:41.100> much

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
whole shading thing cuz that pretty much

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
whole shading thing cuz that pretty much
does<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.670> change<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.950> basically<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
does not change just basically as on the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.569 
does not change just basically as on the
top<00:01:46.860> um

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
top um

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
eyelid it kind of favors the left side

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
eyelid it kind of favors the left side
as<00:01:52.170> far<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.380> height<00:01:52.649> goes<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.670> it's

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
as far as height goes and then it it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.499 
as far as height goes and then it it's
kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.310> uneven<00:01:56.310> rainbow<00:01:56.820> type<00:01:57.090> thing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
on shading in that thing so next you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.070 
on shading in that thing so next you
know<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.860> eyes<00:02:08.270> side

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
know these eyes side

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
know these eyes side
side<00:02:10.740> view<00:02:12.500> okay<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> bottom<00:02:14.400> line

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
side view okay you put the bottom line

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.550 
side view okay you put the bottom line
at<00:02:14.850> around<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> same<00:02:15.330> area<00:02:16.050> where<00:02:16.200> you'd<00:02:16.350> put

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
at around the same area where you'd put

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.780 
at around the same area where you'd put
on<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.040> line<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.580> K<00:02:17.790> ohms<00:02:18.050> only<00:02:20.990> these<00:02:21.990> eyes

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
on the line for K ohms only these eyes

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.700 
on the line for K ohms only these eyes
instead<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:28.410> goes

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
instead of it going like this it goes

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.440 
instead of it going like this it goes
opposite<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.820> how<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
opposite like this and see how this is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.120 
opposite like this and see how this is
higher<00:02:33.660> than<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.010> that's

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
higher than this and this one that's

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.670 
higher than this and this one that's
vice-versa<00:02:35.820> Yatta

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
vice-versa Yatta

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.720 
vice-versa Yatta
okay<00:02:39.410> that's<00:02:40.410> how<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> draw<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.580> but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
okay that's how you kind of draw it but

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360 
okay that's how you kind of draw it but
not<00:02:42.470> insanely<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> point<00:02:44.160> where<00:02:44.280> they

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
not insanely to the point where they

side<00:03:47.850> that's<00:03:48.330> more<00:03:48.600> here<00:03:49.110> towards<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.680> right

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
side that's more here towards the right

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.380 
side that's more here towards the right
okay<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.489> part<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.700> touches<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.239> line

but<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.350> barely<00:03:56.780> goes<00:03:57.780> diagonal<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
but then it barely goes diagonal to the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.710 
but then it barely goes diagonal to the
part<00:03:58.769> with<00:03:59.040> doesn't<00:03:59.850> touch<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.150> line<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.540> like

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
part with doesn't touch the line so like

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
like that and then you draw another line

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.010 
like that and then you draw another line
like<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.100> another<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:13.850> like<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.120> and
