 It is a basic creation to make first. 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.233
 Put a thread on your finger. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.140
 Hold the yarn end on the right side of the knitting, 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.160
 Loosely wrap it twice around your left forefinger. 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.520
 Remove the wound thread and hold it with your right hand 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.480
 The longer thread leading to the thread ball 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.960
 Scissors in the foreground from between the little finger on the left hand and the ring finger 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.320
 Through between the index finger and the middle finger, 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:52.480
 Hold the looped thread with the middle finger and thumb of the left hand.

 Thread end is facing down 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.500
 Put the crochet in the ring and pull the thread out. 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:43.540
 Thread and pull it out again. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.260
 I was able to make a circle. 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.020
 This is the creation of the circle. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.320
 From here, we will weave the next stitch. 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.160
 Usually, after knitting the crocodile stand, you can enter the next knitting method. 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.440

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 Pull out the two threads on the needle.
