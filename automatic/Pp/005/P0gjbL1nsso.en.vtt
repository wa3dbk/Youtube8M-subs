long history of we led up to this fight
I<00:03:43.670> think<00:03:44.420> when<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.870> concentrate<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:46.160> that

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
I think when you concentrate on that

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.220 
I think when you concentrate on that
more<00:03:46.550> than<00:03:46.580> your<00:03:46.820> opponent<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.450> think<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.050> are

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
more than your opponent I think you are

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.350 
more than your opponent I think you are
slightly<00:03:48.620> distracted<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.640> he's<00:03:50.090> going<00:03:50.300> to

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
slightly distracted and he's going to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.580 
slightly distracted and he's going to
have<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.480> sleep<00:03:50.750> with<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.960> for<00:03:51.290> day<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.500> a

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
have to sleep with that for day and a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.760 
have to sleep with that for day and a
half<00:03:51.770> and<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.630> be<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:54.140> negative
