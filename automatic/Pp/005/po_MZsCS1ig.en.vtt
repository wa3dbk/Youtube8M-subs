00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.430
 two 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.160
 hello my first 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 What is it that is basically like 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.910
 all at once is this hidden streak that 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.970
 it's a fashion how you get it because I have 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.770
 that kill 25 enemies with only the weapon 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.419
 I think it's also worth knife grenades 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.730
 and others but it's not worth the losing streak 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.460
 for example or anything else worth 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.440
 claudio so personally if you want 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.880
 take out I recommend the gusts of 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.190
 specialist already knows that this streak 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.739
 can give us low runs give us 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.600
 advantages the truth that we are quite 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.180
 useful because in this case I get to 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.829
 get up to 12 advantages, I'll do 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.480
 a video explaining how to use the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.949
 streak specialist in the best way 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.379
 possible because I'm seeing people that the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.870
 is using to get the caem 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 as I say but I think they are not 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.100
 using the truth really well that 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 I think I have to teach something 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 pretty curious about the gusts 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.220
 specialists and how to have more and more 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.540
 advantages that I know that much still not what 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 you know but you can have more 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.560
 Advantages of series without carrying 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.150
 specialists and even so good we 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.770
 we focus on the gameplay a little iguana 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.960
 you see how you see domain departure 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.720
 because if not, it does not take time to get it out 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.000
 m as I say but I will tell you what 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.440
 way taking out caem in duel by teams 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.020
 in confirmed low in all modes of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.780
 game but good this is my first fashion 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 so to speak, here I like you and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 the truth that as you can see I am first my 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 team is quite advanced the truth 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.720
 to say that my team was very good 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.850
 I know if individually but 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.070
 collectively the team was great or 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 be here as the first part is what 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.970
 I do is basically try to make 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.740
 enemies do not go beyond their backing 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.500
 because they had taken here they had 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 taken they had take 12 and the truth is that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.220
 we wanted to let him out of there as you see 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.810
 I did not talk to my allies or anything 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.000
 we simply understood each other by playing 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.340
 the truth that I played a pretty team 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 well as I say I do not know if individually 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.300
 but collectively the team was very 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.800
 well we already kept at bay that 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
 is what I like in domain that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.050
 is there are to capture two flags leave the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.420
 enemy one and overtake let's say like 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.330
 keep all allies online 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.069
 in front or like to close the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620
 Truth is something that I quite liked 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.390
 of the gameplay because as I say my team 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 honestly that's how I would not have 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.090
 this team surely would not have 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.890
 taken out 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.140
 as I say the truth that the caem has not 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.180
 cost a lot compared to fashion in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.909
 the modern warfare 3 because good fashion 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.920
 I took it out on December end of 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.629
 December I agree and this for me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.370
 has been released in 6 days or that is to leave the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.810
 game and today is the first time that I've 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.099
 put the gusts of specialist 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 the first time I said that I'm going to 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.849
 try to pull out an ak m that you have seen 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.099
 people who are taking it out and well I'm going 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.540
 to try and see what happens in my 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.120
 first game that happened to me good 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.489
 I stayed a lot I stayed at 6 of the caem 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.329
 the second game I stayed at all of 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 the emea 2 to 2 and I come uncle good is 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.200
 that I was really crazy the truth that I was 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.299
 playing really crazy and then the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.489
 third game I went back to two 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.379
 of the caem and therefore already in this 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.299
 departure that went the fourth of the day 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.310
 I say fuck, I mean, I'll go this time 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.810
 more tranquilito and I will try to get out 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.030
 the ya because he's seeing what's crazy 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.140
 and it always appeared the one responds that 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.760
 the truth that the game is quite touching 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.440
 from this call of duty that is a 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.120
 restaurant as vengeful not in plan 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.620
 you kill a player and you appear 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.540
 practically to the side so that I can 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.280
 kill again here as you see the team 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.630
 take the flag good flag indeed I 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.940
 I'm the one who takes the third flag 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.790
 Garrafal, that is, can not do it. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.260
 you can do unless you know very 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.070
 well play dominion in playing very well 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.600
 this map 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.190
 I personally do not know how to play very well 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.660
 dominion is to play this map very well 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.400
 so he really on the street 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.930
 doing that here I heard steps because 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.090
 The truth is that in this call of duty 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.440
 they listened quite the steps and it's from 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.730
 great help what happens that many times 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.380
 He also fucks you not because he says here that 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.930
 imagine you would have killed me the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.940
 shit that's because now all the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.950
 world me before leaving as it says year 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.080
 berkeley next year or more boxing nova 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.910
 betty and I say no no you calm that 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.770
 you will not see any of that just have only 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.810
 put other different things that is what 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.340
 very basically that really in and what 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.350
 I do not even use a grenade 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.060
 obviously already explain why I 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.980
 I put granada or put myself 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.540
 secondary and everything has to do with 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.950
 advantages, I'll explain it to you in a 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.630
 video explaining all the advantages 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.880
 explaining how they are used from the best 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.710
 way the truth that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.480
 I'm really enjoying this call 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.580
 of duty the truth there are many people a lot 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.990
 especially a lot of youtube that I do not know if it's 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.700
 who want the call of duty or 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.030
 that they are criticizing but it seems to me 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.590
 in an incredible way that is when 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.300
 I really do not understand it or I have 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.730
 talked to other youtuber who really 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.230
 if they say that fuck that is true not 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.520
 it's so bad that if they had 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.950
 guided by the first impression of 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.210
 some youtubers that is not even you 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.280
 they would have bought but the truth is that 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.990
 this is pretty good at least in 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.060
 the multiplayer evidently the campaign 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.700
 QUAD not already and possibly up one 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.960
 walk fruit of the campaign but in play 4 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.000
 Okay, I know that I will catch the play 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.650
 four meetings as soon as I leave 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.440
 pilla will the call of duty attentive 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.180
 critical moment or is it gives me I'm touched 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.130
 I see an enemy I'm out of balance with 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.410
 the secondary I run out of bullets that 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.430
 recharge and thanks to my fucking friend or 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.740
 what makes my friend my friend 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.289
 starting in this case 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.900
 and kill him and save me be as he says this 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.150
 through love I am three of the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.710
 caem and now when I get nervous and 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.340
 not the next thing is to take them here 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.280
 they were sure very very very nervous 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.780
 the truth is that it is more if they had 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.599
 taken the tap at that moment 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.849
 I would have exploded the truth that as 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.530
 You see I have this weapon that is the hönninger 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.389
 I think it's called and the truth is that 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.910
 really good real really the 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.009
 I recommend an assault rifle that is a 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.870
 ie hybrid is the type of weapon that 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.330
 I love it, it's like a submachine gun 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.590
 mixed with an assault rifle the weapon 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.690
 is in the category of rifles 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.060
 assault good active as nervous as 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.470
 failure is how many bullets failed there and 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.139
 It's obviously my fault but it's that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.580
 I was very very nervous as I say this 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.069
 weapon is a hybrid that is a 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.659
 combination a mixture between the rifles 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.099
 and the assault rifles as I say this 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.000
 weapon is in the category of rifles 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.980
 assault but 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.600
 long distance does not go as well as 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.610
 others a single jump but short 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.050
 distance goes far better than another 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.570
 assault rifle so it really is 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.390
 a very versatile weapon is to say you are worth 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.580
 for medium short distance even 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.930
 long and know how to use it well and 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.850
 truth that is a weapon with the recommend 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.280
 As I say it comes with series silencer 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.680
 and I the only thing that I put was hilt 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.960
 to have greater precision and also to 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.420
 I put the loaders accessory extended 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.010
 the truth that he has 45 bullets in the 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.830
 charger with this accessory the truth 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.750
 that is fucking here as you see kills 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.640
 this enemy finally got me the caem 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.650
 here I go crazy said I'm left with my 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.240
 life finally to the fourth game less 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.270
 they go because it's already starting to 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.190
 stylize I do not say uncle where the fuck 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.710
 that is going there is co and such I do not 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.450
 I took the love for 2 as well as the 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.710
 kids here is going to finish the video 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.780
 I hope you liked my first 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.330
 obviously you are going to have more 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.130
 I think I reach those more than 150 that I 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.870
 serve in modern warfare 3
