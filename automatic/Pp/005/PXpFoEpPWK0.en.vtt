00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Servus people welcome to the fitness tv 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 my name is raffael and want today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 we pursue a topic that belongs to the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 Sport as the air to breathe 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.360
 because we want to sweat that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 analyze what is sweating why 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.199
 sweat we sweat is good or 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.039
 bad 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:21.539
 First of all, what is it? 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.660
 Sweating is the body's own sweat 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 Men's cooling system regularly sports 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.769
 will notice that he starts to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.480
 sweat that is because of that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.340
 it is being stimulated 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 Blood pumped through the body 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 It warms you and your body has to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.640
 of course, this body temperature again 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.700
 jan the norms in the normal range 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 bring and that's why we sweat 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 Sweating is the natural way 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.649
 Air conditioning of the people 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 It just works 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.210
 by evaporation cold on our skin 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 yes, a water film is formed 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 sweat film and this evaporates through 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 the heat we give and thereby 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 of course we cool down many think 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 now the sweat something with the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 who has a lot to do with connection 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.330
 The sweat burns many calories 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.049
 much fat is the that is not so 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.060
 Unfortunately it is false 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.610
 As I said, sweating has something 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.430
 to do with the body temperature regulation 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 it is also so much water and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.229
 nutrients are lost through the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.479
 sweat 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 accordingly who long against the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.259
 fat against the fat on his body 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 should want to fight accordingly 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
 that compensate for this loss of water 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 speaking drinking water 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 There are studies in the proven 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030
 that was already a percent 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 Water loss by sweating too 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 performance losses leads accordingly 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 You should at the latest after half a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.610
 hour or even better during the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.930
 trainings generally take water 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.189
 has something to sweat with bad 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 condition to do 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 speak catch and trained faster 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 to sweat as trained no that is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 it is rather that wrong 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.579
 trained people start faster 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.049
 to sweat and these more too 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.700
 sweat as and are trained 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.350
 that is because that too 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.329
 the sweat glands are trained 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 Body is, so to speak, patterns of behavior 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
 and starts to sweat more efficiently 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 faster to sweat 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.879
 that has the consequence that the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.190
 Body temperature is much much later 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.200
 So much more slowly increased than at 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.629
 someone who is untrained 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
 that, in turn, makes you longer 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.480
 at a certain performance level 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 can work out without the performance 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.750
 decreases 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.019
 you already notice sweating is actually 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 a good thing such an important thing 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.780
 Of course there are also problems with that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.910
 Sweat as I said it is a bit 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 disgusting I say times though 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.849
 that is not really needed 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.590
 As I said it is an important thing 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.090
 In addition, there are also people who have 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.620
 There are problems with sweating 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.900
 about ten percent of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.790
 world population produce either too 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.650
 much or too little sweat 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.690
 if you have problems with the sweat 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.830
 So you should have problems with Switzerland 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.569
 You may even have a dermatologist 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.019
 Visit there a few tips 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.670
 give 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.959
 otherwise it was that I hope so 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.400
 could give you some information about 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.290
 Sweat the subject matter if you 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.730
 have questions send us like epm per 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.530
