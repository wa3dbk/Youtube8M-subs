00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
personal spin on Greek mythology I did a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.149 
personal spin on Greek mythology I did a
ton<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:05.019> research<00:01:05.110> I'm<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.619> bit<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.890> history

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
ton of research I'm a bit of a history

buff<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.940> mythology<00:01:07.180> buff<00:01:07.540> as<00:01:07.690> well<00:01:07.869> I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
buff and a mythology buff as well I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.080 
buff and a mythology buff as well I
found<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.710> if<00:01:09.070> you're<00:01:09.490> going<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.640> tackle<00:01:09.909> a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
found that if you're going to tackle a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.730 
found that if you're going to tackle a
subject<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.869> respect<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.320> subject

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
subject you have to respect the subject

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.889 
subject you have to respect the subject
so<00:01:11.950> we<00:01:11.979> can't<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:12.550> do<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.030> facade<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.720> Greek

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
so we can't just do a facade of Greek

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.940 
so we can't just do a facade of Greek
architecture<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.470> have<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.679> really

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
architecture you have to really

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.550 
architecture you have to really
understand<00:01:15.369> what<00:01:16.090> are<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.479> proportions<00:01:17.170> how

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
understand what are the proportions how

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.460 
understand what are the proportions how
big<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> base<00:01:18.220> compared<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.850> column<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
big is the base compared to a column and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340 
big is the base compared to a column and
compared<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.619> top<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:22.229> there's<00:01:23.229> gonna

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
compared to the top of it there's gonna

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.010 
compared to the top of it there's gonna
be<00:01:23.500> things<00:01:23.710> like<00:01:24.149> cyclopses<00:01:25.149> Minotaur<00:01:25.690> things

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
be things like cyclopses Minotaur things

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.660 
be things like cyclopses Minotaur things

faithful to that type of mythology of
course<00:01:31.990> there's<00:01:32.289> always<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.890> slight<00:01:33.340> twist<00:01:33.700> or

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
course there's always a slight twist or

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.850 
course there's always a slight twist or
spin<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.479> will<00:01:34.990> put<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.259> things<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.679> make

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
spin that will put on things to make

spin that will put on things to make
them<00:01:36.039> you<00:01:36.280> know<00:01:36.310> bigger<00:01:36.789> better<00:01:37.210> than<00:01:37.509> then

them you know bigger better than then

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.680 
them you know bigger better than then
they<00:01:38.350> may<00:01:38.649> be<00:01:39.069> represented<00:01:39.220> in<00:01:39.690> traditional

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 

I<00:01:44.310> look<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.300> archetypes<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:46.590> recurring

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I look at archetypes these recurring

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.070 
I look at archetypes these recurring
themes<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.730> human<00:01:48.060> storytelling<00:01:48.720> what's<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
themes in human storytelling what's the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.220 
themes in human storytelling what's the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
most efficient way to to communicate

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.110 
most efficient way to to communicate
this<00:01:52.410> for<00:01:53.010> example<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.550> someone<00:01:53.760> has<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
this for example if someone has to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.790 
this for example if someone has to
represent<00:01:54.270> death<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.350> need<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
represent death what do you need to put

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.350 
represent death what do you need to put
in<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.310> order<00:01:56.550> for<00:01:56.940> him<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.330> like

as much as the first one helped us to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.280 
as much as the first one helped us to
start<00:03:31.060> off<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.390> know<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> foundations<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.200> a

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
start off you know the foundations of a

game<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.650> second<00:03:33.010> one<00:03:33.100> will<00:03:33.310> really<00:03:33.610> really

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
game the second one will really really

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.610 
game the second one will really really
show<00:03:34.180> people<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.780> few<00:03:35.170> things<00:03:35.350> that<00:03:35.470> this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
show people a few things that this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.960 
show people a few things that this
hardware<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:35.980> able<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.310> do<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.910> believe

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
hardware is able to do and I believe

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.540 
hardware is able to do and I believe
right<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:37.840> I'm<00:03:38.050> very<00:03:38.590> proud<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.950> say<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
right now I'm very proud to say that the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.310 
right now I'm very proud to say that the
guys<00:03:39.700> who<00:03:39.880> actually<00:03:39.910> was<00:03:40.300> they<00:03:40.930> have<00:03:41.050> pulled

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
guys who actually was they have pulled

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.110 
guys who actually was they have pulled
off<00:03:41.440> probably<00:03:41.830> with<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.490> best<00:03:42.670> technology<00:03:43.090> on

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
off probably with the best technology on

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.910 
off probably with the best technology on

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.530 

ultimately<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.400> game<00:03:51.580> is<00:03:51.790> about<00:03:52.000> brutal

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
ultimately the game is about brutal

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.630 
ultimately the game is about brutal
combat<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.620> team<00:03:53.800> wanted<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.220> make<00:03:54.400> sure

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640

PSP controls from the ps2 version was a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.990 
PSP controls from the ps2 version was a

for<00:04:09.520> example<00:04:09.880> dodge<00:04:10.060> went<00:04:10.480> from<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.840> analog

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200

for example dodge went from the analog
which<00:04:11.580> which<00:04:12.580> I<00:04:12.790> think<00:04:13.000> would<00:04:13.120> be<00:04:13.150> natural<00:04:13.660> for

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
which which I think would be natural for

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.900 
which which I think would be natural for
people<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.140> do<00:04:14.260> now<00:04:14.590> having<00:04:15.340> played<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.640> God<00:04:15.790> of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910

II<00:04:20.830> felt<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.580> little<00:04:21.730> awkward<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:23.110> think<00:04:23.410> it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
II felt a little awkward but I think it

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.830

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
took us about a week to really know play

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
came to us naturally and now sometimes

when<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.010> think<00:04:30.220> our<00:04:30.310> war<00:04:30.550> 2<00:04:30.760> on<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> ps2<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.720> have

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.210 
when I think our war 2 on the ps2 I have
a<00:04:32.110> tendency<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.560> use<00:04:32.890> that<00:04:33.040> button

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220

is no type of windmill move which is

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.970 
is no type of windmill move which is
really<00:05:08.870> cool<00:05:09.050> because<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:09.530> don't<00:05:09.740> think<00:05:09.770> you've

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
really cool because I don't think you've

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.770 
really cool because I don't think you've
ever<00:05:10.070> got<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:10.880> out<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.090> God<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.450> War<00:05:11.540> really

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.570 
ever got that out of God of War really
before<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.710> what<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:12.950> get<00:05:13.100> out<00:05:13.130> of<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.550> a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
before and what you get out of this is a

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.070 
before and what you get out of this is a
very<00:05:13.820> focused<00:05:14.000> attack<00:05:14.450> something<00:05:14.750> that<00:05:14.990> you

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
very focused attack something that you

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.110 
very focused attack something that you
can<00:05:15.230> target<00:05:15.500> on<00:05:15.590> one<00:05:15.770> enemy<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.310> will<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.850> a<00:05:16.880> lot

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
can target on one enemy I will do a lot

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.330 
can target on one enemy I will do a lot
of<00:05:17.150> damage<00:05:17.450> but<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.560> have<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.800> be<00:05:18.890> careful<00:05:19.250> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
of damage but you have to be careful to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.770 
of damage but you have to be careful to
use<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:20.090> big<00:05:20.300> group<00:05:20.420> for<00:05:20.660> example

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
use it in a big group for example

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.440 
use it in a big group for example
because<00:05:21.350> at<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.920> end<00:05:22.040> of<00:05:22.100> that<00:05:22.220> move<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:23.180> end

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
because at the end of that move you end

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.090 
because at the end of that move you end
up<00:05:23.600> in<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.780> very<00:05:23.960> vulnerable<00:05:24.170> position<00:05:24.530> and

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
up in a very vulnerable position and

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.070 
up in a very vulnerable position and
what<00:05:25.820> we<00:05:25.970> wanted<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.300> give<00:05:26.540> with<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.870> was<00:05:27.050> a

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
what we wanted to give with that was a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.690 
what we wanted to give with that was a
tactic<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.680> strategy<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.430> use<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.730> move<00:05:30.700> the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
tactic a strategy to use that move the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.760 
tactic a strategy to use that move the
puzzles<00:05:32.060> in<00:05:32.330> God<00:05:32.690> of<00:05:32.810> War<00:05:32.990> are<00:05:33.290> definitely<00:05:33.740> a

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
puzzles in God of War are definitely a

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.020 
puzzles in God of War are definitely a
very<00:05:33.830> important<00:05:34.250> element<00:05:34.640> of<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.850> gameplay

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
very important element of the gameplay

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.450 
very important element of the gameplay
there's<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.020> lot<00:05:36.140> of<00:05:36.260> action<00:05:36.680> and<00:05:36.980> we<00:05:37.220> need<00:05:37.250> to

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
there's a lot of action and we need to

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.220 
there's a lot of action and we need to
break<00:05:37.640> up<00:05:37.910> some<00:05:38.150> of<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:38.390> with<00:05:38.660> some<00:05:38.840> downtime

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
break up some of that with some downtime

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.660 
break up some of that with some downtime
and<00:05:39.560> one<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.860> good<00:05:39.980> ways<00:05:40.100> of<00:05:40.250> doing<00:05:40.370> that

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
and one of the good ways of doing that

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.250 
and one of the good ways of doing that
is<00:05:40.880> by<00:05:40.910> giving<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.510> players<00:05:41.780> something<00:05:41.990> that

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
is by giving the players something that

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.180 
is by giving the players something that
they<00:05:42.320> have<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.500> do<00:05:42.710> where<00:05:42.980> they<00:05:43.070> actually

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
they have to do where they actually

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.800 
they have to do where they actually
exercise<00:05:43.790> in<00:05:43.970> mine

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
we range from simple puzzles where we
