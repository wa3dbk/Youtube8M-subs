before I started watching it from the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.300 
before I started watching it from the
beginning<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.380> saw<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.740> couple<00:05:53.979> of<00:05:54.160> episodes

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
beginning and I saw a couple of episodes

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.969 
beginning and I saw a couple of episodes
that<00:05:54.669> were<00:05:54.820> in<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.510> early<00:05:55.870> 500s<00:05:56.620> during<00:05:56.890> a

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
that were in the early 500s during a

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.920 
that were in the early 500s during a
