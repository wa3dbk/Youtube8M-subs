00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
resolution of titanfall will increase as
the<00:01:41.610> team<00:01:41.939> edges<00:01:42.270> closer<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> final<00:01:43.229> build

the team edges closer to the final build

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
the team edges closer to the final build
and<00:01:43.770> could<00:01:44.159> potentially<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> region

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and could potentially be in the region

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
and could potentially be in the region
of<00:01:45.450> 900p<00:01:46.049> native<00:01:46.409> resolution<00:01:46.619> once<00:01:47.220> complete

on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> Xbox<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:50.939> sounds<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> stretch<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
on the Xbox one sounds like a stretch to

on the Xbox one sounds like a stretch to
me<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.619> 900p<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
me I think it's going to be 900p at the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
me I think it's going to be 900p at the
most<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> absolute<00:01:55.020> most<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> turns

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
most at the absolute most if it turns

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
most at the absolute most if it turns

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.330 
let me tell you this when I was playing
it<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.990> didn't<00:02:28.260> think<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> resolution<00:02:29.010> of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
it I didn't think that the resolution of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.160 
it I didn't think that the resolution of
this<00:02:29.460> game<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.850> pathetic<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.750> thinking

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
this game was pathetic I was thinking

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
this game was pathetic I was thinking
about<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.500> amazing<00:02:31.740> parkour<00:02:32.310> mechanics<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
about the amazing parkour mechanics and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.340 
about the amazing parkour mechanics and
how<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.390> from<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.750> point<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> map

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
how I can get from one point of the map

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.080 
how I can get from one point of the map
to<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> next<00:02:35.070> without<00:02:35.310> even<00:02:35.640> thinking<00:02:35.670> about

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to the next without even thinking about

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.120 
to the next without even thinking about
it<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.480> felt<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:36.930> Peter<00:02:37.230> Pan<00:02:37.530> floating<00:02:38.040> around

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
it I felt like Peter Pan floating around

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.950 
it I felt like Peter Pan floating around
it<00:02:38.550> was<00:02:38.670> absolutely<00:02:39.120> seamless<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.750> straight

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
it was absolutely seamless a straight

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.510 
it was absolutely seamless a straight
Peter<00:02:40.170> Pan<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.530> course<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.130> thinking<00:02:41.400> about

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
Peter Pan of course I was thinking about

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.430 
Peter Pan of course I was thinking about
the<00:02:41.670> rush<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.000> excitement<00:02:42.150> as<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:42.840> Titan<00:02:43.260> came

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the rush of excitement as my Titan came

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.500 
the rush of excitement as my Titan came
crashing<00:02:43.980> down<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> earth<00:02:44.460> like<00:02:45.150> Courtney

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
crashing down to the earth like Courtney

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.330 
crashing down to the earth like Courtney
Love<00:02:45.750> during<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> relapse<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.160> thinking

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
Love during a relapse I was thinking

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340 
Love during a relapse I was thinking
about<00:02:47.670> how<00:02:47.850> amazingly<00:02:48.420> well<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.870> game<00:02:49.050> plays

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
about how amazingly well the game plays

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.410 
about how amazingly well the game plays
and<00:02:49.680> looks<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.490> thinking<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.180> sense

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
and looks I was thinking about the sense

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.180 
and looks I was thinking about the sense
of<00:02:51.540> achievement<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.200> gave<00:02:52.380> me<00:02:52.560> even<00:02:52.890> though<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
of achievement it gave me even though I

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.650 
of achievement it gave me even though I
wasn't<00:02:53.430> doing<00:02:53.580> technically<00:02:54.030> well<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
wasn't doing technically well on the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.960 
wasn't doing technically well on the
scoreboard<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.470> 720p<00:02:56.040> resolution<00:02:56.310> didn't

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
scoreboard the 720p resolution didn't

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.370 
scoreboard the 720p resolution didn't
even<00:02:57.150> enter<00:02:57.270> my<00:02:57.510> mind<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.960> wasn't<00:02:58.140> even

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
even enter my mind I wasn't even

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.140 
even enter my mind I wasn't even
thinking<00:02:58.440> about<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.100> because<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.490> was<00:02:59.730> seduced

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
thinking about it because I was seduced

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.480 
thinking about it because I was seduced
by the<00:03:00.450> gameplay<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.230> was<00:03:01.470> also<00:03:01.710> thinking<00:03:01.920> I

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
by the gameplay I was also thinking I

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.310 
by the gameplay I was also thinking I
could<00:03:02.550> never<00:03:02.880> go<00:03:03.120> back<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.360> call<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.840> duty<00:03:04.110> but

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
could never go back to call of duty but

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.410 
could never go back to call of duty but
that's<00:03:04.500> another<00:03:04.800> video<00:03:05.160> if<00:03:05.430> titanfall<00:03:05.940> comes

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that's another video if titanfall comes

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.010 
that's another video if titanfall comes
out<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.960> it's<00:03:07.320> only<00:03:07.470> 792<00:03:08.250> p<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.820> 720p<00:03:09.450> guess

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
out and it's only 792 p or 720p guess

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140 
out and it's only 792 p or 720p guess
