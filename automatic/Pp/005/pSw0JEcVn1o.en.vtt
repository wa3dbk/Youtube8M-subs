into it and an angle pattern make it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.290 
into it and an angle pattern make it
easier<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.570> feel<00:02:43.900> fine<00:02:44.290> whatever<00:02:44.739> I'm<00:02:45.300> yes

easier to feel fine whatever I'm yes

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.460 
easier to feel fine whatever I'm yes
that's<00:02:46.510> pretty<00:02:46.660> much<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.900> there<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that's pretty much it there for the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.540 
that's pretty much it there for the
black<00:02:47.680> room<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.270> can<00:02:52.360> see<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:53.310> little<00:02:54.310> over

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
black room as you can see a little over

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.010 
black room as you can see a little over
to<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> white<00:02:54.940> 1i<00:02:55.150> which<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.570> actually<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
to the white 1i which is actually on the

to the white 1i which is actually on the
galaxy<00:02:57.239> s4<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.730> can<00:03:00.880> see<00:03:01.320> st.<00:03:02.320> Colette's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
galaxy s4 so you can see st. Colette's

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
galaxy s4 so you can see st. Colette's
exact<00:03:02.920> same<00:03:03.040> design<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.820> only<00:03:04.000> difference

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
exact same design the only difference

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.870 
exact same design the only difference
between<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.320> colors<00:03:05.650> which<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.670> same<00:03:06.820> for

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
between the colors which is the same for

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.759 
between the colors which is the same for
all<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> other<00:03:07.299> colors<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.690> do<00:03:07.840> celibate<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
all the other colors to do celibate I

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.190 
all the other colors to do celibate I
think<00:03:09.310> five<00:03:09.459> or<00:03:09.640> six<00:03:09.850> different<00:03:10.000> versions<00:03:10.780> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
think five or six different versions of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.699 
think five or six different versions of
it<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:13.049> hard<00:03:14.049> plastic<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.680> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
it and it's the hard plastic on the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.860 
it and it's the hard plastic on the
inside<00:03:15.100> looking<00:03:15.820> at<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.060> dead-on<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.690> will

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
inside looking at it dead-on you will

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.570 
inside looking at it dead-on you will
not<00:03:16.989> be<00:03:17.140> able<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.320> really<00:03:17.530> tell<00:03:17.739> unless<00:03:18.370> you

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
not be able to really tell unless you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.039 
not be able to really tell unless you
learn<00:03:18.670> from<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> side<00:03:19.269> where<00:03:19.570> we<00:03:19.810> have<00:03:19.959> the

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
learn from the side where we have the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.130 
learn from the side where we have the
white<00:03:20.230> here<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.280> all<00:03:21.820> this<00:03:22.060> part<00:03:22.600> here<00:03:22.810> all<00:03:22.959> the

black on all of them and belief and see
the<00:03:29.920> cover<00:03:30.100> itself<00:03:30.430> fits<00:03:31.299> perfectly<00:03:31.810> on<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
the cover itself fits perfectly on the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.180 
the cover itself fits perfectly on the
device<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:34.530> not<00:03:35.530> difficult<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.950> get<00:03:36.100> off

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
device and it's not difficult to get off

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.830 
device and it's not difficult to get off
but<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.549> more<00:03:36.640> difficult<00:03:36.790> than<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> galaxy

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
but it's more difficult than the galaxy

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.720 
but it's more difficult than the galaxy
note<00:03:37.870> 2<00:03:38.200> version<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.680> remember<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.250> just<00:03:39.459> slip

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
note 2 version I remember that just slip

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.550 
note 2 version I remember that just slip
pretty<00:03:40.060> much<00:03:40.239> one<00:03:40.900> corner<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.440> whole

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
pretty much one corner and the whole

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.220 
pretty much one corner and the whole
thing<00:03:41.739> would<00:03:41.860> pop<00:03:42.040> off<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.959> harder

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
thing would pop off and this is a harder

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.280 
thing would pop off and this is a harder
and<00:03:44.440> harder<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.799> get<00:03:44.890> off<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:46.049> just<00:03:47.049> push

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
and harder to get off but you just push

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.400 
and harder to get off but you just push
like<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:48.330> push<00:03:49.330> through<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.570> camera<00:03:49.870> you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
like that push through the camera you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.320 
like that push through the camera you
get<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> edge<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.190> device<00:03:51.760> out<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.209> then

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
get the edge of the device out and then

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.970 
get the edge of the device out and then
hit<00:03:52.989> your<00:03:53.049> finger<00:03:53.350> neat<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.739> that's<00:03:53.860> pretty

them<00:04:03.250> press<00:04:05.040> hope<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.370> hear<00:04:06.459> that

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
them press hope you can hear that

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.400 
them press hope you can hear that
um<00:04:08.250> yeah<00:04:09.250> they<00:04:09.430> work<00:04:09.610> perfectly<00:04:10.090> adding<00:04:10.810> they

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
um yeah they work perfectly adding they

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.839 
um yeah they work perfectly adding they
feel<00:04:11.590> better<00:04:11.739> than<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.099> buttons<00:04:12.400> themselves

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
feel better than the buttons themselves

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.670 
feel better than the buttons themselves
on<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.030> guys<00:04:13.180> here's<00:04:13.450> four<00:04:13.660> which<00:04:14.290> are<00:04:14.440> fairly

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
on the guys here's four which are fairly

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.580 
on the guys here's four which are fairly
slim<00:04:15.010> fairly<00:04:15.489> easy<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.819> miss<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.590> they're

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
slim fairly easy to miss and they're

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.960 
slim fairly easy to miss and they're
much<00:04:17.739> higher<00:04:17.980> than<00:04:18.010> they<00:04:18.340> were<00:04:18.459> in<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.639> galaxy

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
much higher than they were in the galaxy

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.599 
much higher than they were in the galaxy
s3's<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.600> your<00:04:19.720> coma<00:04:19.840> from<00:04:19.959> galaxy<00:04:20.440> s3<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:21.459> was

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
s3's of your coma from galaxy s3 it was

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.280 
s3's of your coma from galaxy s3 it was
kind<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:21.880> annoying<00:04:22.090> because<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.840> know<00:04:22.960> just

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
kind of annoying because you know just

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.050 
kind of annoying because you know just
to<00:04:23.410> change<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.889> it<00:04:24.100> was<00:04:24.280> for<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.610> banner<00:04:24.790> book

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
to change but it was for the banner book

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.240 
to change but it was for the banner book
you'd<00:04:25.720> get<00:04:25.930> used<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.320> galaxy<00:04:26.620> s3<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.070> you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
you'd get used to the galaxy s3 and you

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.710 
you'd get used to the galaxy s3 and you
be<00:04:27.340> moving<00:04:27.639> back<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.940> proper<00:04:28.300> arrangement

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
be moving back to a proper arrangement

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.860 
be moving back to a proper arrangement
but<00:04:28.840> either<00:04:29.260> way<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:30.190> Cobra<00:04:30.520> adds<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:31.330> pretty

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
but either way the Cobra adds a pretty

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.070 
but either way the Cobra adds a pretty
decent<00:04:32.169> tactile<00:04:32.500> feedback<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.900> yeah<00:04:34.900> that's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
decent tactile feedback and yeah that's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.960 
decent tactile feedback and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:35.230> much<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:35.650> for<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.040> buttons<00:04:36.430> like<00:04:36.700> you

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
pretty much it for the buttons like you

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.200 
pretty much it for the buttons like you
know<00:04:37.090> they<00:04:37.810> work<00:04:38.020> they<00:04:38.320> do<00:04:38.440> their<00:04:38.620> job<00:04:39.210> best

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
know they work they do their job best

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.969 
know they work they do their job best
I've<00:04:40.419> seen<00:04:40.450> in<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.750> cobra<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.169> far<00:04:41.440> better<00:04:41.889> than

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
I've seen in a cobra so far better than

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.280 
I've seen in a cobra so far better than
the<00:04:42.160> otterbox<00:04:42.580> once<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.450> only<00:04:44.020> revealed

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
the otterbox once but I only revealed

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.870 
the otterbox once but I only revealed
the<00:04:44.410> defender<00:04:44.860> case<00:04:45.070> which<00:04:45.280> is<00:04:45.400> pretty<00:04:45.639> much<00:04:45.820> a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the defender case which is pretty much a

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.879 
the defender case which is pretty much a
different<00:04:46.210> level<00:04:46.479> for<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> protection<00:04:47.110> that's

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
different level for a protection that's

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.050 
different level for a protection that's
really<00:04:48.100> designed<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.490> protect<00:04:48.639> your<00:04:48.910> phone

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
really designed to protect your phone

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.879 
really designed to protect your phone
not<00:04:49.270> really<00:04:49.450> designed<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.960> work<00:04:50.139> well<00:04:50.470> or<00:04:50.530> look

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
not really designed to work well or look

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.620 
not really designed to work well or look
good<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.310> just<00:04:51.370> really<00:04:51.610> there<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:52.060> protect

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
good it's just really there to protect

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.379 
good it's just really there to protect
your<00:04:52.810> device<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.380> these<00:04:54.280> are<00:04:54.669> designed<00:04:55.330> to

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
your device and these are designed to

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.870 
your device and these are designed to
protect<00:04:55.540> your<00:04:55.780> device<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.350> an<00:04:57.160> extent<00:04:57.580> they<00:04:57.669> do

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
protect your device to an extent they do

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.760 
protect your device to an extent they do
offer<00:04:58.210> great<00:04:58.780> protection<00:04:59.139> on<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.380> corners

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
offer great protection on the corners

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.200 
offer great protection on the corners
which<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.250> most<00:05:00.400> important<00:05:00.880> factor<00:05:01.180> I

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
which is the most important factor I

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.480 
which is the most important factor I
think<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.570> any<00:05:01.690> cover<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:03.160> your<00:05:03.310> phone

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
think of any cover because if your phone

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.280 
think of any cover because if your phone
drops<00:05:03.820> whatever<00:05:04.270> cover<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:04.660> hits<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.960> corner

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
drops whatever cover and hits a corner

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.170 
drops whatever cover and hits a corner
small<00:05:05.950> impact<00:05:06.370> points<00:05:06.700> will<00:05:06.850> definitely

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
small impact points will definitely

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.050 
small impact points will definitely
shatter<00:05:07.419> your<00:05:07.600> just<00:05:07.810> entire<00:05:08.260> display<00:05:08.560> and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
shatter your just entire display and

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.000 
shatter your just entire display and
well<00:05:10.060> then<00:05:10.210> you're<00:05:10.360> out<00:05:10.510> six<00:05:11.139> seven<00:05:11.800> hundred

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
well then you're out six seven hundred

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.800 
well then you're out six seven hundred
euro<00:05:12.160> device<00:05:12.520> unless<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.390> want<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.600> get<00:05:13.690> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
euro device unless you want to get the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.990 
euro device unless you want to get the
display<00:05:14.470> fixed<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:14.950> they're<00:05:15.070> pretty<00:05:15.700> costs

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
display fixed and they're pretty costs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.450 
display fixed and they're pretty costs
especially<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.660> galaxy<00:05:17.020> s4<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.620> other

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
especially the galaxy s4 and other

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.850 
especially the galaxy s4 and other
devices<00:05:18.789> that<00:05:19.030> are<00:05:19.240> out<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.570> moment<00:05:19.930> but<00:05:20.289> you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
devices that are out the moment but you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.150 
devices that are out the moment but you
AG<00:05:21.190> definitely<00:05:22.200> aimed<00:05:23.200> for<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.770> corners

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
AG definitely aimed for the corners

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.590 
AG definitely aimed for the corners
which<00:05:24.340> is<00:05:24.460> nice<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:24.820> see<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.180> same<00:05:25.390> the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
which is nice to see the same the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.150 
which is nice to see the same the
previous<00:05:25.990> designs<00:05:26.350> so<00:05:26.860> they<00:05:27.010> know<00:05:27.130> exactly

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
previous designs so they know exactly

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.330 
previous designs so they know exactly
what<00:05:27.580> they<00:05:27.789> don't<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.620> yeah<00:05:29.620> overall<00:05:30.070> I

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
what they don't and yeah overall I

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.830 
what they don't and yeah overall I
really<00:05:30.580> like<00:05:30.970> this<00:05:31.120> cover<00:05:31.360> it's<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.660> one<00:05:31.810> I

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
use simply because the aesthetics I like

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.620 
use simply because the aesthetics I like
to<00:05:34.930> look<00:05:35.080> at<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.350> device<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:36.330> with<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.450> cover

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630
