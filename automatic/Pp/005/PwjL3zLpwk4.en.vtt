00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
block right about the crankshaft line

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.469 
block right about the crankshaft line
there<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.520> said<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> same<00:01:18.299> as

there and like I said it is the same as

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.020 
there and like I said it is the same as
the<00:01:18.570> camshaft<00:01:19.049> sensor<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.740> these<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.729> fairly

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the camshaft sensor and these are fairly

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
the camshaft sensor and these are fairly
inexpensive<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.110> twenty<00:01:22.439> five<00:01:22.590> twenty

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
new wanted autozone it's right here so

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.679 
new wanted autozone it's right here so
holding<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.720> ten<00:01:33.720> millimeter<00:01:34.170> socket

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 

and<00:01:37.200> once<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.280> screw<00:01:38.609> will<00:01:38.640> pry

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and once we take out this screw will pry

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.399 
and once we take out this screw will pry
it<00:01:39.569> out<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.499> new<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
it out and put the new one in

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.849 
it out and put the new one in
so<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:44.420> want<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> disconnect<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.409> connector

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
so I want to disconnect the is connector

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.279 
so I want to disconnect the is connector
here<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:48.179> they<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.539> press<00:01:49.229> on

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this little piece on the side and tore

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.309 
this little piece on the side and tore
it<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:55.979> up<00:01:56.659> once<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.929> out<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.289> way

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
it right up once that's out of the way

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:06.949 
it right up once that's out of the way
just<00:02:03.109> go<00:02:04.109> unscrew<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.420> 10<00:02:06.420> millimeter

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
just go unscrew this 10 millimeter

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:15.229 
just go unscrew this 10 millimeter
little<00:02:07.170> bolt<00:02:11.959> pull<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.519> your<00:02:14.790> sensor

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
little bolt pull it out and your sensor

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.759 
little bolt pull it out and your sensor
should<00:02:15.269> come<00:02:15.599> right<00:02:16.019> out<00:02:16.049> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.620> use<00:02:16.739> a

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
should come right out you can use a

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.660 
should come right out you can use a
screwdriver<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.370> type<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.849> out

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
screwdriver to type right out

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.890 
screwdriver to type right out
so<00:02:20.670> uh<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.329> using<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.690> regular<00:02:23.900> flat

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
so uh I'm just using a regular flat
