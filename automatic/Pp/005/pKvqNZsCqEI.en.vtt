one<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.930> issues<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> battery<00:02:23.740> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
one of the issues with the battery the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.380 
one of the issues with the battery the
battery<00:02:23.980> needs<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.460> replaced<00:02:24.670> every<00:02:25.210> 2<00:02:25.360> or

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
battery needs to be replaced every 2 or

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.850 
battery needs to be replaced every 2 or
3<00:02:25.630> months<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.350> need<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.530> stay<00:02:26.680> on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
3 months so you really need to stay on

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.450 
3 months so you really need to stay on
it<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:28.020> had<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.050> number<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.290> folks<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.680> try<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
it I had a number of folks that try to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.010 
it I had a number of folks that try to
get<00:02:30.610> any<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> their<00:02:30.880> saves<00:02:31.150> after<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> short

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
get any of their saves after a short

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.120 
get any of their saves after a short
period<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.260> time<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.620> battery's<00:02:32.920> dead

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
period of time the battery's dead

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.280 
period of time the battery's dead
obviously<00:02:34.090> not<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> good<00:02:34.450> situation<00:02:34.630> if<00:02:35.140> it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
obviously not a good situation if it's

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.460 
obviously not a good situation if it's
an<00:02:35.380> emergency<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.210> if<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.960> are<00:02:38.080> gonna<00:02:38.230> go<00:02:38.320> that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
an emergency so if you are gonna go that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.880 
an emergency so if you are gonna go that
route<00:02:38.620> make<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.420> following<00:02:41.290> and

route make sure you you following and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.100 
route make sure you you following and
stay<00:02:42.130> tuned<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:43.240> power<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.540> battery<00:02:43.930> which
