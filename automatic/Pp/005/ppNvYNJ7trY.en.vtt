first<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:44.030> BTC<00:00:45.680> dashi<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
first of all BTC dashi and I use that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.410 
first of all BTC dashi and I use that
sigh<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> time<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> don't<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.180> why<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> had

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
sigh all the time I don't know why I had

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.229 
sigh all the time I don't know why I had
to<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.020> spell<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.940> actually

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to look how you spell it but it actually

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
to look how you spell it but it actually
added<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.430> peercoin<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.969> USD<00:00:54.480> ticker<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.440> well

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
added the peercoin to USD ticker as well

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.340 
added the peercoin to USD ticker as well
so<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.670> exchange<00:00:56.879> bitcoins<00:00:57.690> for

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so now you can exchange bitcoins for

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.330 
so now you can exchange bitcoins for
peercoin<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.789> also<00:00:59.910> exchange<00:01:00.890> USD<00:01:01.890> for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
peercoin and you also exchange USD for

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
peercoin and you also exchange USD for
pure<00:01:02.579> coin<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> vice<00:01:03.270> versa<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.960> both<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
pure coin and vice versa on both of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.789 
pure coin and vice versa on both of

too<00:01:19.350> high<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.430> investors

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
too high now for really investors

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.100 
too high now for really investors
looking<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> huge<00:01:22.470> no<00:01:22.860> quick<00:01:23.100> game<00:01:23.869> but<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
know it's going up there and like I said

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.270 
know it's going up there and like I said
I<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> almost<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> direct<00:01:28.710> competitor

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
I see it almost as you direct competitor

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370 
I see it almost as you direct competitor
to<00:01:29.520> litecoin<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.570> only<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.990> peercoin

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to litecoin the only thing that peercoin

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330 
to litecoin the only thing that peercoin
has<00:01:31.560> against<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.680> older<00:01:35.130> or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
has against it is it it's it's older or

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
has against it is it it's it's older or
I<00:01:35.369> mean<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.850> reg<00:01:36.119> junger<00:01:36.600> than<00:01:36.780> litecoin

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I mean not all reg junger than litecoin

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
I mean not all reg junger than litecoin
and<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.890> its<00:01:38.009> name<00:01:38.310> isn't<00:01:38.820> fully<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.270> there

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and so its name isn't fully out there

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
and so its name isn't fully out there
yet<00:01:39.659> but<00:01:40.380> compared<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.799> litecoin<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
yet but compared to litecoin it's a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
yet but compared to litecoin it's a
pretty<00:01:42.030> pretty<00:01:42.720> even<00:01:43.320> playing<00:01:43.680> field<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
pretty pretty even playing field you

guys I think peercoin is really starting
to<00:03:06.780> regain<00:03:06.930> its<00:03:07.349> potential<00:03:07.889> value<00:03:08.189> that<00:03:08.310> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to regain its potential value that I
