 Hello dear play here is again 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.960
 like meters of tons with a new addon 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.390
 He guided the cross online 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.340
 Today we'll take a look at the addon 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.200
 destinations to which you see here 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.360
 normal web here are a few 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.840
 markings are these markings 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.540
 come over the aoi on the mini map 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.020
 addon which is relatively new but that means 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.910
 we are not looking at that today 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.070
 I in another video so this one 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.310
 advance tui at the top but we 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.899
 look at destinations today 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.969
 destinations is a very cool add on 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:51.969
 for inquiries quester but also for 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.510
 achievement unmarried, so to speak so 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.359
 if you go to a map and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.129
 Then take what wanted to take 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.929
 destinations you see here 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.420
 there are secular for example 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.130
 here you see many many possessions 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.720
 red cross now suddenly the wall 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.940
 not there before and you see that is 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.400
 interesting that not command the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.570
 but have not been discovered by me 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 only interesting areas too 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.400
 public also left the exam 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.240
 even a public left too 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.920
 screaming away 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.439
 all I have not yet discovered 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.299
 is already red marked an old one 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.420
 Well is marked so you know where 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.390
 that is the border between upper and 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.280
 under karl stone is marked here in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.659
 The old area shadow fan where I enter 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.640
 few times she was still a few quests 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.079
 but I have already done all this 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.420
 but the gift for the poor 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.500
 Achievement is here for example 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.610
 there at the point i can do this 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.219
 create an achievement 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.149
 Here you can see where the heat of vampires 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.340
 roam in the highest area again in 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 I see another 8 immediately 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.710
 i have not finished a dolmen yet yes 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 So with these destinations you can 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.820
 you really look around what I have 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.399
 probably not yet discovered what I have 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 probably not done yet and you can too 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.299
 then set here 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.570
 how should the pin look like the pin 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.390
 to be seen at all this 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.400
 pins be big small what colors 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.980
 should have which pins should have 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 example, the addition 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 Achievements are full 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.320
 the nose you have on his nose 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.530
 jump down 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.370
 or you have to be the intrepid 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.280
 to spend drinks 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.780
 that is also displayed here yes that is 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.700
 also an achievement in every area 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.600
 the intrepid one drink 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.820
 output 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.330
 that is quite funny then react 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.520
 nice times in the taverns and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 how do they see the ruins from where they get 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.230
 So you have the wema parts for the new ones 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.170
 armor or for the new books yes 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.440
 also that one can be indicated 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.030
 then where are these quest donors that is 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 also interesting for the then no 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.990
 quest done or something like that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.510
 I still need one now 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.880
 quest for the quest achievement then 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 which is new or what you can still find here 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.600
 see trophies and fishing grounds where 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.880
 Can I catch fish where can I get 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.920
 trophies for my trophy trophies 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.270
 So if you can find parts of the pug 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.600
 then there is also achievement 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.710

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.750
 you adjust everything you find everything 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.490
 then in the game what you are looking for also for 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.870

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.660
 and you already have a new addon in the game 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.680
 of course that would have to be there again 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.160
 turn on 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.620
 but that's relatively cool because you 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.510

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.570
 yes what use do I lead you can 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.820
 After after banquet we are replicating ourselves 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.060
 look for cartons and so on 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.870
 looks for categories and options 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.229
 one stops where is the addon directory 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.449

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.729
 update automatically 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.439
 But I can also say that should 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.009
 automatically thought that media 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.919
 windows-start or I can say 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.479
 download more at the same time or me 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.279
 can set proxy if i do that 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.499
 So if I do not want a normal one 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.210
 I would like to use internet connection 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.559
