straightening irons hair spray and some
sea<00:00:25.619> salt<00:00:25.800> spray<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.029> jump<00:00:27.300> right<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
sea salt spray so let's jump right in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
sea salt spray so let's jump right in
I'm<00:00:28.410> starting<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.099> freshly<00:00:29.400> washed<00:00:29.699> hair

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
I'm starting with freshly washed hair
although<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> imagine<00:00:30.570> Dale<00:00:31.080> hair<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.560> also

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
although I imagine Dale hair would also

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
although I imagine Dale hair would also
work<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.309> fact<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> would<00:00:32.759> probably<00:00:32.940> work<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
work in fact it would probably work a

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.639 
work in fact it would probably work a
little<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.660> better<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
little bit better to have some of that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
little bit better to have some of that
natural<00:00:34.950> texture<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.360> gonna<00:00:36.480> find

natural texture and I'm just gonna find

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780 
natural texture and I'm just gonna find
where<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:36.989> natural<00:00:37.469> middle<00:00:37.710> part<00:00:37.980> lies<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this where the curl starts inward first

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.480

I<00:02:15.960> can't<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:16.500> explain<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.280> tell

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
I can't really explain it but I can tell

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.520

you<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.790> does<00:02:18.030> look<00:02:18.300> good<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.750> so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you that it does look good as well so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.050 
you that it does look good as well so
just<00:02:19.560> experiment<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.220> what<00:02:20.430> works<00:02:20.610> best<00:02:20.880> for

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
just experiment with what works best for

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.150 
just experiment with what works best for
you<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.630> then<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> opposite

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
you and then you can see on the opposite

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.800 
you and then you can see on the opposite
side<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.400> my<00:02:23.640> head<00:02:23.850> I'm<00:02:24.000> doing<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.270> same<00:02:24.480> thing

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
I am going forward and pulling down and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
I am going forward and pulling down and
then<00:02:27.330> flipping<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.020> curling<00:02:28.380> our<00:02:28.470> backers

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
then flipping the curling our backers

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
then flipping the curling our backers
and<00:02:29.070> pulling<00:02:29.430> down<00:02:29.580> again<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.120> some<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and pulling down again and some of the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
and pulling down again and some of the
curls<00:02:30.990> are<00:02:31.080> going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> come<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.530> more

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
curls are going to come out more

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.990 
curls are going to come out more
straight<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.460> then<00:02:32.670> we're<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> come

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
straight and so then we're going to come

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.340 
straight and so then we're going to come
back<00:02:33.120> more<00:02:33.390> currently<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.110> kind<00:02:34.290> of
