know if anyone else can get this it's
probably<00:02:24.270> still<00:02:25.140> made<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.850> got<00:02:27.090> quite<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
probably still made but it's got quite a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.410 
probably still made but it's got quite a
bit<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.990> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
bit in it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.530 
bit in it
very<00:02:30.420> nice<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> tells<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.080> everything<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
very nice it tells you everything so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.100 
very nice it tells you everything so
yeah<00:02:33.690> I'm<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.170> your<00:02:34.290> update<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.830> engine

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
yeah I'm sure your update of the engine

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.410 
yeah I'm sure your update of the engine
it's<00:02:37.110> pretty<00:02:37.650> clean<00:02:37.890> aside<00:02:38.250> I'm<00:02:38.910> gonna<00:02:39.300> be

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
it's pretty clean aside I'm gonna be

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's pretty clean aside I'm gonna be
making<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.900> custom<00:02:40.650> exhaust<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.670> it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
making a custom exhaust for it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.020 
making a custom exhaust for it
so<00:02:43.230> another<00:02:43.470> engine<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.980> had<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> stack<00:02:44.670> off

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
so another engine that had a stack off

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.690 
so another engine that had a stack off
of<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.470> I'm<00:02:46.590> gonna<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.459> have

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
of it now what I'm gonna do is I have

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.220 
of it now what I'm gonna do is I have
this<00:02:47.940> half-inch<00:02:53.269> try<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.330> think<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.750> 1/2<00:02:55.050> inch

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
this half-inch try to think of 1/2 inch

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.040 
this half-inch try to think of 1/2 inch
male<00:02:55.560> adapter<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.780> pipe<00:02:58.140> thread<00:02:58.670> this<00:03:00.050> nut

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
male adapter to pipe thread this nut

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.910 
male adapter to pipe thread this nut
here<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.560> from<00:03:01.890> romex<00:03:02.489> connector<00:03:02.970> electrical

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
here is from romex connector electrical

here is from romex connector electrical
conduit<00:03:04.920> its<00:03:05.810> fits<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.519> pipe<00:03:08.519> thread<00:03:09.170> and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
conduit its fits on pipe thread and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.530 
conduit its fits on pipe thread and
that's<00:03:11.310> pretty<00:03:11.730> much<00:03:11.850> what<00:03:12.090> any<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
that's pretty much what any of the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.440 
that's pretty much what any of the
locking<00:03:13.220> rings<00:03:14.220> are<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.880> exhausts

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
locking rings are for the exhausts

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.229 
locking rings are for the exhausts
anyways<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.590> anyway<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:17.910> I'm<00:03:18.030> gonna

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
anyways so anyway this is what I'm gonna

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.250 
anyways so anyway this is what I'm gonna
do<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:19.049> lock<00:03:19.260> nut<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.900> made<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:23.180> here

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
do is your lock nut and I made this here

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.660 
do is your lock nut and I made this here
this<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.530> what<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:25.829> gonna<00:03:26.010> make<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.489> got<00:03:26.640> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
this is what I'm gonna make I got a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.640 
this is what I'm gonna make I got a
solder<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.269> still<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:29.690> yeah<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:31.170> gonna<00:03:31.500> look

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
solder it still but yeah it's gonna look

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.490 
solder it still but yeah it's gonna look
nice<00:03:32.010> 3/4<00:03:33.000> inch<00:03:34.940> tubing<00:03:35.940> regular<00:03:37.940> elf

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
nice 3/4 inch tubing regular elf

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.949 
nice 3/4 inch tubing regular elf
tubing<00:03:40.530> Emmas<00:03:41.130> thinner<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.760> believe<00:03:42.360> or<00:03:42.840> it's

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
tubing Emmas thinner I believe or it's

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.850 
tubing Emmas thinner I believe or it's
the<00:03:43.079> opposite<00:03:43.470> way<00:03:43.880> not<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> big<00:03:45.090> deal<00:03:45.799> what<00:03:46.799> I

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
the opposite way not a big deal what I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:55.160 
the opposite way not a big deal what I
had<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.280> do<00:03:51.170> because<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.530> 3/4<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.930> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
had to do because this is 3/4 this is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.560 
had to do because this is 3/4 this is
1/2<00:03:55.650> inch<00:03:55.980> street<00:03:57.350> sweep<00:03:58.350> 90<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.570> this

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
1/2 inch street sweep 90 this is this

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.770 
1/2 inch street sweep 90 this is this
will<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:00.870> in<00:04:00.989> here<00:04:01.380> obviously<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:03.390> other<00:04:03.510> ends

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
will go in here obviously the other ends

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.449 
will go in here obviously the other ends
got<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.019> bail<00:04:04.170> on<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:04.950> same<00:04:05.010> size

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
got the bail on it so it's the same size

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.979 
got the bail on it so it's the same size
so<00:04:05.940> what<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.090> had<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.269> do<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.690> three

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
so what I had to do with the three

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.370 
so what I had to do with the three
quarter<00:04:07.500> pipe<00:04:08.160> here<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.019> see<00:04:10.049> where

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
quarter pipe here is you can see where

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.020 
quarter pipe here is you can see where
it's<00:04:10.500> tapered<00:04:10.920> down<00:04:11.070> I<00:04:11.400> actually<00:04:11.579> beat<00:04:11.910> it

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
it's tapered down I actually beat it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.680 
it's tapered down I actually beat it
with<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> hammer

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
with a hammer

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.270 
with a hammer
and<00:04:14.060> shrunk<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.269> like<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> did<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.039> Rings

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
and shrunk it like I did with the Rings

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.250 
and shrunk it like I did with the Rings
I<00:04:17.519> make<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.030> start<00:04:18.450> with<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.599> coin<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
I make you start with a coin and

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.500 
I make you start with a coin and
keep<00:04:19.500> tapping<00:04:19.770> around<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.520> it<00:04:20.640> shrinks<00:04:21.240> it

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
keep tapping around it and it shrinks it

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.750 
keep tapping around it and it shrinks it
and<00:04:21.690> it's<00:04:22.500> essentially<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.040> same<00:04:23.100> idea<00:04:23.280> with

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
and it's essentially the same idea with

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.990 
and it's essentially the same idea with
this<00:04:23.850> tubing<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:25.650> there's<00:04:26.160> pulling<00:04:26.580> up<00:04:26.730> to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
this tubing so there's pulling up to

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.520 
this tubing so there's pulling up to
where<00:04:27.240> it's<00:04:27.420> snug

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
where it's snug

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.820 
where it's snug
it<00:04:29.250> should<00:04:29.760> snow<00:04:30.180> solder<00:04:30.600> if<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.200> doesn't<00:04:31.530> then

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
it should snow solder if it doesn't then

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.350 
it should snow solder if it doesn't then
I'll<00:04:32.010> have<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.430> figure<00:04:32.910> out<00:04:32.940> something<00:04:33.270> else

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
I'll have to figure out something else

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.830 
I'll have to figure out something else
but<00:04:33.890> once<00:04:34.890> it's<00:04:35.040> added<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.880> will<00:04:36.060> be<00:04:36.210> want

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
but once it's added this will be want

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.740 
but once it's added this will be want
that<00:04:37.020> like<00:04:37.200> straight<00:04:37.650> up<00:04:38.270> but<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.360> look<00:04:39.600> good

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
that like straight up but I look good

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.090 
that like straight up but I look good
just<00:04:40.170> like<00:04:40.290> that

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
just like that

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.880 
just like that
gonna<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.240> fairly<00:04:42.930> loud<00:04:43.230> but<00:04:43.620> you're<00:04:43.770> not

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
gonna be fairly loud but you're not

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.040 
gonna be fairly loud but you're not
gonna<00:04:43.980> be<00:04:44.100> running<00:04:44.190> at<00:04:44.430> full<00:04:44.760> throttle<00:04:45.060> here's

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
gonna be running at full throttle here's

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.460 
gonna be running at full throttle here's
the<00:04:46.260> mixer<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.910> mixer<00:04:48.300> will<00:04:48.450> fit<00:04:48.720> fine<00:04:49.080> right

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
the mixer the mixer will fit fine right

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.730 
the mixer the mixer will fit fine right
by<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:50.000> no<00:04:51.000> clearance<00:04:51.450> issues<00:04:54.650> unless<00:04:55.650> you

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
by it no clearance issues unless you

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.020 
by it no clearance issues unless you
want<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.950> take<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.250> off<00:04:56.400> and<00:04:56.640> you<00:04:56.700> got<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.910> take

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
year the engines are right there has

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.950 
year the engines are right there has
three<00:05:30.440> three<00:05:31.440> circles<00:05:31.890> there<00:05:32.040> where<00:05:32.580> we<00:05:32.700> got

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
three three circles there where we got

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.610 
three three circles there where we got
this<00:05:33.960> one<00:05:34.260> being<00:05:34.530> in<00:05:34.680> 1940<00:05:35.610> has<00:05:35.790> a<00:05:35.820> 40<00:05:36.360> I

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
this one being in 1940 has a 40 I

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.250 
this one being in 1940 has a 40 I
believe<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.830> four<00:05:38.780> represents<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:40.410> month<00:05:40.910> or

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
believe the four represents the month or

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.700 
believe the four represents the month or
maybe<00:05:43.260> it's<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:45.150> case<00:05:45.480> maybe<00:05:46.350> it's<00:05:48.710> whatever

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
maybe it's the case maybe it's whatever

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.930 
maybe it's the case maybe it's whatever
month<00:05:50.100> K<00:05:50.460> is<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:52.500> day<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.190> year<00:05:53.520> something

month K is the day in the year something
like<00:05:54.060> that<00:05:54.330> but<00:05:54.840> this<00:05:54.990> is<00:05:55.140> a<00:05:55.170> 1940<00:05:55.980> you<00:05:56.820> can

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
like that but this is a 1940 you can

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.810 
like that but this is a 1940 you can
also<00:05:57.120> go<00:05:57.420> off<00:05:57.660> of<00:05:57.990> oh<00:05:58.580> nice

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
also go off of oh nice

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.380 
also go off of oh nice
I'll<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.390> take<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.720> off<00:06:01.020> for<00:06:01.200> now<00:06:02.270> you<00:06:03.270> can

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
I'll just take this off for now you can

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.510 
I'll just take this off for now you can
also<00:06:03.540> go<00:06:03.690> off<00:06:03.840> of<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.170> bearing<00:06:04.770> plate<00:06:04.800> here

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
also go off of the bearing plate here

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.000 
also go off of the bearing plate here
your<00:06:05.640> backing<00:06:05.850> plate<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.960> also<00:06:07.500> tells<00:06:07.800> you

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
your backing plate that also tells you

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:16.030 
your backing plate that also tells you
same<00:06:08.730> spot<00:06:09.210> down<00:06:09.450> here<00:06:11.540> this<00:06:12.540> is<00:06:12.750> a<00:06:12.780> k1<00:06:13.880> 40<00:06:14.960> so

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
same spot down here this is a k1 40 so

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.690 
same spot down here this is a k1 40 so
that<00:06:17.040> was<00:06:17.130> something<00:06:17.400> that<00:06:18.980> the<00:06:19.980> number<00:06:20.520> there

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
that was something that the number there

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.740 
that was something that the number there
is<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.320> day<00:06:22.940> because<00:06:23.940> that's<00:06:24.030> a<00:06:24.180> 1<00:06:24.390> and<00:06:24.690> this

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
is the day because that's a 1 and this

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.189 
is the day because that's a 1 and this
is<00:06:24.900> a<00:06:24.960> 4<00:06:25.230> so

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
is a 4 so

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.570 
is a 4 so
it's<00:06:26.560> probably<00:06:26.860> all<00:06:26.979> within<00:06:27.249> the<00:06:27.370> same

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
it's probably all within the same

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.070 
it's probably all within the same
there's<00:06:28.150> something<00:06:28.389> probably<00:06:28.599> on<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:28.870> block

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
there's something probably on the block

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.760 
there's something probably on the block
