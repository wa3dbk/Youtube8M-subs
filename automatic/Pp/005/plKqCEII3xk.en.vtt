and set the yolk aside for this mass

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:55.560 
and set the yolk aside for this mass
we'll<00:00:38.040> only<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.430> using<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.790> egg<00:00:39.000> white

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.510 

next<00:00:56.570> use<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.900> fork<00:00:57.320> or<00:00:57.470> whisk<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:58.040> beat<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.370> egg

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
next use a fork or whisk to beat the egg

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.460 
next use a fork or whisk to beat the egg
white<00:00:58.790> until<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.270> color<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.600> consistent<00:01:00.350> and

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.399 

now<00:01:12.549> we'll<00:01:12.790> prepare<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.180> tissue<00:01:13.390> here<00:01:14.170> I'm

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
now we'll prepare the tissue here I'm

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.010 
now we'll prepare the tissue here I'm
using<00:01:14.650> a<00:01:14.920> durable<00:01:15.130> 1<00:01:15.670> ply<00:01:15.940> bathroom<00:01:16.450> tissue<00:01:16.630> I

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
using a durable 1 ply bathroom tissue I

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.170 
using a durable 1 ply bathroom tissue I
like<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.830> use<00:01:18.010> 1<00:01:18.220> ply<00:01:18.430> because<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.970> dries

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
like to use 1 ply because it dries

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.840 
like to use 1 ply because it dries
quicker<00:01:19.479> but<00:01:19.750> two-ply<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.229> also<00:01:20.619> fine<00:01:20.860> try<00:01:21.790> to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
quicker but two-ply is also fine try to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.880 
quicker but two-ply is also fine try to
use<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.119> tissue<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.260> good<00:01:23.409> quality

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
use a tissue that is of a good quality

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.590 
use a tissue that is of a good quality
because<00:01:24.070> poor<00:01:24.430> quality<00:01:24.759> tissue<00:01:25.030> will<00:01:25.360> tear

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
because poor quality tissue will tear

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.560 
because poor quality tissue will tear
easily<00:01:26.049> once<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.440> egg<00:01:26.590> white<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.890> added

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
easily once the egg white is added

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.109 
easily once the egg white is added
we'll<00:01:28.570> need<00:01:28.750> 6<00:01:29.229> squares<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.770> tissue<00:01:29.979> 3<00:01:30.820> squares

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
we'll need 6 squares of tissue 3 squares

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.120 
we'll need 6 squares of tissue 3 squares
cut<00:01:31.390> into<00:01:31.659> halves<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.200> three<00:01:32.590> squares<00:01:32.890> cut

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
cut into halves and three squares cut

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:49.450 
cut into halves and three squares cut
into<00:01:33.460> fourths

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.950 

now<00:01:50.460> let's<00:01:50.700> start<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> masks<00:01:51.240> start<00:01:51.840> by

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
now let's start the masks start by

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
now let's start the masks start by
applying<00:01:52.259> egg<00:01:52.560> white<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.159> section<00:01:53.520> of
