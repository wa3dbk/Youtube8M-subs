rails<00:00:34.350> booster<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:36.239> modified<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.930> what

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
rails booster and it's modified so what

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.690 
rails booster and it's modified so what
you<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> do<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> build<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.829> booster<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you want to do to build this booster is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.690 
you want to do to build this booster is
make<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.870> oval<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.550> two

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
make a little oval like this that's two

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.940 
make a little oval like this that's two
normal<00:00:42.300> tracks<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.719> each<00:00:42.930> end<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.530> powered

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
normal tracks on each end with powered

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.610 
normal tracks on each end with powered
rails<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> middle<00:00:44.780> throw<00:00:45.780> down<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> mine

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
rails in the middle throw down to mine

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.330 
rails in the middle throw down to mine
carts<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.989> get<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
carts like so and get them going in the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
carts like so and get them going in the
direction<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
direction you want which is probably the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.459 
direction you want which is probably the
biggest<00:00:52.949> challenge<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.730> booster<00:00:54.469> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
biggest challenge of this booster so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.209 
biggest challenge of this booster so
just<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> keep<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.989> okay<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just kind of keep there we go okay and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
just kind of keep there we go okay and
give<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> work<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> kinks

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
give them a little bit to work the kinks

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.479 
give them a little bit to work the kinks
out<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> once<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.309> they're

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
out and once you can see they're

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.700 
out and once you can see they're
glitching<00:01:02.940> together<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.379> means

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
glitching together like that that means

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
glitching together like that that means
that<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.339> minecart<00:01:05.880> track<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.510> ready<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> go

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that your minecart track is ready to go

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.609 
that your minecart track is ready to go
so<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:09.080> is<00:01:10.080> throw<00:01:10.380> down

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so now what you need to do is throw down

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.580 
so now what you need to do is throw down
the<00:01:10.740> cart<00:01:10.979> give<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.210> push<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> jump<00:01:13.439> in

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the cart give a little push and jump in

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
the cart give a little push and jump in
it<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> those<00:01:14.729> two<00:01:15.119> carts<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.689> glitch<00:01:15.990> into

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it and those two carts will glitch into

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
it and those two carts will glitch into
you<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> send<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.250> flying<00:01:17.729> at<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> pretty

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you and send you off flying at a pretty

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.660 
you and send you off flying at a pretty
decent<00:01:19.080> clip<00:01:20.180> okay<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.310> now<00:01:23.420> this<00:01:24.420> track<00:01:25.020> goes

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
decent clip okay so now this track goes

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.590 
decent clip okay so now this track goes
approximately<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.880> hundred<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> twenty

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
approximately one hundred and twenty

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.859 
approximately one hundred and twenty
eight<00:01:27.750> blocks<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.369> point<00:01:29.700> i<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.570> lazy

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
eight blocks at which point i got lazy

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
eight blocks at which point i got lazy
and<00:01:31.320> stopped<00:01:32.130> making<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> longer<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.150> then

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and stopped making it longer and then

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.679 
and stopped making it longer and then
just<00:01:33.570> sat<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> did<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.409> tests<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.689> did

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just sat down and did some tests and did

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.890 
just sat down and did some tests and did
the<00:01:37.140> math<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.799> whoa<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.850> failed<00:01:39.240> attempts

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the math on whoa well failed attempts

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.289 
the math on whoa well failed attempts
what<00:01:40.619> makes<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.280> makes<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> field<00:01:42.119> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
what makes you what makes the field of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
what makes you what makes the field of
mine<00:01:42.540> carts<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.530> i<00:01:43.680> had<00:01:43.860> failed

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
mine carts make you think i had failed

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
mine carts make you think i had failed
attempts<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.450> fail<00:01:45.930> anyway

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
attempts i don't i don't fail anyway

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
attempts i don't i don't fail anyway
like<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.460> said<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:49.100> 1128<00:01:50.100> blocks<00:01:50.520> long<00:01:52.130> 60

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
like I said it's 1128 blocks long 60

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.700 
like I said it's 1128 blocks long 60
some-odd<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> uphill<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> after

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
some-odd of which is uphill and so after

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.080 
some-odd of which is uphill and so after
futzing<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:01:59.579> while<00:01:59.790> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
futzing with this for a little while I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.510 
futzing with this for a little while I
decided<00:02:00.420> I'd<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.990> back<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.950> math<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
decided I'd go back and do the math to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
decided I'd go back and do the math to
see<00:02:02.759> how<00:02:03.360> far<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.049> how<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.680> pill<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
see how far and how much a pill you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.639 
see how far and how much a pill you
could<00:02:06.119> travel<00:02:06.509> using<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.380> system

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
could travel using this system

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.430 
could travel using this system
realistically<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.690> numbers<00:02:09.959> i<00:02:10.050> came<00:02:10.259> up

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
realistically and the numbers i came up

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
realistically and the numbers i came up
with<00:02:10.709> we're<00:02:11.370> pretty<00:02:11.580> interesting<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
with we're pretty interesting for that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.309 
with we're pretty interesting for that
single

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
126 of those blocks being uphill blocks

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.860 
126 of those blocks being uphill blocks
you<00:02:25.680> could<00:02:25.859> travel<00:02:26.129> farther<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.150> less<00:02:27.329> uphill

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
you could travel farther the less uphill

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.720 
you could travel farther the less uphill
blocks<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.379> have<00:02:28.620> because<00:02:29.459> each<00:02:31.730> each

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
blocks you have because each each

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
blocks you have because each each
incline<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.840> go<00:02:33.989> up<00:02:34.170> takes<00:02:34.439> a<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.739> bit<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
incline you go up takes a little bit of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.220 
incline you go up takes a little bit of
speed<00:02:35.549> away<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:39.329> will<00:02:39.359> travel<00:02:40.019> your

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
speed away and you will travel your

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.449 
speed away and you will travel your
first<00:02:40.760> 1000<00:02:41.760> blocks<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:43.879> two<00:02:44.879> minutes<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.459> 38

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
first 1000 blocks in two minutes and 38

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.039 
first 1000 blocks in two minutes and 38
seconds<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.750> average<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.379> got<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
seconds is the average I got for it and

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.949 
seconds is the average I got for it and
then<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.439> actually<00:02:52.889> gets<00:02:53.730> slower<00:02:54.269> as<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.719> go

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
then it actually gets slower as you go

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.599 
then it actually gets slower as you go
so<00:02:55.199> by<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.379> time<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.829> get<00:02:55.949> to<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.189> point

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
so by the time you get to the point

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.159 
so by the time you get to the point
where<00:02:56.879> you're<00:02:57.000> stopping<00:02:57.629> it's<00:02:57.750> actually

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
where you're stopping it's actually

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.649 
where you're stopping it's actually
going<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.469> take<00:02:58.680> an<00:02:58.859> extra<00:02:59.760> minute<00:02:59.879> to<00:03:00.060> travel

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
going to take an extra minute to travel

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.809 
going to take an extra minute to travel
the<00:03:00.870> next<00:03:01.230> 1000<00:03:01.889> blocks<00:03:03.409> but<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:04.439> think<00:03:04.829> just

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the next 1000 blocks but I think just

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.709 
the next 1000 blocks but I think just
for<00:03:06.060> two<00:03:06.239> golden<00:03:06.659> boosters<00:03:07.169> sending<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.719> two

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
for two golden boosters sending you two

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.920 
for two golden boosters sending you two
thousand<00:03:10.379> blocks<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:11.189> a<00:03:11.840> reasonable<00:03:12.840> amount

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
thousand blocks in a reasonable amount

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.689 
thousand blocks in a reasonable amount
of<00:03:13.169> time<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:13.889> about<00:03:13.949> it<00:03:14.129> actually<00:03:14.669> I

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
of time if you think about it actually I

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.550 
of time if you think about it actually I
mean<00:03:14.879> 2000<00:03:15.389> blocks<00:03:15.659> is<00:03:15.810> pretty<00:03:16.049> far<00:03:16.230> being

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
mean 2000 blocks is pretty far being

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.140 
mean 2000 blocks is pretty far being
able<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:16.949> get<00:03:17.099> there<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.669> um<00:03:17.939> Oh<00:03:19.849> under<00:03:20.849> 10

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
able to get there and um Oh under 10

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.119 
able to get there and um Oh under 10
minutes<00:03:21.449> really<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:23.569> think<00:03:24.569> pretty<00:03:25.319> good<00:03:25.769> is

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
minutes really is I think pretty good is

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.949 
minutes really is I think pretty good is
actually<00:03:26.729> pretty<00:03:27.120> cheap<00:03:27.479> because<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
actually pretty cheap because of the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.809 
actually pretty cheap because of the
fact<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.319> doesn't<00:03:28.500> need<00:03:28.799> much<00:03:29.099> gold<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.639> make

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
fact it doesn't need much gold to make

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.740 
fact it doesn't need much gold to make
because<00:03:31.519> golden<00:03:32.519> rails<00:03:32.729> don't<00:03:33.060> send<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.479> very

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
because golden rails don't send you very

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.830 
because golden rails don't send you very
far<00:03:34.139> at<00:03:34.500> all<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.909> would<00:03:36.120> need<00:03:36.239> tons<00:03:36.599> of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
far at all so you would need tons of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.270 
far at all so you would need tons of
gold<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.259> be<00:03:37.379> able<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.620> send<00:03:37.799> yourself<00:03:37.889> this

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
gold to be able to send yourself this

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.589 
gold to be able to send yourself this
far<00:03:38.519> whereas<00:03:39.299> with<00:03:39.329> that<00:03:39.689> single<00:03:40.409> booster<00:03:41.599> you

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
far whereas with that single booster you

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.179 
far whereas with that single booster you
can<00:03:42.780> send<00:03:42.989> yourself<00:03:43.109> all<00:03:43.439> of<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.040> way<00:03:44.159> out

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
can send yourself all of the way out

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.349 
can send yourself all of the way out
here<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.329> see<00:03:45.599> with<00:03:45.840> uh<00:03:45.870> with

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
here and you can see with uh with

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.849 
here and you can see with uh with
worldedit<00:03:48.359> I<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.870> kind<00:03:49.079> of<00:03:49.169> deleted<00:03:49.680> this

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
worldedit I just kind of deleted this

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.319 
worldedit I just kind of deleted this
out<00:03:50.040> here<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.489> once<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.699> got<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.239> I

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
out here so once I got to the end I

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.990 
out here so once I got to the end I
could<00:03:51.479> just<00:03:51.720> jump<00:03:52.409> off<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:53.009> send<00:03:53.459> myself<00:03:53.609> back

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
could just jump off and send myself back

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.270 
could just jump off and send myself back
to<00:03:54.180> spawn<00:03:54.449> because<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:54.930> far<00:03:55.349> too<00:03:55.379> lazy<00:03:55.889> to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
to spawn because I'm far too lazy to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.479 
to spawn because I'm far too lazy to
walk<00:03:56.459> over<00:03:56.819> there<00:03:57.060> genius<00:03:58.019> okay<00:03:58.469> so<00:03:59.219> we're

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
walk over there genius okay so we're

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.199 
walk over there genius okay so we're
back<00:03:59.609> at<00:03:59.819> spawn<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:01.609> now<00:04:02.609> I'm<00:04:02.759> going<00:04:02.969> to<00:04:03.090> talk

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
back at spawn and now I'm going to talk

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.439 
back at spawn and now I'm going to talk
about<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.509> couple<00:04:03.719> of<00:04:03.959> downsides<00:04:04.259> with<00:04:04.859> this

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
about a couple of downsides with this

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.529 
about a couple of downsides with this
it's<00:04:06.449> still<00:04:06.689> going<00:04:07.049> pretty<00:04:07.560> well<00:04:07.680> right<00:04:08.159> now

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:08.539 
it's still going pretty well right now

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:13.520 
it's still going pretty well right now
but<00:04:09.539> it<00:04:09.870> tends<00:04:10.859> not<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.810> first<00:04:12.810> off<00:04:13.019> it's<00:04:13.289> prone

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
but it tends not to first off it's prone

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.319 
but it tends not to first off it's prone
to<00:04:13.560> mobs<00:04:13.889> if<00:04:14.219> I'm<00:04:14.340> mob<00:04:14.519> bumps<00:04:14.849> into<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.180> it's

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
to mobs if I'm mob bumps into it it's

going to mess up secondly it's not

going to mess up secondly it's not
always<00:04:18.120> consistent<00:04:18.989> if<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.099> don't<00:04:20.400> give<00:04:20.639> it

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
always consistent if you don't give it

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.029 
always consistent if you don't give it
enough<00:04:21.150> time<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.659> warm<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.229> go<00:04:22.349> at<00:04:22.500> maximum

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
enough time to warm up and go at maximum

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.279 
enough time to warm up and go at maximum
speed<00:04:23.090> it's<00:04:24.090> only<00:04:24.300> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.659> send<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.020> about

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
speed it's only going to send you about

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.110 
speed it's only going to send you about
half<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.949> distance<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.610> capable

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
half the distance it's capable

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.909 
half the distance it's capable
which<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.720> still<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.960> thousand<00:04:28.470> blocks<00:04:28.710> which

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
which is still a thousand blocks which

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.420 
which is still a thousand blocks which
isn't<00:04:29.220> much<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.699> shake<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.810> lamb's<00:04:31.229> tail<00:04:31.830> at<00:04:32.130> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
isn't much to shake a lamb's tail at I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.780 
isn't much to shake a lamb's tail at I
just<00:04:33.150> combined<00:04:33.570> sayings<00:04:34.020> there<00:04:34.260> on<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.530> fly

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
just combined sayings there on the fly

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.719 
just combined sayings there on the fly
another<00:04:35.790> thing<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.270> know<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:37.520> there's<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.580> good

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
another thing to know is there's a good

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.000 
another thing to know is there's a good
chance<00:04:39.060> when<00:04:39.600> this<00:04:39.750> chunk<00:04:40.110> unloads<00:04:40.680> when<00:04:40.919> you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
chance when this chunk unloads when you

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.530 
chance when this chunk unloads when you
come<00:04:41.250> back<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.760> minecarts<00:04:42.210> won't<00:04:42.389> be

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
come back the minecarts won't be

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.740 
come back the minecarts won't be
spinning<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:44.160> not<00:04:44.370> necessarily

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
spinning so it's not necessarily

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.540 
spinning so it's not necessarily
something<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.800> just<00:04:46.919> set<00:04:47.190> up<00:04:47.340> and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
something that you can just set up and

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.610 
something that you can just set up and
go<00:04:48.979> but<00:04:49.979> if<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.400> have<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:51.090> village<00:04:51.600> 2000<00:04:52.410> blocks

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
go but if you have a village 2000 blocks

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.290 
go but if you have a village 2000 blocks
away<00:04:52.979> or<00:04:53.130> something<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:53.940> just<00:04:54.090> need<00:04:54.270> like

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
away or something and you just need like

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.870 
away or something and you just need like
a<00:04:54.479> one-way<00:04:55.050> shot<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.729> could

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
a one-way shot to it and if you could

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.310 
a one-way shot to it and if you could
put<00:04:57.000> these<00:04:57.180> on<00:04:57.360> both<00:04:57.540> ends<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.020> get<00:04:58.169> them

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
put these on both ends and get them

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.310 
put these on both ends and get them
going<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:59.040> so<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.030> not<00:05:00.150> exactly<00:05:00.630> automated

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
going and so it's not exactly automated

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.460 
going and so it's not exactly automated
because<00:05:01.560> generally<00:05:02.720> you'll<00:05:03.720> have<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.080> reset

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
because generally you'll have to reset

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.189 
because generally you'll have to reset
these<00:05:04.650> things<00:05:05.010> up<00:05:05.310> they<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.300> stop<00:05:06.840> they

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
these things up they like to stop they

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.350 
these things up they like to stop they
don't<00:05:07.410> they're<00:05:07.590> not<00:05:07.620> very<00:05:07.889> reliable<00:05:08.340> like<00:05:09.210> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
don't they're not very reliable like I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.120 
don't they're not very reliable like I
said<00:05:09.570> you<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.870> go<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:10.139> an<00:05:10.350> unloaded<00:05:10.740> chunk<00:05:11.010> and

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
said you can go to an unloaded chunk and

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.230 
said you can go to an unloaded chunk and
then<00:05:11.250> you'll<00:05:11.370> come<00:05:11.550> back<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.910> they<00:05:11.970> won't<00:05:12.150> be

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
then you'll come back and they won't be

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.659 
then you'll come back and they won't be
spinning<00:05:12.660> around<00:05:12.750> anymore<00:05:13.310> see<00:05:14.310> look<00:05:14.490> they

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
spinning around anymore see look they

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.490 
spinning around anymore see look they
just<00:05:14.850> got<00:05:14.970> out<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.120> sync<00:05:15.449> right<00:05:15.660> there<00:05:15.960> and

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
just got out of sync right there and

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.439 
just got out of sync right there and
yeah<00:05:17.370> now<00:05:17.550> they're<00:05:17.669> going<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.030> opposite

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
yeah now they're going the opposite

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.500 
yeah now they're going the opposite
direction<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:19.789> generally<00:05:20.789> you<00:05:20.820> will<00:05:21.090> have<00:05:21.330> to

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
direction so generally you will have to

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.480 
direction so generally you will have to
manually<00:05:21.870> reset<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:22.620> every<00:05:22.740> time<00:05:23.100> you<00:05:23.220> want<00:05:23.400> to

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
manually reset it every time you want to

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.200 
manually reset it every time you want to
use<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:24.530> but<00:05:25.530> for<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.770> quick<00:05:26.070> track<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.729> send<00:05:27.000> you

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
use it but for a quick track to send you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.810 
use it but for a quick track to send you
one<00:05:27.539> thousand<00:05:27.960> blocks<00:05:28.199> away<00:05:28.590> say<00:05:29.340> if<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.580> were

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
one thousand blocks away say if you were

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.420 
one thousand blocks away say if you were
pulling<00:05:30.150> villagers<00:05:30.900> in<00:05:31.169> or<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:31.889> you<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.010> had

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
pulling villagers in or if you just had

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.610 
pulling villagers in or if you just had
point<00:05:33.000> A<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.210> point<00:05:33.419> B<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.870> had<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.080> get<00:05:34.410> in

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
point A and point B you had to get in

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.360 
point A and point B you had to get in
between<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.400> didn't<00:05:35.729> have<00:05:36.599> to<00:05:36.960> worry

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
between and you didn't have to worry

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.379 
between and you didn't have to worry
let's<00:05:38.370> say<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:38.550> didn't<00:05:38.789> have<00:05:38.880> enough<00:05:38.970> gold

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
let's say you didn't have enough gold

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.180 
let's say you didn't have enough gold
you<00:05:39.870> could<00:05:40.020> just<00:05:40.200> set<00:05:40.349> one<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.620> these<00:05:40.650> up<00:05:41.039> and

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
you could just set one of these up and

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.100 
you could just set one of these up and
save<00:05:41.550> all<00:05:41.729> your<00:05:41.760> gold<00:05:42.180> for<00:05:42.539> whatever<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.960> heck

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
save all your gold for whatever the heck

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.719 
save all your gold for whatever the heck
you<00:05:43.139> happen<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.710> need<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.979> gold<00:05:44.130> for<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.460> don't

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
you happen to need the gold for I don't

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.850 
you happen to need the gold for I don't
know<00:05:44.880> maybe<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:46.289> just<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.770> be

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
know maybe you just like to be

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.740 
know maybe you just like to be
extravagant<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.669> walk<00:05:47.880> around<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:48.479> gold

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
extravagant and walk around and gold

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.700 
extravagant and walk around and gold
boots<00:05:49.340> but<00:05:50.510> it<00:05:51.510> I<00:05:51.780> think<00:05:52.080> it's<00:05:52.229> pretty<00:05:52.410> neat

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
boots but it I think it's pretty neat

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.159 
boots but it I think it's pretty neat
that<00:05:52.889> this<00:05:53.039> still<00:05:53.340> works<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:53.910> I<00:05:54.630> think<00:05:54.990> with

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
that this still works and I think with

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.960 
that this still works and I think with
golden<00:05:55.590> rails<00:05:55.919> people<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:56.550> completely

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
golden rails people just completely

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.830 
golden rails people just completely
forgot<00:05:57.479> about<00:05:57.720> glitch<00:05:58.380> boosters<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.810> I

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
forgot about glitch boosters so I

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.110 
forgot about glitch boosters so I
thought<00:06:01.229> I<00:06:01.470> just<00:06:01.710> you<00:06:02.190> know<00:06:02.220> pull<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:02.789> video
