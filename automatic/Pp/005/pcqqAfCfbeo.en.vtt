00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.870 
is in perfect line with the rest of her
spine<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.410> what<00:00:19.410> she's<00:00:19.590> gonna<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.310> try<00:00:20.849> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
spine and what she's gonna do is try to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.599 
spine and what she's gonna do is try to
keep<00:00:21.210> her<00:00:21.570> elbows<00:00:22.050> locked<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.009> she's

keep her elbows locked out and she's
going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.000> push<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> floor<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
going to push into the floor so that the

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.900 
going to push into the floor so that the
shoulder<00:00:26.400> blades<00:00:26.429> come<00:00:27.000> away<00:00:27.810> from<00:00:28.140> her<00:00:28.320> spine

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
shoulder blades come away from her spine

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.640 
shoulder blades come away from her spine
so<00:00:29.910> she'll<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.509> of<00:00:30.660> arch<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:31.499> bit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so she'll kind of arch up a little bit

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.860 
so she'll kind of arch up a little bit
here<00:00:31.980> mm-hmm<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.430> then<00:00:33.120> she'll<00:00:33.390> sink<00:00:33.690> back

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
here mm-hmm and then she'll sink back

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.889 
here mm-hmm and then she'll sink back
down<00:00:33.899> slowly<00:00:34.820> good<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.300> she'll<00:00:36.600> press

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
down slowly good and then she'll press

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.510 
down slowly good and then she'll press
right<00:00:37.320> back<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.640> now<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:40.520> chest

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
right back up now this is not a chest

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
right back up now this is not a chest
exercise<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.750> much<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.039> is<00:00:45.440> working<00:00:46.440> the

exercise as much as it is working the
shoulder<00:00:46.890> blade<00:00:47.070> muscle<00:00:47.489> called<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shoulder blade muscle called the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.689 
shoulder blade muscle called the
serratus<00:00:48.239> anterior<00:00:48.859> so<00:00:49.859> she's<00:00:50.160> trying<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
serratus anterior so she's trying to

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
serratus anterior so she's trying to
really<00:00:51.000> push<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.890> protract<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.250> scapula<00:00:54.180> away

from<00:00:55.350> her<00:00:55.500> spine<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.340> together<00:00:58.039> now<00:00:59.039> as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
from her spine and then together now as

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
from her spine and then together now as
you<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.670> stronger<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.929> want<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> try<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> hold

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you get stronger you want to try to hold

you get stronger you want to try to hold
that<00:01:01.859> top<00:01:02.250> position<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.120> shoulder

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.280 

make<00:01:08.460> sure<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.270> go<00:01:09.509> back<00:01:09.750> down<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
make sure as you go back down that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
make sure as you go back down that
you're<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.560> sinking<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> small<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you're not sinking in the small of the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
you're not sinking in the small of the
back<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.080> shoulder<00:01:13.259> blades

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
back it's just the shoulder blades

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
back it's just the shoulder blades
moving<00:01:14.869> beautiful<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.729> stronger<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
moving beautiful as you get stronger you

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
moving beautiful as you get stronger you
can<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> harder<00:01:19.680> by<00:01:19.860> walking<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.520> arms

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can make it harder by walking your arms

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.510 
can make it harder by walking your arms
away<00:01:21.150> from<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.840> knees<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:23.009> you're<00:01:23.159> more<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
away from your knees so you're more in a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.600 
away from your knees so you're more in a
modified<00:01:23.939> push-up<00:01:24.240> position<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
modified push-up position and then you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
modified push-up position and then you
can<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> same<00:01:27.240> exercise<00:01:27.500> shoulder<00:01:28.500> blades

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
can do the same exercise shoulder blades

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
can do the same exercise shoulder blades
away<00:01:30.500> slow<00:01:31.500> together<00:01:32.360> try<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> hold<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> top

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
away slow together try to hold the top

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.969 
away slow together try to hold the top
part<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.470> longer

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.469 

good<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> slowly<00:01:38.549> sink<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.360> you're

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
good and slowly sink down so you're

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.670 
good and slowly sink down so you're
really<00:01:39.630> controlling<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:42.259> right<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.469> up

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
really controlling it and right back up

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.880 
really controlling it and right back up
and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.479> make<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> even<00:01:45.899> harder<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.740> can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and then to make it even harder you can

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.510 
and then to make it even harder you can
get<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.610> regular<00:01:48.060> push-up<00:01:48.329> position<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
get into a regular push-up position and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.870 
get into a regular push-up position and
do<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> same<00:01:50.909> exercise<00:01:52.280> keep<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.460> elbows

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
do the same exercise keep your elbows

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.800 
do the same exercise keep your elbows
locked<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.450> there's<00:01:54.750> no<00:01:55.020> bend<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> elbows

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
locked out there's no bend in the elbows

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.640 
locked out there's no bend in the elbows
that's<00:01:57.810> it

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.130 

now<00:02:01.650> as<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.310> even<00:02:02.700> stronger<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.690> can<00:02:03.720> do

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
now as you get even stronger you can do

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.940 
now as you get even stronger you can do
what's<00:02:05.100> called<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.460> push-up<00:02:05.850> plus<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.470> go
