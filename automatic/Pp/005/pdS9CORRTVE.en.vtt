completely makes up for it it looks

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.640 
completely makes up for it it looks
completely<00:00:34.940> different<00:00:35.600> from<00:00:35.840> resistance<00:00:36.380> 1

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
completely different from resistance 1

completely different from resistance 1
and<00:00:36.950> 2<00:00:37.250> which<00:00:37.790> isn't<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.690> bad<00:00:38.720> thing<00:00:38.870> resistant

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.420 
one and two look great in their own
merits<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.350> at<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.860> time<00:00:42.890> they<00:00:43.400> were

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
merits and at the time they were

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.330 
merits and at the time they were
released<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.650> insomniac<00:00:45.650> is<00:00:45.860> pushing<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
released but insomniac is pushing the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.270 
released but insomniac is pushing the
limits<00:00:46.640> I'm<00:00:47.180> very<00:00:48.110> impressed<00:00:48.470> with<00:00:48.830> what<00:00:49.190> I'm

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
limits I'm very impressed with what I'm

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.360 
limits I'm very impressed with what I'm
seeing<00:00:49.310> here<00:00:50.620> but<00:00:51.620> let's<00:00:51.800> go<00:00:51.950> on<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
seeing here but let's go on to the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.040 
seeing here but let's go on to the
details<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.910> mean<00:00:53.120> there<00:00:53.510> isn't<00:00:53.690> really<00:00:53.930> much

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
details I mean there isn't really much

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.500 
details I mean there isn't really much
we<00:00:54.470> can<00:00:54.620> make<00:00:54.740> out<00:00:54.920> of<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.130> area<00:00:55.330> there<00:00:56.330> is<00:00:56.480> a

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
we can make out of the area there is a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.750 
we can make out of the area there is a
diner<00:00:56.810> and<00:00:57.110> some<00:00:57.230> derelict<00:00:57.530> school<00:00:57.770> buses<00:00:58.100> but

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
diner and some derelict school buses but

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.520 
diner and some derelict school buses but
the<00:00:59.150> most<00:00:59.270> interesting<00:00:59.540> point<00:00:59.990> is<00:01:00.200> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the most interesting point is the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.080 
the most interesting point is the
syllable<00:01:00.890> structure<00:01:01.160> on<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> horizon<00:01:01.580> which

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
syllable structure on the horizon which

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.460 
syllable structure on the horizon which
looks<00:01:02.420> similar<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.020> structures<00:01:03.350> we've

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
looks similar to the structures we've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.010 
looks similar to the structures we've
seen<00:01:03.740> before<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.220> previous<00:01:04.340> games<00:01:05.020> it

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
seen before in the previous games it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.770 
seen before in the previous games it
does<00:01:06.410> somewhat<00:01:07.100> seem<00:01:07.880> debris<00:01:08.210> reminiscence

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
does somewhat seem debris reminiscence

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.180 
does somewhat seem debris reminiscence
of<00:01:08.870> half-life<00:01:09.290> 2<00:01:09.500> for<00:01:09.680> those<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.040> know

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
of half-life 2 for those of you know

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.720 
of half-life 2 for those of you know
that<00:01:10.400> I'm<00:01:10.520> talking<00:01:10.880> about<00:01:10.910> but<00:01:11.510> otherwise<00:01:12.730> it

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
that I'm talking about but otherwise it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.700 
that I'm talking about but otherwise it
seems<00:01:14.180> like<00:01:14.390> there's<00:01:14.570> something<00:01:14.900> going<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.260> it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
seems like there's something going on it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.060 
seems like there's something going on it
seems<00:01:15.920> like<00:01:16.160> it's<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.580> power<00:01:16.760> structure<00:01:17.090> um

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
seems like it's a power structure um

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.160 
seems like it's a power structure um
from<00:01:19.070> those<00:01:19.550> of<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.760> know<00:01:19.910> that<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.870> ending

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
from those of you know that the ending

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.530 
from those of you know that the ending
from<00:01:21.260> resistance<00:01:21.800> to<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.640> could<00:01:22.850> try

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
from resistance to you could try

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.820 
from resistance to you could try
figuring<00:01:24.110> out<00:01:24.290> what<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.340> may<00:01:25.730> be<00:01:26.050> but<00:01:27.050> there

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
figuring out what it may be but there

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.540 
figuring out what it may be but there
really<00:01:28.160> isn't<00:01:28.430> much<00:01:28.610> we<00:01:28.730> can<00:01:28.880> make<00:01:29.120> out<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.330> it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
really isn't much we can make out of it

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.980 
really isn't much we can make out of it
moving<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.700> now<00:01:32.000> we<00:01:32.060> see<00:01:32.330> some<00:01:32.540> resistance

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
moving on now we see some resistance

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.410 
moving on now we see some resistance
soldiers<00:01:33.320> coming<00:01:33.650> out<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.250> fight<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.760> wave

of<00:01:35.630> chimera<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.409> time<00:01:36.650> we<00:01:36.980> won't<00:01:37.130> be<00:01:37.310> playing

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
of chimera this time we won't be playing

if you got the resistance to
you'll<00:01:41.570> know<00:01:41.690> why<00:01:42.460> let's<00:01:43.460> stop<00:01:43.640> here<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:43.940> oh

which<00:01:53.000> will<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:53.420> pretty<00:01:53.780> interesting<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.290> see

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
which will be pretty interesting to see

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530 
which will be pretty interesting to see
how<00:01:54.770> dynamic<00:01:55.040> they<00:01:55.520> will<00:01:55.730> be<00:01:56.030> within<00:01:56.330> the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
how dynamic they will be within the

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.570 
how dynamic they will be within the
environment<00:01:56.840> they<00:01:57.260> are<00:01:57.530> in<00:02:00.070> here<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:01.280> see<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
environment they are in here we see the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.920 
environment they are in here we see the
standard<00:02:01.910> crime<00:02:02.090> area<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.480> have<00:02:02.600> been<00:02:02.720> found

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
standard crime area that have been found

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.350 
standard crime area that have been found
throughout<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.380> series<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.040> as<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.120> moving

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
throughout the series and as we moving

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.150 
throughout the series and as we moving
the<00:02:05.450> first<00:02:05.630> person<00:02:06.050> mode<00:02:06.170> you'll<00:02:06.500> notice<00:02:06.980> once

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
the first person mode you'll notice once

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.000 
the first person mode you'll notice once
again<00:02:07.430> how<00:02:07.700> great<00:02:08.510> this<00:02:08.690> game<00:02:08.929> looks<00:02:09.170> but

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
again how great this game looks but

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.100 
again how great this game looks but
that's<00:02:10.429> not<00:02:10.550> all<00:02:10.790> let's<00:02:11.180> pause<00:02:11.720> here<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:11.960> a

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that's not all let's pause here for a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050 
that's not all let's pause here for a
moment<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.440> take<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.590> look<00:02:12.770> at<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> HUD<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.280> you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
moment and take a look at the HUD as you

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.450 
moment and take a look at the HUD as you
can<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.480> seems<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.250> insomniac<00:02:16.250> has

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
can see it seems like a insomniac has

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.400 
can see it seems like a insomniac has
returned<00:02:16.910> back<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.630> serious<00:02:17.930> roots<00:02:18.170> and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
returned back to the serious roots and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.260 
returned back to the serious roots and
we<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> standard<00:02:19.640> health<00:02:19.850> bar<00:02:20.060> again

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
we now have a standard health bar again

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.140 
we now have a standard health bar again
this<00:02:21.230> definitely<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.770> welcomed<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:22.520> many<00:02:22.880> fans

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this definitely is welcomed as many fans

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.240 
this definitely is welcomed as many fans
including<00:02:23.450> me<00:02:23.959> felt<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.410> regenerated<00:02:24.980> health

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
including me felt the regenerated health

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.880 
including me felt the regenerated health
system<00:02:25.640> was<00:02:25.820> quite<00:02:26.660> unnecessary<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.290> mean<00:02:27.590> it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
system was quite unnecessary I mean it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.110 
system was quite unnecessary I mean it
was<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:29.500> design<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:30.860> been<00:02:31.190> overused<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
was a design that's been overused and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.170 
was a design that's been overused and
resistance<00:02:32.690> definitely<00:02:33.380> did<00:02:33.500> not<00:02:33.650> need<00:02:33.890> it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
resistance definitely did not need it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.760 
resistance definitely did not need it
and<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.630> see<00:02:35.660> here<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.320> seems<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
and as you can see here it seems the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.130 
and as you can see here it seems the
Chimera<00:02:37.130> can<00:02:37.280> explode<00:02:37.580> after<00:02:37.790> death<00:02:38.140> most

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
Chimera can explode after death most

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.390 
Chimera can explode after death most
likely<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.470> malfunction<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.160> equipment

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
likely a malfunction in the equipment

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.310 
likely a malfunction in the equipment
that<00:02:40.670> keeps<00:02:40.880> your<00:02:41.000> body<00:02:41.180> school<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.810> don't

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
that keeps your body school I don't

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.100 
that keeps your body school I don't
remember<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:43.280> happening<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.870> past

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
remember this happening in the past

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.590 
remember this happening in the past
games

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.790 

now<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.200> probably<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> best<00:02:49.710> thing

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
now this is probably the best thing

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.250 
now this is probably the best thing
about<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> trailer<00:02:50.360> yeah<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.780> weapon<00:02:52.110> wheel

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
about the trailer yeah the weapon wheel

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.170 
about the trailer yeah the weapon wheel
it<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:53.160> completely<00:02:53.670> left<00:02:53.940> out<00:02:54.060> from

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
it was completely left out from

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.550 
it was completely left out from
resistance<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.080> was<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> huge

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
resistance to and that was a huge

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.050 
resistance to and that was a huge
disappointment<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.670> definitely<00:02:56.880> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
disappointment but it's definitely a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.350 
disappointment but it's definitely a
heartwarming<00:02:57.450> return<00:02:57.960> in<00:02:58.260> resistance<00:02:59.190> 3<00:02:59.430> we

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
heartwarming return in resistance 3 we

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000 
heartwarming return in resistance 3 we
can<00:03:00.480> see<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> Magnum<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.170> resistance<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.770> is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
can see the Magnum for resistance to is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.860 
can see the Magnum for resistance to is
there<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.430> well<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> classic<00:03:03.360> such<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
there as well as a classic such as the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.230 
there as well as a classic such as the
auger<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> bullseye<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.790> forgot<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
auger the bullseye and I forgot to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.730 
auger the bullseye and I forgot to
mention<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.540> but<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.230> take<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> few

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
mention this but if you take a few

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.290 
mention this but if you take a few
seconds<00:03:08.070> behind<00:03:08.190> you'll<00:03:08.640> see<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> chimera

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
seconds behind you'll see a chimera

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.180 
seconds behind you'll see a chimera
using<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> auger<00:03:09.960> secondary<00:03:10.500> fire<00:03:10.770> which

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
using the auger secondary fire which

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.640 
using the auger secondary fire which
creates<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.670> shield<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:13.320> sure<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
creates a shield not sure if the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.900 
creates a shield not sure if the
Marchman<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.190> same<00:03:14.370> revel<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.790> we've

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
Marchman is the same revel that we've

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.220 
Marchman is the same revel that we've
seen<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.180> last<00:03:15.240> two<00:03:15.570> games<00:03:15.840> since<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
seen in the last two games since the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.470 
seen in the last two games since the
design<00:03:16.650> looks<00:03:16.980> much<00:03:17.430> different<00:03:17.460> or<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.090> from

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
design looks much different or not from

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.230 
design looks much different or not from
what<00:03:18.780> I've<00:03:18.960> remembered<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.740> we<00:03:20.700> take<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.090> that

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
what I've remembered if we take it that

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.360 
what I've remembered if we take it that
this<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.600> final<00:03:21.900> design<00:03:22.050> for<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.410> wheel<00:03:22.620> I

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
this is the final design for the wheel I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.550 
this is the final design for the wheel I
guess<00:03:24.210> it's<00:03:24.390> safe<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.600> assume<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.230> there

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
guess it's safe to assume that there

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.220 
guess it's safe to assume that there
will<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.860> 12<00:03:26.340> unique<00:03:26.760> weapons<00:03:27.210> for<00:03:27.390> us<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.960> play

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
will be 12 unique weapons for us to play

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.170 
will be 12 unique weapons for us to play
with<00:03:28.590> each<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:29.010> their<00:03:29.160> own<00:03:29.340> alternate<00:03:29.820> firing

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
with each of their own alternate firing

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.480 
with each of their own alternate firing
modes<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.600> knowing<00:03:31.470> how<00:03:31.620> creative<00:03:32.040> insomnia

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
modes and knowing how creative insomnia

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.430 
modes and knowing how creative insomnia
can<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.880> with<00:03:33.570> their<00:03:33.720> toys<00:03:33.870> I'm<00:03:34.110> eagerly

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
can be with their toys I'm eagerly

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.190 
can be with their toys I'm eagerly
waiting<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.800> find<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.660> though<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.900> biggest

waiting to find out though the biggest
thing<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.440> notice<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.580> seems<00:03:38.850> that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
thing to notice is that it seems that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.450 
thing to notice is that it seems that
now<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.210> can<00:03:39.420> level<00:03:39.690> up<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:39.840> weapons<00:03:40.340> if<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
now you can level up your weapons if you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.880 
now you can level up your weapons if you
take<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.670> look<00:03:41.760> under<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.150> bullseye<00:03:42.690> teams<00:03:43.500> to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
take a look under the bullseye teams to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.580 
take a look under the bullseye teams to
have<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.310> level<00:03:44.610> 1<00:03:44.820> marc-andre<00:03:45.240> not<00:03:46.200> interested

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
have a level 1 marc-andre not interested

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.960 
have a level 1 marc-andre not interested
to<00:03:46.620> see<00:03:46.800> how<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.040> system<00:03:47.400> will<00:03:47.550> work<00:03:47.580> and

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
to see how the system will work and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.550 
to see how the system will work and
whether<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.360> will<00:03:48.480> make<00:03:48.660> its<00:03:48.840> way<00:03:49.140> onto<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
whether it will make its way onto the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.600 
whether it will make its way onto the
multiplayer<00:03:50.040> portion<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.670> game<00:03:52.610> let's

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
multiplayer portion of the game let's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.390 
multiplayer portion of the game let's
pause<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:53.850> once<00:03:54.300> again<00:03:54.390> you'll<00:03:55.200> notice<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
pause here once again you'll notice the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.640 
pause here once again you'll notice the
bullseye<00:03:56.760> iron<00:03:57.030> sights<00:03:57.360> have<00:03:57.630> seemed<00:03:58.380> to

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
bullseye iron sights have seemed to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.400 
bullseye iron sights have seemed to
improve<00:03:59.209> but<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.300> most<00:04:00.390> intriguing<00:04:00.750> part<00:04:01.200> is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
improve but the most intriguing part is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.380 
improve but the most intriguing part is
the<00:04:01.650> HUD<00:04:01.800> once<00:04:02.070> again<00:04:02.340> if<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.970> take<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> look<00:04:03.330> at

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the HUD once again if you take a look at

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.640 
the HUD once again if you take a look at
the<00:04:03.450> bottom<00:04:03.720> right<00:04:03.750> you'll<00:04:04.050> notice<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.350> grenade

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
the bottom right you'll notice a grenade

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.949 
the bottom right you'll notice a grenade
icon<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.310> next<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.090> are<00:04:06.270> three<00:04:06.510> more<00:04:06.660> slots

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
icon and next to it are three more slots

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.860 
icon and next to it are three more slots
so<00:04:07.830> I<00:04:08.130> guess<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.520> can<00:04:08.640> assume<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.330> insomnia

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
so I guess we can assume that insomnia

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.449 
so I guess we can assume that insomnia
is<00:04:10.110> definitely<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> amount<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.040> secondary

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
is definitely up the amount of secondary

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.510 
is definitely up the amount of secondary
weapons<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.060> few<00:04:12.870> seconds<00:04:13.290> we'll<00:04:14.070> see<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
weapons a few seconds we'll see the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.660 
weapons a few seconds we'll see the
bullseye<00:04:14.790> working<00:04:15.090> its<00:04:15.240> magic

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
bullseye working its magic

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.610 
bullseye working its magic
it's<00:04:15.880> often<00:04:16.690> fire<00:04:16.930> well<00:04:17.799> becca

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.710 

last<00:04:22.220> but<00:04:22.400> not<00:04:22.430> least<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:23.180> see<00:04:23.210> another<00:04:23.540> new

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
last but not least you see another new

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.900 
last but not least you see another new
Camaro<00:04:24.169> which<00:04:24.530> seems<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.979> resemble<00:04:25.340> what<00:04:25.790> I'd

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
Camaro which seems to resemble what I'd

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.689 
Camaro which seems to resemble what I'd
like<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.240> call<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.449> mutated<00:04:27.110> juggernaut<00:04:27.699> I'll

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
like to call a mutated juggernaut I'll

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:29.890 
like to call a mutated juggernaut I'll
be<00:04:28.790> pretty<00:04:29.000> interesting<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.510> see<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
be pretty interesting to see if the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.300 
be pretty interesting to see if the
Chimera<00:04:30.229> get<00:04:30.380> any<00:04:30.530> bigger<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:30.919> the<00:04:31.010> way<00:04:31.130> they

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
Chimera get any bigger like the way they

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.180 
Chimera get any bigger like the way they
did<00:04:31.699> in<00:04:31.970> resistance<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:33.320> that's<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.160> for

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
did in resistance to so that's it for

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.760 
did in resistance to so that's it for
the<00:04:34.550> resistance<00:04:35.120> 3<00:04:35.360> extraction<00:04:36.020> looks<00:04:36.560> like

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the resistance 3 extraction looks like

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.879 
the resistance 3 extraction looks like
it's<00:04:37.070> going<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.610> be<00:04:37.820> even<00:04:38.120> a<00:04:38.510> better<00:04:38.810> game<00:04:39.199> from

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
it's going to be even a better game from

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.189 
it's going to be even a better game from
resistance<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.699> seems<00:04:41.300> like<00:04:41.449> insomniac<00:04:42.050> is

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
resistance to seems like insomniac is

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.960 
resistance to seems like insomniac is
definitely<00:04:42.590> listening<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.070> its<00:04:43.220> fanbase<00:04:43.460> and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
definitely listening to its fanbase and

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
definitely listening to its fanbase and
that's<00:04:44.389> something<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.720> we<00:04:45.020> don't<00:04:45.260> see<00:04:45.650> many

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
that's something that we don't see many

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.450 
that's something that we don't see many
developers<00:04:46.490> put<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.360> lot<00:04:47.660> of<00:04:47.690> effort<00:04:48.080> into

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
developers put a lot of effort into

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.040 
developers put a lot of effort into
there<00:04:49.460> are<00:04:49.699> developers<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.810> but

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
there are developers that do so but

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.840 
there are developers that do so but
insomniac<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.860> really<00:04:52.280> taking<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.760> the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
insomniac is really taking it to the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.020 
insomniac is really taking it to the
next<00:04:52.940> level<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:54.490> seems<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.669> it's<00:04:55.850> going<00:04:55.970> to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
next level it seems like it's going to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.050 
next level it seems like it's going to
be<00:04:56.150> just<00:04:56.539> as<00:04:56.780> good<00:04:56.990> as<00:04:57.229> fall<00:04:57.470> man<00:04:57.910> dare<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:58.940> say

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
be just as good as fall man dare I say

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.690 
be just as good as fall man dare I say
it<00:04:59.270> even<00:04:59.419> better
