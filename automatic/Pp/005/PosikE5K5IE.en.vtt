00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.940
 cabinet solution mixed with 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.430

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.750
 swing door with an open solution 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 up an open solution in which 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.610
 We can put and store the boxes 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.610
 things that we do not use so often
