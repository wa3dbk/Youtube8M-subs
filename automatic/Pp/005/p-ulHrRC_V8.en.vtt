ground station built trying to speak a

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.350 
ground station built trying to speak a
bit<00:00:06.839> louder<00:00:07.020> because<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:08.519> previous<00:00:08.880> video<00:00:09.179> my

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
bit louder because the previous video my

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.020 
bit louder because the previous video my

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.630 
here am i connected to sir example here
I<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.849> nicely<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.660> neatly<00:00:30.869> connect<00:00:31.640> my

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I can nicely and neatly connect my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.720 
I can nicely and neatly connect my
go-go's<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.200> this<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> military<00:00:35.130> great

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
go-go's here this one a military great

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
go-go's here this one a military great
connector<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.899> rugged<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
connector they are very rugged and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.760 
connector they are very rugged and
recognizable<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:39.570> stop<00:00:39.780> them<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> then

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
recognizable you stop them in and then

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
recognizable you stop them in and then
they<00:00:41.010> come<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> lock<00:00:41.760> nut<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> beauty

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
they come with a lock nut so the beauty

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.840 
they come with a lock nut so the beauty
is<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:43.920> cannot<00:00:44.190> pull<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.700> out

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
is that you really cannot pull them out

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.020 
is that you really cannot pull them out
and<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.750> good<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.110> field<00:00:46.350> operation

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and it's really good for field operation

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
and it's really good for field operation
now<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.690> important<00:00:49.079> part<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
now the more important part here are the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.310 
now the more important part here are the
two<00:00:50.489> trackers<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> built<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.170> have

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
two trackers that I built so we have

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
two trackers that I built so we have
here<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.930> 433<00:00:54.930> megahertz<00:00:55.649> 6<00:00:56.370> element

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
here one for the 433 megahertz 6 element

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
here one for the 433 megahertz 6 element
Yankee<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.859> another<00:00:59.070> one

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Yankee and over here we have another one

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.910 
Yankee and over here we have another one
which<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> 1210<00:01:00.570> helico<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.410> 1.2

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
which is the 1210 helico for 1.2

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.929 
which is the 1210 helico for 1.2
gigahertz<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:03.570> trick<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
gigahertz the trick here is now that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.000 
gigahertz the trick here is now that
that<00:01:05.939> these<00:01:06.510> antennas<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.439> well

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that these antennas here are well

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.429 
that these antennas here are well
balanced<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> antenna<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
balanced so we have here the antenna and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
balanced so we have here the antenna and
a<00:01:10.500> counterweight<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.299> matter<00:01:12.510> how

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
a counterweight and so no matter how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
a counterweight and so no matter how
you've<00:01:12.900> positioned<00:01:13.110> them<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:14.010> were<00:01:14.159> really

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you've positioned them they were really

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
you've positioned them they were really
stay<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.729> their<00:01:15.000> position<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> put<00:01:15.869> no<00:01:16.020> load

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stay in their position and put no load

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
stay in their position and put no load
on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.619> service<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.220> means<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.090> reduce<00:01:18.270> our

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
on the service which means we reduce our

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
on the service which means we reduce our
current<00:01:19.140> draw<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> battery<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.400> for

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
current draw from the battery and for

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.359 
current draw from the battery and for
long<00:01:21.180> operation<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> show<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
long operation now I want to show you is

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.880 
long operation now I want to show you is
how<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> setup<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> range<00:01:25.680> with

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
how we do the setup for the range with

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
how we do the setup for the range with
your<00:01:26.040> ground<00:01:26.250> station<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.420> gonna

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
your ground station so I'm just gonna

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
your ground station so I'm just gonna
run<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> set<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> adjust<00:01:29.040> my

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
run that set up and adjust my

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.450 
run that set up and adjust my
counterclockwise<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.509> clockwise<00:01:30.570> angles

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
counterclockwise and clockwise angles

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
counterclockwise and clockwise angles
let's<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:34.460> ok<00:01:35.460> first<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> set<00:01:36.960> my

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
let's go at it ok first I have to set my

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.319 
let's go at it ok first I have to set my
counterclockwise<00:01:37.950> swing<00:01:38.520> direction<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
counterclockwise swing direction so it's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:49.550 
counterclockwise swing direction so it's
like<00:01:39.600> 90<00:01:40.530> degrees<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> direction<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
like 90 degrees in this direction the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
like 90 degrees in this direction the
next<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.399> counter<00:01:50.759> clockwise<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
next thing is my counter clockwise so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510 
next thing is my counter clockwise so
right<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.020> should<00:01:52.049> swing<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
right now they should swing in this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.990 
right now they should swing in this
direction

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.999 

again<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.360> fine-tune<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.170> offset<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.799> say

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
again I can fine-tune the offset and say

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.370 
again I can fine-tune the offset and say
about<00:02:01.810> about<00:02:02.810> this<00:02:03.049> much<00:02:04.990> then<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.170> next

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
about about this much then the next

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.550 
about about this much then the next
thing<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.619> can<00:02:06.830> do<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.189> is<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.820> can<00:02:08.810> adjust<00:02:09.470> my

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
thing I can do here is I can adjust my

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:37.300 
thing I can do here is I can adjust my
servos<00:02:10.250> zero<00:02:35.049> okay

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
servos zero okay

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.390 
servos zero okay
now<00:02:38.269> we<00:02:38.330> can<00:02:38.600> already<00:02:38.750> start<00:02:39.310> trying<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
now we can already start trying to

00:02:40.400 --> 00:03:00.450 
now we can already start trying to
adjust<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.910> speed

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.770 

that<00:03:01.460> would<00:03:01.610> not<00:03:01.730> mean<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.030> our<00:03:02.180> setup<00:03:02.660> is

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
that would not mean that our setup is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.510 
that would not mean that our setup is
now<00:03:02.900> complete<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.710> we<00:03:03.770> go<00:03:04.010> back<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
now complete and we go back to the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.730 
now complete and we go back to the
sender<00:03:04.790> no<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.080> interesting<00:03:06.590> to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
sender no it was not so interesting to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:19.360 
sender no it was not so interesting to
see<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.810> depending<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:10.210> manually<00:03:11.210> select<00:03:18.370> so

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
see that depending on manually select so

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.440 
see that depending on manually select so
this<00:03:19.520> is<00:03:19.670> here<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.660> pending<00:03:21.050> speed<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
this is here just the pending speed it

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.110 
this is here just the pending speed it
is<00:03:23.500> not<00:03:24.500> too<00:03:24.650> fast<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.190> not<00:03:25.280> too<00:03:25.340> slow<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.730> think

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
is not too fast and not too slow I think

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.500 
is not too fast and not too slow I think
is<00:03:26.210> actually<00:03:26.570> pretty<00:03:26.810> ideal<00:03:28.360> we<00:03:29.360> don't

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
is actually pretty ideal we don't

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.010 
is actually pretty ideal we don't
overload<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:29.990> servos<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:32.240> think<00:03:32.870> it's

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
overload the servos and I think it's

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.530 
overload the servos and I think it's
adequate<00:03:33.850> considering<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.180> have<00:03:35.210> here

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
adequate considering that we have here

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.110 
adequate considering that we have here
about<00:03:35.660> an<00:03:36.050> antenna<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.650> about<00:03:36.890> 1.6<00:03:37.700> kilo

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
about an antenna of about 1.6 kilo

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
about an antenna of about 1.6 kilo
including<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.170> counterweights<00:03:39.740> we<00:03:39.950> are

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
including the counterweights we are

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.240 
including the counterweights we are
easily<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.640> to<00:03:41.150> win<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.300> half<00:03:41.510> kilo<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.710> think

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
easily it to win a half kilo so I think

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.100 
easily it to win a half kilo so I think
the<00:03:43.430> space<00:03:43.910> spinning<00:03:44.390> speed<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.690> little

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the space spinning speed a little

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.840 
the space spinning speed a little
tightening<00:03:45.470> mass<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.830> quite<00:03:46.070> high<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.460> with

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
tightening mass is quite high and with

00:03:46.850 --> 00:04:11.320 
tightening mass is quite high and with
that<00:03:47.000> speed<00:04:08.980> one<00:04:09.980> trick<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.550> really<00:04:10.940> that

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
that speed one trick that I really that

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.060 
that speed one trick that I really that
took<00:04:11.510> me<00:04:11.660> quite<00:04:11.810> some<00:04:12.260> time<00:04:12.709> are<00:04:12.950> these

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
took me quite some time are these

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.940 
took me quite some time are these

that<00:04:56.900> these<00:04:57.020> trackers<00:04:57.710> here<00:04:57.919> are<00:04:58.100> built<00:04:58.310> by

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
that these trackers here are built by

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.959 
that these trackers here are built by
using<00:04:58.910> Windsor<00:04:59.570> was<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.960> key<00:05:00.140> element<00:05:00.169> so

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
using Windsor was the key element so

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.829 
using Windsor was the key element so
we<00:05:00.999> have<00:05:01.149> here<00:05:02.489> 1200<00:05:03.489> I<00:05:03.849> think<00:05:04.119> 60<00:05:04.509> degrees

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:04.839 
we have here 1200 I think 60 degrees

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.899 
we have here 1200 I think 60 degrees
rotation<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.919> this<00:05:06.069> one<00:05:06.249> he<00:05:06.339> has<00:05:06.429> now<00:05:06.579> geared

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
rotation and this one he has now geared

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.689 
rotation and this one he has now geared
down<00:05:07.119> using<00:05:07.569> also<00:05:07.869> what<00:05:08.289> city<00:05:08.589> parts<00:05:08.889> so<00:05:09.579> the

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
down using also what city parts so the

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.149 
down using also what city parts so the
tractor<00:05:10.059> is<00:05:10.209> actually<00:05:10.629> very<00:05:10.989> precise<00:05:11.439> very

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
tractor is actually very precise very

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.089 
tractor is actually very precise very
small<00:05:12.519> but<00:05:13.089> very<00:05:13.389> powerful<00:05:13.619> so<00:05:14.619> for<00:05:14.799> example

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
small but very powerful so for example

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.729 
small but very powerful so for example
on<00:05:17.610> tilt<00:05:18.610> mechanism<00:05:18.789> we<00:05:19.659> have<00:05:19.689> here<00:05:20.079> about<00:05:20.289> 80

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:20.739 
on tilt mechanism we have here about 80

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:23.100 
on tilt mechanism we have here about 80
kilo<00:05:20.979> gram<00:05:21.279> per<00:05:21.909> centimeter

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
kilo gram per centimeter

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.839 
kilo gram per centimeter
this<00:05:23.499> one<00:05:23.649> has<00:05:23.860> incorporated<00:05:24.159> here<00:05:24.729> by

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
this one has incorporated here by

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.179 
this one has incorporated here by
massive<00:05:25.209> gearing<00:05:25.539> mechanism<00:05:25.569> and<00:05:26.559> this<00:05:27.039> is

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
massive gearing mechanism and this is

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.309 
massive gearing mechanism and this is
how<00:05:27.339> the<00:05:27.399> tractor<00:05:27.789> works<00:05:27.969> okay<00:05:28.749> I<00:05:28.959> hope<00:05:29.139> you

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
how the tractor works okay I hope you

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.739 
how the tractor works okay I hope you
