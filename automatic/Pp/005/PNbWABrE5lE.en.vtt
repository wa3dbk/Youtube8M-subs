00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 from there 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.769
 at least to try 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.179
 the chromatic harmonica the nozzle are two screws one at each location 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.220
 every corner 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 only one turn on a screw 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.819
 another turn in the second to escape 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 to cause the pressure to undo itself equally 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.079
 so now 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.580
 I can not take another few turns 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
 although it fled the first 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.580
 and I'm going to do it for the metal parts 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 I do not expect to continue like this 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.940
 taking off in the agora 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 We can release the wait once. 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 removing the first one to fux to nasa 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.370
 of the mouthpiece first of the second point now of sebum guilt 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.840
 these first bolt screws is very important 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
 what a jerk 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.649
 but it had an important role, we did not lose 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.460
 so close to the place of the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
 close to each other 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.920
 so the boring 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 within the next three months of each 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.960
 If you do not lose, you died. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.680
 the fall of the key 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.080
 up to the room 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.150
 of the rail 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.950
 where it has two doubts nothing the trio that the mouthpiece itself 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 but let's start walking 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 using 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.310
 but slipped when 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.000
 is good 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.750
 There may be people who are afraid of being a brush. 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 now we are going to get the first piece that the plate liesa 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.879
 and let's start the procedure 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 We'll hold on to one end 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
 with the brush only going in one direction 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.379
 out 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.180
 of the plate never make round trip 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.119
 with the same exposed force can cause some damage 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.609
 this mixed plate 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.209
 so no sense in the back I shot her and then passed brush only ever 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.109
 in a sense 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.489
 I went to the other side of the michel plate 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.239
 to continue cleaning now makes me happy and I continued 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
 around the world 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.289
 draw the soap running water 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.789
 removing all the soap now you notice if there is no mother 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.499
 full of fat yet a dirt but the fat 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:10.589
 this lock 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.059
 past the second part 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:18.099
 according to the research we will do was the part of the rail note that it has two 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.879
 lateral folds forming the trio 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.679
 Where will you go? 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:27.809
 the key piece the gang up until then rail sauce formed in amateur work 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.780
 and honey house has to be put upstairs always upstairs 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.969
 It's the same thing 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.419
 passing the brush only in one direction never going back and forth just in the 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.540
 sense passed out came back with the brush passed again 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:46.939
 it has to be 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.399
 well brushed ansa 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.879
 this plate on your plate 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.879
 from the trio 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.249
 there is a current 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.799
 and now verify the same thing you 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.389
 in a world if it does not continue to have some fat 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.819
 never pass 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.099
 the plate but never pass the brush on the side 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.069
 the top of the plate always 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.069
 on the brent and inner side of drugs 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.170
 it's our goal to clean this side 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.300
 where the folds on the outside are not 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.110
 now it passes 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.409
 the apple of criticism that is would think that in spite of the language iata 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.120
 you should never put 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 play this part and try to pass 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.650
 as an angle 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.880
 like marble 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.090
 and you're going to import this party 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.169
 then the big big mistake secret that the placing in mureta 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.659
 into the tub 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.469
 protected from the body 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.949
 but the pair 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.270
 causing it to be completely stuck with a weapon 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.969
 and now sweetness at one end and making 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.219
 our movement out 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.410
 coming back suspending some brushes 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.410
 and making movement 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.360
 Same thing on the other side 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:35.759
 washing in the stream 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.409
 and in the same way verifying 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.360
 cit 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.129
 has no foreign help 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.340
 now the mouthpiece 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.340
 itself 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.629
 the nozzle is tougher you can make this move now roundtrip 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.969
 no problem 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.490
 behind the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.490
 the same thing 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.189
 one person and may have lived mine 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.360
 of this money anyway 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.080
 there is a current
