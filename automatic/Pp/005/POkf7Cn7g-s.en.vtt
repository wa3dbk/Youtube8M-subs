as last year's I think we have a good
class<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.380> quarterbacks<00:02:55.880> obviously<00:02:56.880> no<00:02:57.360> time

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
out and the draft this year or we didn't

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.949 
out and the draft this year or we didn't
have<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> national<00:03:09.000> championship<00:03:09.480> quarterback

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
have a national championship quarterback
