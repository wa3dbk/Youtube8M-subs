00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
local organic meat from scratch I think

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.570 
local organic meat from scratch I think
it<00:00:18.439> could<00:00:18.590> be<00:00:18.619> done

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
it could be done

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.160

think<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:24.890> first<00:00:25.189> step<00:00:25.430> is<00:00:25.849> is<00:00:26.180> believing

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
think the first step is is believing

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:42.190 
think the first step is is believing
that<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:27.500> is<00:00:27.529> possible<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:28.420> we<00:00:29.420> can<00:00:29.570> do<00:00:29.720> it
