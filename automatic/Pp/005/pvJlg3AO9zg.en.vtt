these cards are just extra powers in
conjunction<00:03:03.250> with<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.790> cards<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.930> get

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
conjunction with the cards that you get

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.480 
conjunction with the cards that you get
in<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.980> game<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.590> that's<00:03:08.860> basically<00:03:09.130> it

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
in the game and that's basically it

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.240 
in the game and that's basically it
there<00:03:09.790> are<00:03:09.910> some<00:03:10.090> variants<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:12.870> how<00:03:13.870> you<00:03:14.250> take

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
there are some variants on how you take

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.860 
there are some variants on how you take
the<00:03:15.400> cards<00:03:15.760> you<00:03:15.880> could<00:03:16.090> take<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.360> cards<00:03:16.690> like

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
the cards you could take the cards like

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.050 
the cards you could take the cards like
in<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.110> 71<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.830> way<00:03:18.010> where<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.520> get<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> deck

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
in a 71 this way where you get a deck

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.540 
in a 71 this way where you get a deck
you<00:03:19.330> take<00:03:19.570> one<00:03:19.810> card<00:03:20.140> out<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.620> pass<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
you take one card out and pass it to the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.460 
you take one card out and pass it to the
other<00:03:21.700> players<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.360> then<00:03:22.480> same<00:03:22.960> again<00:03:23.290> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
other players and then same again and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.290 
other players and then same again and
again<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:24.010> create<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> deck<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.700> your<00:03:25.030> own

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
again and you create a deck of your own

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.540 
again and you create a deck of your own
specific<00:03:26.050> cards<00:03:26.410> but<00:03:27.130> apart<00:03:27.370> from<00:03:27.400> that

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
specific cards but apart from that

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.540 
specific cards but apart from that
that's<00:03:27.790> basically<00:03:28.180> where<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.390> expansion<00:03:28.690> is

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
that's basically where the expansion is

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.400 
that's basically where the expansion is
so<00:03:30.570> summing<00:03:31.570> up<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:32.080> king<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.440> Tokyo<00:03:32.680> power<00:03:33.340> up

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
so summing up for king of Tokyo power up

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.210 
so summing up for king of Tokyo power up
um<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.490> board<00:03:36.850> game<00:03:37.560> expansion<00:03:38.560> that

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
um it's a board game expansion that

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610 
um it's a board game expansion that
everybody<00:03:40.060> should<00:03:40.210> not<00:03:41.020> get<00:03:41.170> too<00:03:41.380> excited

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
everybody should not get too excited

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.780 
everybody should not get too excited
about<00:03:43.200> why<00:03:44.200> do<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.410> say<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.710> now<00:03:45.340> there's<00:03:45.550> two

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
about why do I say that now there's two

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.370 
about why do I say that now there's two
reasons<00:03:46.000> why<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.360> say<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.840> when<00:03:47.050> I<00:03:47.140> bought

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
reasons why I say that when I bought

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.140 
reasons why I say that when I bought
this<00:03:47.680> when<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.430> first<00:03:48.640> came<00:03:48.760> out<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:48.970> thought

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
this when it first came out I thought

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.500 
this when it first came out I thought
whoa<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.630> love<00:03:50.380> king<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.040> Tokyo<00:03:51.190> what<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.390> this

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
whoa I love king of Tokyo what can this

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.220 
whoa I love king of Tokyo what can this
ad<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.900> make<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.200> even<00:03:53.380> better<00:03:55.050> nothing<00:03:56.050> I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
ad to make it even better nothing I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.860 
ad to make it even better nothing I
found<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:57.040> didn't<00:03:57.820> add<00:03:57.970> anything<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.570> added

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
found it didn't add anything it added

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.420 
found it didn't add anything it added
more<00:03:59.050> randomness<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.800> top<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.100> randomness

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
more randomness on top of randomness

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.390 
more randomness on top of randomness
that<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.940> already<00:04:01.150> there<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:02.980> regards<00:04:03.220> to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
that was already there and in regards to

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.560 
that was already there and in regards to
that<00:04:03.460> randomness<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.420> was<00:04:04.930> disappointed<00:04:05.200> that

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
that randomness I was disappointed that

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.530 
that randomness I was disappointed that
whenever<00:04:07.570> someone<00:04:08.080> would<00:04:08.260> turn<00:04:08.650> over<00:04:09.010> a

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
whenever someone would turn over a

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.020 
whenever someone would turn over a
permanent<00:04:10.540> power<00:04:11.170> card<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:12.850> would

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
permanent power card they would

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.760 
permanent power card they would
practically<00:04:13.390> walk<00:04:13.630> away<00:04:13.810> with<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.020> game<00:04:14.640> and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
practically walk away with the game and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.590 
practically walk away with the game and
only<00:04:17.770> a<00:04:17.799> couple<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.100> chances<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.609> I've<00:04:18.820> roll

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
only a couple of chances that I've roll

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.920 
only a couple of chances that I've roll
those<00:04:19.810> dice<00:04:19.840> got<00:04:20.500> those<00:04:20.650> three<00:04:20.950> hearts<00:04:21.489> oh<00:04:21.930> yes

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
those dice got those three hearts oh yes

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.260 
those dice got those three hearts oh yes
I'm<00:04:23.200> pulling<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.890> card<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.790> pull<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.150> the

I'm pulling up a card and I pull up the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.380 
I'm pulling up a card and I pull up the
temporary<00:04:25.720> power<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:27.640> loot<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:30.390> feel

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
temporary power and I loot so I feel

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.060 
temporary power and I loot so I feel
that<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.290> randomness<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:33.180> these<00:04:34.180> cards<00:04:35.070> sours

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
that the randomness of these cards sours

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.030 
that the randomness of these cards sours
my<00:04:36.250> experience<00:04:37.200> tremendously<00:04:38.200> because<00:04:38.530> you

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
my experience tremendously because you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.310 
my experience tremendously because you
can't<00:04:39.340> seem<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.790> win<00:04:40.000> if<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.330> don't<00:04:40.840> get

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
can't seem to win if you don't get
