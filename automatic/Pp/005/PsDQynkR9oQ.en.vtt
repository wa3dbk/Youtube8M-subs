pro players would say 60 frames per

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.539 
pro players would say 60 frames per
second<00:01:12.869> isn't<00:01:12.990> even<00:01:13.260> enough<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> need<00:01:13.770> 120

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
second isn't even enough you need 120

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
second isn't even enough you need 120
frames<00:01:14.670> hundred<00:01:15.150> 40<00:01:15.450> frames<00:01:15.630> whatever<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
frames hundred 40 frames whatever and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
frames hundred 40 frames whatever and
that's<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.830> too<00:01:17.040> big<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.400> deal<00:01:17.549> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> game

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that's not too big of a deal with a game

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
that's not too big of a deal with a game
like<00:01:18.000> Counter<00:01:18.450> Strike<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.320> easy

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like Counter Strike because it's so easy

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
like Counter Strike because it's so easy
to<00:01:19.830> run<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.670> bare-bones<00:01:21.270> gaming

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to run if you have a bare-bones gaming

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
to run if you have a bare-bones gaming
PC<00:01:22.259> rig<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.920> probably<00:01:23.159> run<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:23.820> at

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
PC rig you can probably run that game at

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
PC rig you can probably run that game at
above<00:01:24.270> 100<00:01:24.659> frames<00:01:24.780> per<00:01:25.049> second<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
above 100 frames per second but the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
above 100 frames per second but the
thing<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:25.830> counter-strike<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
thing about counter-strike is then you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
thing about counter-strike is then you
have<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> invest<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.229> monitor<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:28.890> 120

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have to invest in a monitor that's 120

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
have to invest in a monitor that's 120
Hertz<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> majority<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Hertz because because the majority of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
Hertz because because the majority of
monitors<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:32.009> 60<00:01:32.460> Hertz<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.060> 144<00:01:33.750> Hertz
