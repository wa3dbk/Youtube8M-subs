00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.000
 Hello, I am a pillar of sewing and we are going to 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.450
 make the point bodoque especially 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.969
 indicated for baby clothing that consists 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.260
 of two completely different laps 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:22.210
 in the first we are going to make chains 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.869
 and then we start with three chains 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.400
 two 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.170
 and we skipped three base points and 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.649
 we make a low point 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.260
 three chain stitches under three chains 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.969
 point under this point has many 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.479
 variants depends on what you like with 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.940
 more steering wheel with less steering wheel and that 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.810
 depends on the first round the number 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.080
 of chains that hamas 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.620
 here we have thought about doing three and a 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.739
 point down 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 and now we are going to turn the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.410
 Water 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.550
 and let's do the steering wheel 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.180
 for this we start by making a point 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.010
 high and in the first hole we do 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.290
 three high points 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.830
 one 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.830
 two 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.360
 and three now is very important as 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.720
 go put the crochet 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.300
 pay attention that goes horizontally 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.000
 circling the low point of the turn 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.600
 previous we will not repeat 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.070
 and now and in that way 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.409
 you make three high points 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.350
 one 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.880
 we do the following always putting the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.360
 Crochet in the same way 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.360
 two 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.410
 3 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.990
 now my next hole we go back to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.270
 make the three points 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 I tell you the same thing as the first round 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.599
 see if you like it protrudes much 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.500
 bodoque and then you can put three 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.500
 high points 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.260
 three high points already you can 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:24.470
 put four points high the team 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 that depends on your taste we have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.849
 made three high points and three points 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.849
 tall surrounding the low 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.760
 the first round can be made from 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.490
 reverse and this one the right oil 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.130
 and so you do not have to cut the thread is 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.650
 very useful especially since you'll see it in the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.520
 hat that I have on the right a shot 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.690
 of xavi army takeoffs especially 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.690
 indicated in baby clothes 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.890
 and now I'm going to show you the result 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.890
 so you see a lot
