00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
hair so easily that you don't even know

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.070 
hair so easily that you don't even know
that<00:05:44.759> it's<00:05:45.060> there<00:05:45.150> until<00:05:45.449> you<00:05:45.599> put<00:05:45.779> your<00:05:45.900> hair

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
up and even then I can fit like half of

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.749 
up and even then I can fit like half of
it<00:05:48.330> into<00:05:48.509> my<00:05:48.659> ponytail<00:05:49.409> and<00:05:49.680> then<00:05:50.190> like<00:05:50.430> from

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
it into my ponytail and then like from

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.790 
it into my ponytail and then like from
here<00:05:50.940> down<00:05:51.210> it<00:05:51.539> doesn't<00:05:51.900> fit<00:05:52.259> in<00:05:52.379> and<00:05:52.529> I<00:05:52.589> just

here down it doesn't fit in and I just

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.860 
here down it doesn't fit in and I just
use<00:05:52.919> a<00:05:52.949> bobby<00:05:53.159> pin<00:05:53.339> belt<00:05:53.849> but<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.029> guess<00:05:54.300> that's

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870
