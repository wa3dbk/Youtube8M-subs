00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
going to use storyboard and no code at

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.859 
going to use storyboard and no code at
all<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> appeal<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
all so this is going to appeal to the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.350 
all so this is going to appeal to the
artists<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.560> there<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> we're<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
artists out there so we're going to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
artists out there so we're going to
start<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> master-detail<00:00:34.969> application

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
start with a master-detail application

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.080 
start with a master-detail application
and<00:00:36.290> then<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.980> create<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:40.340> right<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.730> open

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and then just create that right so open

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.279 
and then just create that right so open
up<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.270> storyboard<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.140> going

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
up your storyboard and then we're going

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.540 
up your storyboard and then we're going
to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.530> messing<00:00:46.860> around<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.410> now

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
to be messing around in that bit now

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
to be messing around in that bit now
this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> good<00:00:50.940> time<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.629> bring<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
this is a good time to bring in your

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hundred pixel PNG and I'll put it in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.599 
hundred pixel PNG and I'll put it in
supporting<00:00:59.850> files<00:01:00.620> now<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:01.829> careful<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
supporting files now be very careful you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.590 
supporting files now be very careful you
got<00:01:02.760> copy<00:01:03.090> checked<00:01:04.019> otherwise<00:01:05.150> Xcode<00:01:06.150> thinks

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
got copy checked otherwise Xcode thinks

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
got copy checked otherwise Xcode thinks
it's<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.020> desktop<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.799> wherever<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's on your desktop or wherever it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.929 
it's on your desktop or wherever it
isn't<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
isn't it the thing to do with this is to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.690 
isn't it the thing to do with this is to
find<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.360> plain<00:01:12.720> ordinary<00:01:13.140> view<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> view

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
find a plain ordinary view not a view

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
find a plain ordinary view not a view
controller<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.100> at

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
controller and that's the one right at

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.390 
controller and that's the one right at
the<00:01:17.610> bottom<00:01:18.030> view<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.080> plain<00:01:19.650> white<00:01:19.950> thing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the bottom view this plain white thing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
the bottom view this plain white thing
and<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.159> above<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
and put it just above to see that just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.880 
and put it just above to see that just
above<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> title<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> didn't<00:01:28.770> go

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
above the title there and it didn't go

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.929 
above the title there and it didn't go
in<00:01:29.270> try<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.509> put<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.829> above<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> title

white button you can pull it down

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.749 
white button you can pull it down
increase<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> size<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> there's<00:01:44.579> your

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
increase the size of it there's your

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
header have a look in this check yours

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.539 
header have a look in this check yours
is<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.640> mine<00:01:48.290> now<00:01:49.290> let's<00:01:49.590> first<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.159> put

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
is like mine now let's first of all put

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
is like mine now let's first of all put
an<00:01:50.909> image<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.229> we're<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.619> an

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
an image in so we're going to use an

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
an image in so we're going to use an
image<00:01:53.009> view<00:01:54.409> anyone<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:57.479> our<00:01:57.689> minds

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
image view anyone know it in our minds

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.840 
image view anyone know it in our minds
100<00:01:58.350> by<00:01:58.500> 100<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.140> play<00:02:01.590> around

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
100 by 100 so you can just play around

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.330 
100 by 100 so you can just play around
with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> positioning<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:04.189> right<00:02:05.189> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
with the positioning of that right so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.539 
with the positioning of that right so
once<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> got<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.880> image<00:02:06.119> view<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.140> view

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
once you got your image view on the view

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.089 
once you got your image view on the view
go<00:02:09.549> to<00:02:09.610> image<00:02:09.879> here<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.689> here<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.439> it<00:02:12.069> will

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
go to image here up here and it will

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.210 
go to image here up here and it will
find<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.670> there<00:02:13.329> it<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.739> now<00:02:14.739> let's<00:02:15.010> put<00:02:15.159> a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
find it there it is now let's put a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.000 
find it there it is now let's put a
couple<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.579> labels<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:17.409> let's<00:02:17.590> find<00:02:17.829> some

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
