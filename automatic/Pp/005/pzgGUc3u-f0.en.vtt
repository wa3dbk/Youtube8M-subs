00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
a very light handheld vacuum and it's

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.150 
a very light handheld vacuum and it's
actually<00:00:12.380> specifically<00:00:13.380> designed<00:00:13.889> for

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
actually specifically designed for

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.590 
actually specifically designed for
mattresses<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.240> suck<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.350> dust<00:00:16.770> mites<00:00:17.250> dust

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
mattresses to suck up dust mites dust

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.830 
mattresses to suck up dust mites dust
hair<00:00:18.830> dust<00:00:19.830> dust<00:00:20.699> mites<00:00:21.029> basically<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
hair dust dust mites basically what I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890 
hair dust dust mites basically what I
just<00:00:21.930> said<00:00:22.289> three<00:00:22.560> times<00:00:22.769> over<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.660> great

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
just said three times over so it's great

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
just said three times over so it's great
because<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> helps<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.800> suck<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.160> allergens<00:00:26.699> as

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
because it helps to suck up allergens as

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.990 
because it helps to suck up allergens as
well<00:00:27.170> obviously<00:00:28.170> dust<00:00:28.949> mites<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.460> dust<00:00:29.699> make

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
well obviously dust mites and dust make

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
well obviously dust mites and dust make
it<00:00:30.119> harder<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.660> difficult<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.109> breathe

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
it harder and more difficult to breathe

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.749 
it harder and more difficult to breathe
because<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:31.859> more<00:00:32.009> particles<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.640> your

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
because there's more particles in your

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
because there's more particles in your
nose<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.120> mouth<00:00:33.420> while<00:00:34.020> you're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
nose in your mouth while you're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.470 
nose in your mouth while you're
breathing<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.860> by<00:00:35.430> using<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> were

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
breathing so by using this you were

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.180 
breathing so by using this you were
basically<00:00:37.200> purifying<00:00:37.860> your<00:00:37.980> air<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
basically purifying your air and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
basically purifying your air and
removing<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> particles<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
removing the particles so you can

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
removing the particles so you can
breathe<00:00:40.140> easier<00:00:40.559> which<00:00:41.160> means<00:00:41.399> better<00:00:41.850> for

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
breathe easier which means better for

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
breathe easier which means better for
people<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.629> asthma<00:00:43.399> better<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> have

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
people with asthma better if you have

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.940 
people with asthma better if you have
like<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:46.079> people<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.530> skin<00:00:46.770> rashes

or skin irritations from the mattress

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.889 
or skin irritations from the mattress
that<00:00:48.750> could<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.820> dust<00:00:50.820> mites<00:00:51.059> v

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

and I figured there can't be really need

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.300 
disgusting so I'm glad I have this this
is<00:02:08.080> more<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.440> mattress<00:02:08.679> but<00:02:08.830> what<00:02:09.039> I<00:02:09.069> also

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
is more for the mattress but what I also

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.270 
is more for the mattress but what I also
do<00:02:09.670> is<00:02:10.509> actually<00:02:10.780> use<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.470> my<00:02:11.830> rug<00:02:12.069> right

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
here what I'm about to show you as well

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.920 
here what I'm about to show you as well
as<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.830> wood<00:02:15.010> floors<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.360> suck<00:02:16.780> up

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
as on the wood floors to just suck up

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.280 
as on the wood floors to just suck up
anything<00:02:17.349> from<00:02:18.099> our<00:02:18.849> two-year-old<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
anything from our two-year-old and to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.010 
anything from our two-year-old and to
clean<00:02:20.950> crumbs<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.790> dust<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.510> hair<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
clean crumbs and dust and hair and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.740 
clean crumbs and dust and hair and
whatever<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> floor<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:25.239> fairly

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
whatever is on the floor so it's fairly

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.690 
whatever is on the floor so it's fairly
simple<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.200> actually<00:02:26.590> rotates<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.160> well<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
simple this actually rotates as well so

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.100 
simple this actually rotates as well so
when<00:02:27.850> you're<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> floor<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:28.600> just<00:02:28.810> found

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
when you're on the floor I just found

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.750 
when you're on the floor I just found
this<00:02:29.230> out<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.440> other<00:02:29.500> day<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.980> you're<00:02:30.459> going

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
this out the other day if you're going

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.309 
this out the other day if you're going
along<00:02:30.910> surface<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.569> go<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.840> it'll

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
along surface and you go like this it'll

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.080 
along surface and you go like this it'll
actually<00:02:32.470> rotate<00:02:33.069> for<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.519> as<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.910> see

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
actually rotate for you as you can see

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.880 
actually rotate for you as you can see
so<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.480> swivel<00:02:34.959> which<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.290> really

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so it's not a swivel which is really

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.440 
so it's not a swivel which is really
nice<00:02:36.100> because<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.209> get<00:02:37.300> different

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
nice because you can get different

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.180 
nice because you can get different
angles<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.950> trigger

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
angles with that so this is a trigger

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.620 
angles with that so this is a trigger
here<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.730> just<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.000> gun<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.450> hold

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
here it's just like a gun I can hold

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.759 
here it's just like a gun I can hold
with<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:40.780> hand<00:02:40.900> ice<00:02:41.200> typically<00:02:41.500> hold<00:02:41.650> with

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
with one hand ice typically hold with

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.559 
with one hand ice typically hold with
one<00:02:41.950> or<00:02:42.069> two<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.670> then<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.330> here<00:02:43.540> you

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
one or two and then in the back here you

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.690 
one or two and then in the back here you
have<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.810> max<00:02:44.019> button<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.650> put<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.549> on

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
have the max button to put it on

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.360 
have the max button to put it on
overdrive<00:02:46.390> if<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.870> will<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.950> max<00:02:48.160> back

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
overdrive if you will the max back

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.370 
overdrive if you will the max back
button<00:02:48.819> that's<00:02:49.390> one<00:02:49.630> downside<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> wears

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
button that's one downside as it wears

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.500 
button that's one downside as it wears
on<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.590> battery<00:02:50.920> quite<00:02:51.160> quickly<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:52.030> really

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
on the battery quite quickly you really

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.210 
on the battery quite quickly you really
don't<00:02:52.810> need<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> use<00:02:53.260> max<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.769> unless<00:02:54.010> you're

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
don't need to use max so unless you're

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.000 
don't need to use max so unless you're
using<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.880> your<00:02:55.030> mattress<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.660> use<00:02:56.049> the

using it on your mattress I use the
regular<00:02:58.530> function<00:02:59.530> or<00:02:59.860> whatever<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.819> raw

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239

it's the mattress so I'm gonna show you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.640 
it's the mattress so I'm gonna show you
how<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.730> works<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.000> mattress<00:03:16.150> here<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
how it works in the mattress here and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.009 
how it works in the mattress here and
how<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.829> sounds<00:03:18.220> sounds<00:03:18.519> awesome<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.780> just

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
how it sounds sounds awesome so you just

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.260 
how it sounds sounds awesome so you just
go<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:20.410> this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.250 

and<00:03:26.270> I've<00:03:26.390> noticed<00:03:26.570> one<00:03:26.810> thing<00:03:26.840> -<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.170> actually

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
and I've noticed one thing - it actually

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.630 
and I've noticed one thing - it actually
works<00:03:27.590> better<00:03:27.740> if<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.010> go<00:03:28.160> forward<00:03:28.550> as

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
works better if you go forward as

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.210 
works better if you go forward as
opposed<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.000> backwards<00:03:29.060> when<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.540> come<00:03:29.720> back

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
opposed to backwards when I come back

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.980 
opposed to backwards when I come back

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
it's kind of like I don't know I think

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:52.570 
it's kind of like I don't know I think
it's<00:03:33.200> meant<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.380> go<00:03:33.500> forward<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.400> wood

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580

the<00:03:56.510> detachment<00:03:56.900> pieces<00:03:57.560> work<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.250> like

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
the detachment pieces work just like

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.540 
the detachment pieces work just like
this<00:03:58.640> this<00:03:58.910> one<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.270> four<00:03:59.540> different<00:03:59.720> corners

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
this this one is four different corners

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.220 
this this one is four different corners
and<00:04:01.550> then<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.850> has<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> little<00:04:02.570> brush<00:04:02.780> like<00:04:02.810> this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
and then it has a little brush like this

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.710 
and then it has a little brush like this
that<00:04:03.800> detectives<00:04:04.340> well<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:04.880> then<00:04:05.300> this<00:04:05.480> one

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
that detectives well and then this one

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.050 
that detectives well and then this one
is<00:04:06.200> also<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:07.370> know<00:04:07.400> for<00:04:07.730> kind<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:07.970> like

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
corners and things like that so you have

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.460 
corners and things like that so you have
the<00:04:10.280> different<00:04:10.670> uses<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.150> purposes<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:11.870> as

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.040 

well<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:16.039> get<00:05:16.159> dust<00:05:16.340> mites<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.750> is<00:05:17.900> all

well to get dust mites and this is all

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.540 
well to get dust mites and this is all
stuff<00:05:18.229> from<00:05:18.289> outside<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.710> did<00:05:18.919> this<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.430> other

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
stuff from outside I did this the other

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.119 
stuff from outside I did this the other
day<00:05:19.639> but<00:05:20.259> there's<00:05:21.259> probably<00:05:21.560> some<00:05:21.770> more<00:05:21.919> dust

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
day but there's probably some more dust

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.159 
day but there's probably some more dust
mites<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.490> there<00:05:22.669> but<00:05:22.879> I<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.840> know<00:05:23.870> it's

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
mites in there but I you know it's

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.350 
mites in there but I you know it's
incredible<00:05:24.319> how<00:05:24.800> well<00:05:25.159> it<00:05:25.280> works<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:26.150> only

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
incredible how well it works the only

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.939 
incredible how well it works the only
downside<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.020> would<00:05:27.229> say<00:05:27.379> if<00:05:27.440> this<00:05:27.680> whole<00:05:27.919> unit

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
downside I would say if this whole unit

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.999 
downside I would say if this whole unit
are<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:29.060> charging<00:05:29.990> cord<00:05:30.229> it<00:05:30.470> kind<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.800> falls

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
are the charging cord it kind of falls

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.710 
are the charging cord it kind of falls
out<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.370> wall<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:32.090> every<00:05:32.240> once<00:05:32.419> in<00:05:32.509> a<00:05:32.569> while

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
out of the wall so every once in a while

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.089 
out of the wall so every once in a while
it<00:05:32.900> just<00:05:33.139> seems<00:05:33.319> kind<00:05:33.500> of<00:05:33.590> loosely<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:34.009> a

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
it just seems kind of loosely it's a

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.129 
it just seems kind of loosely it's a
British<00:05:34.460> company<00:05:34.669> so<00:05:35.030> maybe<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.509> the

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
British company so maybe it's the

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.260 
British company so maybe it's the
outlets<00:05:36.470> are<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.650> little<00:05:36.800> bit<00:05:37.039> thinner<00:05:38.000> or

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
outlets are a little bit thinner or

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.399 
outlets are a little bit thinner or
something<00:05:38.569> over<00:05:38.720> there<00:05:38.810> I'm<00:05:38.930> not<00:05:39.020> really<00:05:39.139> sure

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
something over there I'm not really sure

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.649 
something over there I'm not really sure
but<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:40.340> then<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.580> max<00:05:40.819> does<00:05:41.210> wear<00:05:41.419> down<00:05:41.509> the

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
but and then the max does wear down the

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.390 
but and then the max does wear down the
very<00:05:41.870> very<00:05:42.229> quickly<00:05:42.500> but<00:05:42.770> like<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.039> said<00:05:43.099> you
