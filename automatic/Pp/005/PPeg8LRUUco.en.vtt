00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
not very much and that will do the job

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
not very much and that will do the job
now<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> can't<00:00:53.129> eat<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.120> fresh<00:00:54.629> as

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
they are but they do have some of that
raw<00:00:59.370> pea<00:00:59.789> flavor<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.960> an<00:01:01.140> English<00:01:01.530> pea<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
raw pea flavor like an English pea not a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.840

so that if you don't like that flavor

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.240 
so that if you don't like that flavor
