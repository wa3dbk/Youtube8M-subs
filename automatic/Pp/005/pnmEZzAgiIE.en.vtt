a lot of controversy and debate about

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.150 
a lot of controversy and debate about

I've<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.460> pretty<00:00:56.670> definite<00:00:57.449> proof<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
I've some pretty definite proof that it

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
I've some pretty definite proof that it
does<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:58.980> exist<00:00:59.609> like<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.260> exists
