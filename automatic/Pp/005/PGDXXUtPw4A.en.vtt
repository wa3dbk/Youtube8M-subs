welcome<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.500> tutorial<00:00:11.099> where<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.400> are

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
welcome to this tutorial where we are

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.970 
welcome to this tutorial where we are
going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.969> talk<00:00:12.240> about<00:00:12.269> muscle<00:00:13.139> actions<00:00:13.710> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
going to talk about muscle actions and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.430 
going to talk about muscle actions and
functional<00:00:14.820> groups<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.450> muscles<00:00:15.629> we've

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
functional groups of muscles we've

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.410 
functional groups of muscles we've
already<00:00:16.740> discussed<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.820> types<00:00:18.120> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
already discussed all the types of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.380 
already discussed all the types of
movements<00:00:19.050> allowed<00:00:19.530> by<00:00:19.800> our<00:00:20.040> joints<00:00:20.580> such<00:00:21.120> as

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
movements allowed by our joints such as

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.080 
movements allowed by our joints such as
our<00:00:21.570> extension<00:00:22.350> flexion<00:00:23.090> abduction

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
our extension flexion abduction

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.930 
our extension flexion abduction
adduction<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.200> all<00:00:25.440> the<00:00:25.710> rest<00:00:25.950> but<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.880> we

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
adduction and all the rest but now we

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.230 
adduction and all the rest but now we
need<00:00:27.270> to<00:00:27.480> focus<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.010> muscles<00:00:29.460> make

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
need to focus on how the muscles make

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.669 
need to focus on how the muscles make
these<00:00:30.480> actions<00:00:31.080> occur<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.230> I've<00:00:34.350> got<00:00:34.500> up

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:34.679 
these actions occur so what I've got up

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.279 
these actions occur so what I've got up
on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.829> screen<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.339> is<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> left<00:00:36.359> lateral

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
on the screen here is a left lateral

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.849 
on the screen here is a left lateral
view<00:00:37.589> of<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:38.100> person<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.929> shoulder<00:00:40.530> down

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
view of a person from the shoulder down

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.479 
view of a person from the shoulder down
are<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.429> focusing<00:00:41.999> on<00:00:42.210> their<00:00:42.480> left<00:00:43.079> arm<00:00:43.489> what

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
are just focusing on their left arm what

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
are just focusing on their left arm what
we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> look<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.749> few

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
we're going to look at now is a few

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.470 
we're going to look at now is a few
different<00:00:46.679> muscles<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> naming<00:00:48.329> our

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
different muscles and naming our

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.149 
different muscles and naming our
functional<00:00:49.320> groups<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.769> go<00:00:52.800> we've

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
functional groups so there we go we've

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.250 
functional groups so there we go we've
got<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.550> couple<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> muscles<00:00:54.600> highlighted

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
got a couple of the muscles highlighted

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.509 
got a couple of the muscles highlighted
and<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:56.699> left<00:00:56.999> lateral<00:00:57.239> view<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.249> can

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
and a left lateral view and now we can

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.219 
and a left lateral view and now we can
focus<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.179> what<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.629> functional<00:01:01.170> groups

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
focus on what these functional groups

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.100 
focus on what these functional groups
are<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.179> need<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.809> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
are the first thing we need to know is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
are the first thing we need to know is
that<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> four<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.640> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that there is four of them and this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.150 
that there is four of them and this
naming<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> functional<00:01:10.290> groups<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
naming of the functional groups is in

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.700 
naming of the functional groups is in
relation<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> type<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> movement<00:01:13.170> we're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
relation to the type of movement we're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
relation to the type of movement we're
trying<00:01:14.160> to<00:01:14.430> achieve

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
trying to achieve

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.440 
trying to achieve
the<00:01:16.110> first<00:01:16.560> type<00:01:16.950> being<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.000> prime<00:01:18.810> mover<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the first type being a prime mover and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
the first type being a prime mover and
for<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.660> tutorial<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.620> movement<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> are

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
for this tutorial the movement we are

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.200 
for this tutorial the movement we are
going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.910> talk<00:01:24.690> about<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.650> elbow

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
going to talk about will be elbow

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
going to talk about will be elbow
flexion<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> movement<00:01:28.740> you'd<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.980> doing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
flexion so the movement you'd be doing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.970 
flexion so the movement you'd be doing
if<00:01:29.370> you<00:01:29.460> were<00:01:29.580> doing<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.910> bicep<00:01:30.360> curl<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.980> prime

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
if you were doing a bicep curl a prime

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.800 
if you were doing a bicep curl a prime
movies<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.730> muscle<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> movement

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
movies are the muscle in the movement

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.320 
movies are the muscle in the movement
that<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.080> responsible<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.010> the<00:01:35.700> majority<00:01:36.300> of

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
that is responsible for the majority of

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.650 
that is responsible for the majority of
the<00:01:36.630> action<00:01:37.200> taking<00:01:37.740> place<00:01:38.480> therefore<00:01:39.480> it

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the action taking place therefore it

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.380 
the action taking place therefore it
will<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.230> highest<00:01:40.850> workload<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.090> all

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
will have the highest workload of all

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.140 
will have the highest workload of all
the<00:01:42.540> muscles<00:01:42.960> involved<00:01:43.440> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.830> action<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
the muscles involved in the action so

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.260 
the muscles involved in the action so
the<00:01:45.360> largest<00:01:45.920> workload<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> look

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the largest workload if we have a look

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
the largest workload if we have a look
at<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> muscles<00:01:48.780> I've<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.110> highlighted<00:01:49.710> here

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
at the muscles I've got highlighted here

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
at the muscles I've got highlighted here
which<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> be

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
which one do you think it's going to be

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
which one do you think it's going to be
there<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:54.210> bicep<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> tricep<00:01:55.650> or<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there be the bicep or the tricep or the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
there be the bicep or the tricep or the
brachioradialis<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.980> I've<00:01:59.100> got

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
brachioradialis that I've got

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.720 
brachioradialis that I've got
highlighted<00:01:59.850> down<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> bottom<00:02:01.340> no<00:02:02.340> it's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
highlighted down the bottom no it's

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.590 
highlighted down the bottom no it's
definitely<00:02:03.480> going<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:04.020> our<00:02:04.790> bicep<00:02:05.790> our

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
definitely going to be our bicep our

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540 
definitely going to be our bicep our
bicep<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.830> extending<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
bicep is going to be extending the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.029 
bicep is going to be extending the
length<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> humerus<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.439> inserting

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
length of the humerus and then inserting

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.640 
length of the humerus and then inserting
down<00:02:11.549> onto<00:02:12.030> our<00:02:12.060> radius<00:02:12.749> now<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.439> we're

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
down onto our radius now if we're

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.140 
down onto our radius now if we're
lifting<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.219> elbow

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
lifting the elbow

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.839 
lifting the elbow
upwards<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.019> decreasing<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> angle<00:02:17.489> which

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
upwards and decreasing that angle which

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.720 
upwards and decreasing that angle which
is<00:02:17.879> what<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.780> flexion<00:02:19.280> we're<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.549> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
is what we do in flexion we're going to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.759 
is what we do in flexion we're going to
need<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.180> insertion<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.200> radius<00:02:22.560> for

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
need that insertion on the radius for

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.970 
need that insertion on the radius for
the<00:02:22.860> bicep<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.489> pull<00:02:23.790> against<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.709> I'll<00:02:25.709> just

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the bicep to pull against and I'll just

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.009 
the bicep to pull against and I'll just
point<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:26.879> your<00:02:27.180> prime<00:02:27.569> movies

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
point out as well that your prime movies

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.520 
point out as well that your prime movies
will<00:02:28.319> often<00:02:28.920> be<00:02:29.069> called<00:02:29.340> agonists<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.290> that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
will often be called agonists so that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.380 
will often be called agonists so that
the<00:02:31.620> muscle<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.010> has<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.459> largest<00:02:32.760> workload

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the muscle that has the largest workload

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.940 
the muscle that has the largest workload
so<00:02:33.599> they're<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> muscle<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:34.409> going<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.799> be

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
so they're the muscle that's going to be

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.050 
so they're the muscle that's going to be
in<00:02:35.209> agony<00:02:36.209> when<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:36.840> work<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.579> second

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
in agony when you work it and the second

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.289 
in agony when you work it and the second
type<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:40.340> functional<00:02:41.340> group<00:02:41.579> we<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:42.060> is

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
type of functional group we have is

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.979 
type of functional group we have is
called<00:02:42.569> an<00:02:42.780> antagonist<00:02:43.879> the<00:02:44.879> antagonist<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
called an antagonist the antagonist is

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.589 
called an antagonist the antagonist is
going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> creating<00:02:47.099> resistance<00:02:47.599> against

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
going to be creating resistance against

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.630 
going to be creating resistance against
that<00:02:48.900> prime<00:02:49.290> mover<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.950> preventing

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
that prime mover and preventing

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.750 
that prime mover and preventing
overshoot<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.410> opposes<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.370> desired

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
overshoot so it opposes the desired

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.089 
overshoot so it opposes the desired
movement<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.359> often<00:02:54.810> becomes<00:02:55.170> stretched<00:02:55.859> out

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
movement and often becomes stretched out

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.039 
movement and often becomes stretched out
which<00:02:56.549> will<00:02:56.760> help<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.120> muscles<00:02:57.510> are<00:02:57.690> spring

back to their resting position after
that<00:03:00.930> contraction<00:03:01.709> now<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.879> were

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that contraction now if we were

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.420 
that contraction now if we were
contracting<00:03:03.780> our<00:03:03.900> bicep<00:03:04.440> do<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.250> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
contracting our bicep do you think that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.369 
contracting our bicep do you think that
our<00:03:05.609> brachioradialis<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.840> going<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.260> be

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
our brachioradialis is going to be

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.360 
our brachioradialis is going to be
stretched<00:03:07.829> out<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> provide<00:03:08.579> resistance<00:03:10.370> no

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
stretched out and provide resistance no

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.270 
stretched out and provide resistance no
it's<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.390> our<00:03:12.599> triceps<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.620> with

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
it's going to be our triceps and with

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.399 
it's going to be our triceps and with
that<00:03:14.549> point<00:03:14.879> an<00:03:15.120> antagonist<00:03:15.930> will<00:03:16.140> almost

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
that point an antagonist will almost

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.789 
that point an antagonist will almost
always<00:03:16.859> be<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.329> opposite<00:03:18.959> side<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
joint of the prime mover so I've just

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.710 
joint of the prime mover so I've just
outlined<00:03:23.459> our<00:03:24.030> triceps<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.930> blue<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.530> it's

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
outlined our triceps in blue and it's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.069 
outlined our triceps in blue and it's
antagonizing<00:03:27.720> our<00:03:27.989> elbow<00:03:28.590> flexion<00:03:29.280> so

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
antagonizing our elbow flexion so

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.089 
antagonizing our elbow flexion so
antagonizing<00:03:31.079> our<00:03:31.260> biceps<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.180> opposes

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
antagonizing our biceps so it opposes

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.159 
antagonizing our biceps so it opposes
the<00:03:35.099> bicep<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.879> will<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.569> opposite

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
the bicep and will be on the opposite

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.470 
the bicep and will be on the opposite
side<00:03:37.859> now<00:03:38.629> we<00:03:39.629> have<00:03:39.959> our<00:03:40.109> prime<00:03:40.500> movers<00:03:41.040> and

side now we have our prime movers and

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.360 
side now we have our prime movers and
antagonists<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:43.319> third<00:03:43.680> functional

group we have is called a synergist a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.210 
group we have is called a synergist a
synergist<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> muscle<00:03:49.379> that's<00:03:49.530> going<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.069> be

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
synergist is a muscle that's going to be

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.300 
synergist is a muscle that's going to be
helping<00:03:50.819> our<00:03:51.060> prime<00:03:51.419> mover<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.739> we<00:03:52.919> don't<00:03:53.129> want

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
helping our prime mover so we don't want

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.400 
helping our prime mover so we don't want
to<00:03:53.340> put<00:03:53.549> all<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.299> load<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.810> specific

to put all of the load of a specific
movement<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.949> the<00:03:56.160> one<00:03:56.340> muscle<00:03:56.819> that's<00:03:57.780> why<00:03:58.079> we

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
movement on the one muscle that's why we

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.900 
movement on the one muscle that's why we
have<00:03:58.440> these<00:03:58.620> synergies<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.489> I'm<00:03:59.639> just

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
have these synergies and I'm just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.199 
have these synergies and I'm just
outlining<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:01.349> brachioradialis<00:04:01.970> here<00:04:02.970> which

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
outlining the brachioradialis here which

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.939 
outlining the brachioradialis here which
is<00:04:03.389> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.959> our<00:04:04.169> synergist

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
is going to be our synergist

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:10.670 
is going to be our synergist
for<00:04:05.489> our<00:04:05.730> bicep<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.540> elbow<00:04:07.019> flexion<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:10.440> if

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
for our bicep and elbow flexion so if

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.759 
for our bicep and elbow flexion so if
something<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.340> creating<00:04:12.060> synergy<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.440> means

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
something is creating synergy it means

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.909 
something is creating synergy it means
it's<00:04:14.069> are<00:04:14.250> working<00:04:14.910> in<00:04:15.209> harmony<00:04:16.199> with<00:04:16.680> each

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
it's are working in harmony with each

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.039 
it's are working in harmony with each
other<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.519> they're<00:04:18.299> helping<00:04:18.690> each<00:04:18.810> other

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
other and they're helping each other

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.319 
other and they're helping each other
achieve<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.769> same<00:04:20.099> job<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:21.000> going<00:04:21.209> to

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
achieve the same job so it's going to

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.290 
achieve the same job so it's going to
add<00:04:21.630> force<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.770> movement<00:04:23.159> and<00:04:23.849> it's<00:04:24.000> also

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
add force to that movement and it's also

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.830 
add force to that movement and it's also
going<00:04:24.719> to<00:04:24.810> help<00:04:25.140> stabilize<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:27.030> bone<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.659> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
going to help stabilize the bone and the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.879 
going to help stabilize the bone and the
joint

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
joint

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.719 
joint
that<00:04:29.039> that<00:04:29.189> prime<00:04:29.520> mover<00:04:29.879> is<00:04:30.030> working<00:04:30.599> against

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
that that prime mover is working against

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.029 
that that prime mover is working against
now<00:04:32.729> using<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.479> brachioradialis<00:04:34.110> as<00:04:34.889> an

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
now using this brachioradialis as an

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.670 
now using this brachioradialis as an
example<00:04:35.729> it's<00:04:36.360> going<00:04:36.569> to<00:04:36.749> be<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> synergist<00:04:37.499> in

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
example it's going to be a synergist in

trying to achieve which is elbow flexion
they<00:05:00.240> can<00:05:00.449> help<00:05:00.749> each<00:05:00.930> other<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.379> they<00:05:01.469> can

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 
they can help each other and they can

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.749 
they can help each other and they can
move<00:05:02.219> together<00:05:03.139> but<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.379> brachioradialis<00:05:04.979> is

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
move together but the brachioradialis is

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.990 
move together but the brachioradialis is
also<00:05:06.300> going<00:05:06.509> to<00:05:06.629> overlap<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.860> bicep<00:05:08.340> once<00:05:08.789> it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
also going to overlap the bicep once it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.860 
also going to overlap the bicep once it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
passes on to the radius meaning that it

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.670 
passes on to the radius meaning that it
can<00:05:13.139> stabilize<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:14.250> prevent<00:05:14.729> the<00:05:14.909> bicep

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
can stabilize and prevent the bicep

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.980 
can stabilize and prevent the bicep
rotating<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.860> radius<00:05:17.279> accidentally<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:18.629> it's

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
rotating the radius accidentally so it's

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.409 
rotating the radius accidentally so it's
a<00:05:19.319> synergist<00:05:20.159> in<00:05:20.339> the<00:05:20.460> fact<00:05:20.699> that<00:05:20.759> it's<00:05:20.969> adding

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
a synergist in the fact that it's adding

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.079 
a synergist in the fact that it's adding
force<00:05:21.689> and<00:05:22.039> stabilizing<00:05:23.039> at<00:05:23.219> the<00:05:23.400> same<00:05:23.699> time

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:24.089 
force and stabilizing at the same time

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:27.800 
force and stabilizing at the same time
and<00:05:24.419> that<00:05:24.919> leads<00:05:25.919> us<00:05:26.189> to<00:05:26.490> our<00:05:26.520> fourth<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.479> last

and that leads us to our fourth and last

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.760 
and that leads us to our fourth and last
functional<00:05:28.499> group<00:05:28.770> which<00:05:29.159> are<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.610> fixators

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
functional group which are the fixators

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.350 
functional group which are the fixators
fixators<00:05:31.770> are<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:31.949> more<00:05:32.279> specific<00:05:32.639> type<00:05:33.330> of

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
fixators are a more specific type of

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.570 
fixators are a more specific type of
stabilizer<00:05:34.110> muscle<00:05:34.620> that's<00:05:34.830> going<00:05:35.129> to<00:05:35.279> give

the prime mover an immobilized bone to

the prime mover an immobilized bone to
act<00:05:39.029> upon<00:05:39.539> now<00:05:40.289> if<00:05:40.439> we<00:05:40.589> didn't<00:05:40.949> have<00:05:41.129> our

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
brachioradialis muscle on our arm elbow

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.480 
brachioradialis muscle on our arm elbow
flexion<00:05:45.089> would<00:05:45.419> lead<00:05:45.689> to<00:05:45.719> the<00:05:46.110> bicep<00:05:46.589> rotating

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
flexion would lead to the bicep rotating

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.240 
flexion would lead to the bicep rotating
our<00:05:47.729> radius<00:05:48.300> as<00:05:48.569> it<00:05:48.719> lifted<00:05:49.080> upward<00:05:49.529> meaning

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
our radius as it lifted upward meaning

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.990 
our radius as it lifted upward meaning
we<00:05:50.550> would<00:05:50.849> have<00:05:51.089> a<00:05:51.270> mobile<00:05:51.779> bone<00:05:52.469> but<00:05:53.460> because

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
we would have a mobile bone but because

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.600 
we would have a mobile bone but because
of<00:05:54.029> the<00:05:54.389> brachioradialis<00:05:55.039> we<00:05:56.039> can<00:05:56.219> prevent

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
of the brachioradialis we can prevent

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.879 
of the brachioradialis we can prevent
this<00:05:56.819> rotation<00:05:57.479> happening<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.139> immobilize

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
this rotation happening and immobilize

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.459 
this rotation happening and immobilize
the<00:05:59.159> radius<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.120> the<00:06:00.240> bicep<00:06:00.629> to<00:06:00.779> pull<00:06:01.020> against

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
the radius but the bicep to pull against

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.820 
the radius but the bicep to pull against
and<00:06:01.649> we<00:06:02.129> can<00:06:02.279> refer<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.969> this<00:06:03.149> as<00:06:03.419> a<00:06:03.750> fixator<00:06:04.529> as

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
and we can refer to this as a fixator as

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.559 
and we can refer to this as a fixator as
well<00:06:05.430> as<00:06:05.729> a<00:06:05.759> synergist

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
well as a synergist

well as a synergist
in<00:06:06.629> this<00:06:06.899> case<00:06:07.729> so<00:06:08.729> we've<00:06:08.969> covered<00:06:09.270> our<00:06:09.599> four

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.189 
in this case so we've covered our four

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.860 
in this case so we've covered our four
individual<00:06:11.189> functional<00:06:11.879> groups<00:06:12.210> now<00:06:12.449> and<00:06:12.750> the

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
individual functional groups now and the

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.110 
individual functional groups now and the
movements<00:06:13.439> that<00:06:13.830> they<00:06:14.069> allow<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.849> we<00:06:14.939> can

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
movements that they allow and we can

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.100 
movements that they allow and we can
apply<00:06:15.569> these<00:06:16.409> functional<00:06:17.219> groups<00:06:17.490> to<00:06:17.789> any

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
apply these functional groups to any

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.540 
apply these functional groups to any
movement<00:06:19.110> that<00:06:19.259> we<00:06:19.409> have<00:06:19.649> in<00:06:19.800> our<00:06:19.919> body<00:06:20.159> if<00:06:20.370> we

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
movement that we have in our body if we

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.969 
movement that we have in our body if we
think<00:06:20.789> of<00:06:21.000> a<00:06:21.680> flexion<00:06:22.680> of<00:06:22.740> our<00:06:23.159> leg<00:06:24.379> so<00:06:25.379> flexion

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
think of a flexion of our leg so flexion

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.139 
think of a flexion of our leg so flexion
of<00:06:26.129> our<00:06:26.430> knee<00:06:26.699> joint

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:27.149 
of our knee joint

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:29.899 
of our knee joint
what<00:06:27.569> would<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.870> prime<00:06:28.199> mover<00:06:28.710> be<00:06:28.949> well<00:06:29.759> the

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
what would the prime mover be well the

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.790 
what would the prime mover be well the
prime<00:06:30.149> mover<00:06:30.389> would<00:06:30.689> be<00:06:30.839> our<00:06:31.080> hamstrings

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
prime mover would be our hamstrings

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.429 
prime mover would be our hamstrings
wouldn't<00:06:32.399> it<00:06:32.599> because<00:06:33.599> our<00:06:33.750> hamstrings<00:06:34.259> are

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:34.439 
wouldn't it because our hamstrings are

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.439 
wouldn't it because our hamstrings are
going<00:06:34.589> to<00:06:34.680> be<00:06:34.800> responsible<00:06:35.339> for<00:06:35.460> closing<00:06:36.029> that

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
going to be responsible for closing that

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.259 
going to be responsible for closing that
angle<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.139> creating<00:06:37.649> flexion<00:06:38.190> which<00:06:39.000> would

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:39.269 
angle and creating flexion which would

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.719 
angle and creating flexion which would
mean<00:06:39.509> our<00:06:39.830> antagonist<00:06:40.830> would<00:06:41.099> be<00:06:41.339> our

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
mean our antagonist would be our

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:42.800 
mean our antagonist would be our
quadricep<00:06:42.479> muscle

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
quadricep muscle

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.320 
quadricep muscle
so<00:06:43.710> if<00:06:43.889> you<00:06:44.010> have<00:06:44.160> a<00:06:44.190> think<00:06:44.490> about<00:06:44.580> any<00:06:44.940> part<00:06:45.270> of

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
so if you have a think about any part of

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.970
