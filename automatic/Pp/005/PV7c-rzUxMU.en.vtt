so<00:02:36.889> that's<00:02:37.069> pebble<00:02:37.430> we<00:02:38.389> finished<00:02:38.719> the<00:02:38.840> design

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
so that's pebble we finished the design

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.990 
so that's pebble we finished the design
and<00:02:39.379> reduced<00:02:40.219> about<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.549> start<00:02:40.730> production

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and reduced about to start production

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.809 
and reduced about to start production
but<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.079> need<00:02:42.230> help<00:02:42.439> to<00:02:42.739> get<00:02:42.859> pebble<00:02:43.220> onto<00:02:43.639> your

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
but we need help to get pebble onto your

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.639 
but we need help to get pebble onto your
wrist<00:02:44.109> we<00:02:45.109> hope<00:02:45.260> you'll<00:02:45.409> join<00:02:45.439> us<00:02:45.739> thanks
