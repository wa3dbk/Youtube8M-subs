00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.280
 Going to Wimbledon is my dream 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840
 I like Wimbledon and think about playing there. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.600
 Wimbledon is the most important tennis tournament 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.240
 All legends are produced there 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 I have been involved in HSBC’s “Road to Wimbledon” since 2002. 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.560
 The event was mainly held in the UK 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.280
 But we feel that we can take this opportunity 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.680
 Promote the spirit of Wimbledon to the world 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.920
 I have been playing tennis for six years. 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.360
 I like the physical exercise of tennis. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.920
 And can promote health 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.560
 I want to be a professional player. 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.160
 I have a lot of sports in my school when I was a child. 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 Since then, I like tennis most. 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.080
 I started playing tennis from the age of five and now practice four hours a day. 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.160
 I played very well when I was very young. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.840
 If I can go to Wimbledon 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 I will be very excited to be a player representing India. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.480
 This morning, the children came here. 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.400
 Just because of this event 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200
 And can see Henman 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.000
 And Wimbledon head coach Braulson is excited 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.760
 This is a rare experience for them. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.600
 Murray's grip is here. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.680
 And Del Potro’s swing is very large. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.720
 But they are all equally bent on hitting the ball. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.720
 I am very happy with the children. 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840
 Because they are full of energy and enthusiasm and very eager to learn 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520
 He is a good coach 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.160
 I understand that the most important thing about playing tennis is that you have good physical fitness. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.000
 I learned a lot and waited for me to go back to the tennis school. 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.320
 I will improve my swing skills and play better. 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.040
 I will do what they teach. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 They will use what they have learned today to improve their skills. 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.920
 They really like to play tennis 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 I hope this event 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.120
 Can really help the long-term development of Indian tennis
