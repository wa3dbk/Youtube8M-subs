so<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.720> few<00:01:15.050> days<00:01:15.110> ago<00:01:15.290> people<00:01:16.160> actually<00:01:16.520> went

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
so a few days ago people actually went

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.670 
so a few days ago people actually went
into<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.420> source<00:01:17.780> code<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.290> GTA<00:01:18.860> 5<00:01:19.160> on<00:01:19.460> ps3<00:01:20.120> and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
into the source code of GTA 5 on ps3 and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.310 
into the source code of GTA 5 on ps3 and
xbox360<00:01:21.680> since<00:01:22.490> hackers<00:01:23.120> cannot<00:01:23.540> get<00:01:23.960> on<00:01:24.140> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
xbox360 since hackers cannot get on to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.570 
xbox360 since hackers cannot get on to
the<00:01:24.350> source<00:01:24.680> code<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.130> next-generation

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
the source code of the next-generation

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.250 
the source code of the next-generation
consoles<00:01:26.330> because<00:01:26.900> they<00:01:27.020> are<00:01:27.229> not

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
consoles because they are not

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.930 
consoles because they are not
jailbreakable<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.640> little<00:01:28.850> bit

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
jailbreakable and it's a little bit

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.460 
jailbreakable and it's a little bit
harder<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.300> get<00:01:29.540> into<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.900> source<00:01:30.200> code<00:01:30.440> there

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
harder to get into the source code there

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.859 
harder to get into the source code there
so<00:01:31.400> they<00:01:31.520> went<00:01:31.700> into<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.000> current-gen

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
so they went into the current-gen

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.550 
so they went into the current-gen
consoles<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.680> GTA<00:01:34.460> 5<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:34.910> ps3<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.540> xbox<00:01:36.020> 360

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
consoles of GTA 5 on ps3 and xbox 360

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.469 
consoles of GTA 5 on ps3 and xbox 360
and<00:01:36.680> they<00:01:37.040> went<00:01:37.280> through<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.550> game<00:01:37.790> code<00:01:38.030> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
and they went through the game code that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.080 
and they went through the game code that
was<00:01:38.630> added<00:01:39.080> through<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.380> patch<00:01:39.610> 1.8<00:01:40.610> een<00:01:40.910> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
was added through the patch 1.8 een and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.460 
was added through the patch 1.8 een and
a<00:01:41.390> lot<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.540> people<00:01:41.840> said<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.320> was

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
a lot of people said that there was

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.590 
a lot of people said that there was
nothing<00:01:42.740> cuz<00:01:43.400> there<00:01:43.580> actually<00:01:44.000> was<00:01:44.240> because

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
nothing cuz there actually was because

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.570 
nothing cuz there actually was because
there<00:01:44.720> was<00:01:44.810> no<00:01:45.020> actual<00:01:45.290> new<00:01:45.770> playable<00:01:46.220> content

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
there was no actual new playable content

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.050 
there was no actual new playable content
from<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.750> update<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:48.770> secretly<00:01:49.490> rockstar

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
from that update but secretly rockstar

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.550 
from that update but secretly rockstar
added<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.660> snow<00:01:51.470> code<00:01:52.160> for<00:01:52.940> December<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.259> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
added a snow code for December so it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.460 
added a snow code for December so it
actually<00:01:54.950> turns<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.330> few<00:01:56.990> weeks<00:01:57.020> after

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
actually turns on a few weeks after

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.889 
actually turns on a few weeks after
December<00:01:58.100> starts<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:59.119> lasts<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.630> few<00:01:59.840> days

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
December starts and it lasts a few days

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.430 
December starts and it lasts a few days
so<00:02:00.710> people<00:02:00.979> can<00:02:01.490> get<00:02:01.729> snow<00:02:02.179> now<00:02:02.840> comparing<00:02:03.350> it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
so people can get snow now comparing it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.109 
so people can get snow now comparing it
to<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.590> snow<00:02:03.920> code<00:02:04.160> that<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.429> have<00:02:04.640> last<00:02:04.910> year

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
to the snow code that we have last year

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.150 
to the snow code that we have last year
is<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.570> same<00:02:05.780> exact<00:02:06.110> snow<00:02:06.380> nothing<00:02:06.920> different

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
is the same exact snow nothing different

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.940 
is the same exact snow nothing different
um<00:02:07.580> last<00:02:08.569> year<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.869> actually<00:02:09.140> did<00:02:09.470> not<00:02:09.619> like<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
um last year I actually did not like the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.220 
um last year I actually did not like the
snow<00:02:10.130> because<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.520> made<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.789> hard<00:02:11.120> for<00:02:11.330> races

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
snow because it made it hard for races

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.170 
snow because it made it hard for races
and<00:02:12.410> stuff<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.890> actually<00:02:13.880> when<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and stuff like that actually when the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.090 
and stuff like that actually when the
snow<00:02:14.360> started<00:02:14.690> DNS<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.350> around<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> lot<00:02:16.069> of

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
snow started DNS was around so a lot of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.340 
snow started DNS was around so a lot of
people<00:02:16.190> were<00:02:16.430> doing<00:02:16.610> races<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.240> circles<00:02:17.690> just

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
people were doing races in circles just

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.900 
people were doing races in circles just
to<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> money<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.430> was<00:02:19.520> really<00:02:19.640> hard

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
to get the money and it was really hard

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.130 
to get the money and it was really hard
to<00:02:19.970> make<00:02:20.060> turns<00:02:20.450> there<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.900> was<00:02:20.930> really

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
to make turns there so I was really

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.930 
to make turns there so I was really
getting<00:02:21.319> pissed<00:02:21.470> off<00:02:21.830> with<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.130> snow<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.880> I

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
getting pissed off with the snow so I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.730 
getting pissed off with the snow so I
actually<00:02:23.150> ate<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> DNS<00:02:23.930> without<00:02:24.260> snow<00:02:24.530> because

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
actually ate a DNS without snow because

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.590 
actually ate a DNS without snow because
it<00:02:24.830> was<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.160> really<00:02:25.610> making<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.150> mad<00:02:26.300> so

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
it was just really making me mad so

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
it was just really making me mad so
hopefully<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.200> year<00:02:27.470> they<00:02:27.830> make<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.130> option

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
hopefully this year they make an option

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.960 
hopefully this year they make an option
that<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.960> either<00:02:30.140> turn<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:30.740> or<00:02:31.130> off<00:02:31.550> snow

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that you can either turn on or off snow

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.610 
that you can either turn on or off snow
so<00:02:32.480> they'll<00:02:32.630> be<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> little<00:02:32.930> bit<00:02:33.080> easier<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so they'll be a little bit easier so you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.710 
so they'll be a little bit easier so you
can<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:33.920> into<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.340> lobby<00:02:34.580> with<00:02:34.850> snow<00:02:35.090> or<00:02:35.360> lobby

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
can go into a lobby with snow or lobby

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.750 
can go into a lobby with snow or lobby
without<00:02:35.959> snow<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.100> they'll<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.640> bit

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
without snow so they'll be a little bit

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.730 
without snow so they'll be a little bit
easier<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.300> people<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.600> play<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.410> guys

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
easier for people to play so you guys

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.800 
easier for people to play so you guys

online experience now in terms of
next-generation<00:02:47.150> consoles<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.930> am<00:02:48.170> pretty

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
next-generation consoles I am pretty

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.830 
next-generation consoles I am pretty
sure<00:02:48.530> there's<00:02:48.890> going<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.250> be<00:02:49.280> snow<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.150> i'm

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
sure there's going to be snow and i'm

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.760 
sure there's going to be snow and i'm
pretty<00:02:51.050> sure<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.319> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.470> look<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.650> same

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
pretty sure it's going to look the same

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.770 
pretty sure it's going to look the same
it<00:02:52.130> might<00:02:52.370> look<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.760> little<00:02:53.209> bit<00:02:53.420> different

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
it might look a little bit different

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.420 
it might look a little bit different
because<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.260> next<00:02:54.680> generation<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.340> it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
because it is next generation and it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.970 
because it is next generation and it
might<00:02:55.610> look<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.880> little<00:02:56.000> bit<00:02:56.150> more<00:02:56.300> HD<00:02:56.810> ish<00:02:56.980> but

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
might look a little bit more HD ish but

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.250 
might look a little bit more HD ish but
other<00:02:58.160> than<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.300> savings<00:02:59.720> ex<00:02:59.870> no<00:03:00.080> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
other than that it is a savings ex no it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.619 
other than that it is a savings ex no it
should<00:03:00.530> feel<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.920> same<00:03:01.159> and<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.879> will<00:03:02.120> last<00:03:02.390> a

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
should feel the same and it will last a

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.110 
should feel the same and it will last a
few<00:03:02.959> days<00:03:03.019> hopefully<00:03:03.650> now<00:03:04.250> Rockstar<00:03:04.790> always

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
time at the discretion from either a few

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.229 
time at the discretion from either a few
days<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.620> few<00:03:09.650> weeks<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.370> whole<00:03:10.610> month<00:03:10.910> if<00:03:11.090> they

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
days a few weeks a whole month if they

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.690 
days a few weeks a whole month if they
want<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:11.959> my<00:03:12.200> guests<00:03:12.530> as<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.069> was<00:03:13.250> last<00:03:13.520> year

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
want but my guests as it was last year

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.610 
want but my guests as it was last year
it<00:03:13.940> was<00:03:13.970> only<00:03:14.270> for<00:03:14.569> one<00:03:14.599> day<00:03:14.870> or<00:03:15.200> two<00:03:15.319> days

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
it was only for one day or two days

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.550 
it was only for one day or two days
after<00:03:16.099> that<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.239> snow<00:03:17.540> was<00:03:17.780> actually<00:03:18.140> DNS

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
after that all the snow was actually DNS

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.320 
after that all the snow was actually DNS
so<00:03:18.770> wasn't<00:03:19.190> legitimate<00:03:19.640> snow<00:03:19.849> rockstar

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
so wasn't legitimate snow rockstar

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.270 
so wasn't legitimate snow rockstar
didn't<00:03:20.630> mean<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
didn't mean it to be like that so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.160 
didn't mean it to be like that so
hopefully<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.880> year<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.330> actually<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> few

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
hopefully this year it's actually a few

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.260 
hopefully this year it's actually a few
days<00:03:24.350> legitimately<00:03:25.069> without<00:03:25.700> people<00:03:26.030> hacking

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
days legitimately without people hacking

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.720 
days legitimately without people hacking
it<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.690> cuz<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.380> was<00:03:27.590> pretty<00:03:27.860> fun<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.340> look<00:03:28.489> at

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
it in cuz it was pretty fun to look at

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.550 
it in cuz it was pretty fun to look at
and<00:03:28.940> definitely<00:03:29.209> i<00:03:29.480> actually<00:03:29.989> did<00:03:30.140> not<00:03:30.170> record

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
and definitely i actually did not record

and definitely i actually did not record
any<00:03:30.800> snow<00:03:31.100> footage<00:03:31.400> last<00:03:31.640> year<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.780> i<00:03:32.810> did

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
any snow footage last year because i did

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.440 
any snow footage last year because i did
not<00:03:33.080> have<00:03:33.410> my<00:03:33.650> Elgato<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:35.000> definitely<00:03:35.209> this

year<00:03:35.750> i'm<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.170> hoping<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:37.010> record<00:03:37.340> some

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459

actually<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.590> some<00:03:39.769> role<00:03:39.980> playing

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
actually for some role playing

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.880 
actually for some role playing
especially<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.090> there<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.170> new<00:03:42.440> glitch<00:03:42.680> to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
especially if there is a new glitch to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.070 
especially if there is a new glitch to
get<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.160> north<00:03:43.340> yankton<00:03:43.730> maybe<00:03:44.450> you<00:03:44.630> can<00:03:44.750> fly

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
get to north yankton maybe you can fly

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.390 
get to north yankton maybe you can fly
through<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.560> snow<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:45.890> north<00:03:46.250> yankton

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
through the snow to north yankton

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.580 
through the snow to north yankton
that'll<00:03:46.880> look<00:03:47.000> really<00:03:47.060> cool<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.989> definitely

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590
