it seems like something oh I'd never use

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.220 
it seems like something oh I'd never use
this<00:00:33.550> why<00:00:33.850> don't<00:00:34.060> I<00:00:34.120> just<00:00:34.150> use<00:00:34.480> splines<00:00:34.960> and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
this why don't I just use splines and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.750 
this why don't I just use splines and
I'd<00:00:35.680> like<00:00:35.770> to<00:00:35.890> put<00:00:36.010> it<00:00:36.070> back<00:00:36.190> on<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.370> table<00:00:36.520> is

a very useful tool and i want to show

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.400 
a very useful tool and i want to show
you<00:00:38.470> why<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.270> set<00:00:40.480> up<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.630> simple<00:00:40.780> scene<00:00:41.140> here

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
you why so set up a simple scene here

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.380 
you why so set up a simple scene here
it's<00:00:41.560> just<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.310> know<00:00:42.370> chamfered<00:00:42.910> box<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.360> a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
it's just a you know chamfered box and a

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.720 
it's just a you know chamfered box and a
plane<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.930> few<00:00:44.710> cylinders<00:00:45.130> embedded<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
plane a few cylinders embedded in the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.730 
plane a few cylinders embedded in the
two<00:00:45.880> and<00:00:46.180> these<00:00:46.660> here<00:00:46.900> are<00:00:46.960> point<00:00:47.290> objects

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
two and these here are point objects

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.190 
two and these here are point objects
these<00:00:47.890> little<00:00:48.130> green<00:00:48.250> things<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.840> point

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
these little green things there point

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.480 
these little green things there point
objects<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:50.770> all<00:00:50.860> they<00:00:50.980> do<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.130> they<00:00:51.340> just

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.490 
objects and all they do is they just

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.540 
objects and all they do is they just
they<00:00:51.910> just<00:00:51.940> hold<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.750> position<00:00:53.710> in<00:00:54.070> space<00:00:54.220> and

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
they just hold a position in space and

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.520 
they just hold a position in space and
that's<00:00:54.670> why<00:00:54.820> I<00:00:54.850> have<00:00:55.000> them<00:00:55.180> here<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.540> prefer<00:00:56.350> to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
that's why I have them here I prefer to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.020 
that's why I have them here I prefer to
use<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.770> hose<00:00:56.920> with<00:00:57.100> point<00:00:57.370> objects<00:00:57.760> because

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
use the hose with point objects because

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
use the hose with point objects because
they're<00:00:58.180> easier<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.510> control<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.940> know<00:01:01.060> their

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
they're easier to control you know their

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.750 
they're easier to control you know their
place<00:01:02.350> holders<00:01:02.710> they<00:01:02.920> need<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.190> be<00:01:03.280> bound<00:01:03.550> and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
place holders they need to be bound and

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.430 
place holders they need to be bound and
linked<00:01:04.149> just<00:01:04.420> like<00:01:04.509> everything<00:01:04.750> else<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:05.409> they

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
linked just like everything else so they

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.770 
linked just like everything else so they
do<00:01:05.740> add<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.010> little<00:01:06.310> bit<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.550> overhead<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:07.720> I

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
do add a little bit of overhead but I

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.149 
do add a little bit of overhead but I
think<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.229> long<00:01:08.440> run<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:10.060> help<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
think in the long run they help to to

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.910 
think in the long run they help to to
see<00:01:12.400> what's<00:01:12.580> going<00:01:12.790> on<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.120> scene<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.860> I'm

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
see what's going on in the scene so I'm

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.960 
see what's going on in the scene so I'm
going<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.100> get<00:01:15.190> right<00:01:15.280> into<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.520> here<00:01:15.760> under

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
going to get right into it here under

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to get right into it here under
your<00:01:16.090> create<00:01:16.420> panel<00:01:16.950> under<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:17.979> geometry

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
your create panel under the geometry

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.649 
your create panel under the geometry
group<00:01:19.260> under<00:01:20.260> extended<00:01:20.830> primitives<00:01:21.510> you<00:01:22.510> can

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
group under extended primitives you can

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.120 
group under extended primitives you can
find<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.960> hose<00:01:23.140> right<00:01:23.440> here<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> left<00:01:23.979> in

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
find the hose right here on the left in

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.380 
find the hose right here on the left in
the<00:01:24.220> right-hand<00:01:24.670> column<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:25.990> click<00:01:26.229> on<00:01:26.320> that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the right-hand column so I click on that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.039 
the right-hand column so I click on that
now<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.960> beauty<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.409> hose<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.930> is

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
now the beauty of the hose is in that is

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.090 
now the beauty of the hose is in that is
bound<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.650> object<00:01:33.190> pivots<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.950> we're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
bound to object pivots and what we're

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.850 
bound to object pivots and what we're
going<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.400> is<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:36.549> really<00:01:36.970> quick<00:01:37.150> create

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
going to do is just really quick create

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.890 
going to do is just really quick create
create<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.920> hose<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.990> that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
create a hose just like that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.720 
create a hose just like that
and<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.800> one<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.400> bound

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
and so is this one is going to be bound

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.210 
and so is this one is going to be bound
to<00:01:44.910> object<00:01:45.300> pivots<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.260> is<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
to object pivots what I need to do is is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
to object pivots what I need to do is is
pick<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.730> two<00:01:48.000> objects<00:01:48.510> this<00:01:48.690> house<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.020> going

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
pick the two objects this house is going

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
pick the two objects this house is going
to<00:01:49.200> span<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.030> object<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.450> pose<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to span so this object this pose is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.490 
to span so this object this pose is
going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.350> between<00:01:52.610> point<00:01:53.610> 1<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.120> point<00:01:55.160> 2

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
going to go between point 1 and point 2

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
going to go between point 1 and point 2
just<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.620> that<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.940> notice<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
just like that and you notice that it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
just like that and you notice that it
snaps<00:02:00.600> into<00:02:00.870> place<00:02:00.930> once<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.410> has<00:02:01.560> those

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
snaps into place once it has those

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.870 
snaps into place once it has those
objects<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> very<00:02:05.280> briefly<00:02:05.430> run

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
objects so I'm going to very briefly run

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
objects so I'm going to very briefly run
down<00:02:06.150> some<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> features<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> hose

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
down some of the features of the hose

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.020 
down some of the features of the hose
and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.460> talk<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.759> why

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and then I'm going to talk about why

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.300 
and then I'm going to talk about why
it's<00:02:09.240> still<00:02:09.570> useful<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.290> your<00:02:10.679> pipeline<00:02:10.920> even

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's still useful in your pipeline even

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.740 
it's still useful in your pipeline even
though<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> doesn't<00:02:11.820> really<00:02:12.090> seem<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.630> that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
though it doesn't really seem to be that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
though it doesn't really seem to be that
robust<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.720> quick<00:02:15.930> first<00:02:16.380> under<00:02:17.280> these

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
robust so really quick first under these

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.010 
robust so really quick first under these
binding<00:02:17.820> objects<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.570> parameter

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
binding objects you see this parameter

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.550 
binding objects you see this parameter
here<00:02:19.110> tension<00:02:19.850> tension<00:02:20.850> controls<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:22.230> sort

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
here tension tension controls this sort

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.980 
here tension tension controls this sort
of<00:02:22.680> lead<00:02:23.280> time<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:24.270> all<00:02:24.450> hoses<00:02:24.660> need<00:02:24.959> a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
of lead time because all hoses need a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.080 
of lead time because all hoses need a
little<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.350> lead<00:02:25.730> otherwise<00:02:26.730> they're<00:02:26.940> not

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
little bit of lead otherwise they're not

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.460 
little bit of lead otherwise they're not
going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> respect<00:02:27.570> your<00:02:27.660> geometry<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.290> i<00:02:28.380> turn

going to respect your geometry if i turn
the<00:02:28.740> point<00:02:29.010> 1<00:02:29.420> tension<00:02:30.420> all<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.050> down<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the point 1 tension all the way down you

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.710 
the point 1 tension all the way down you
see<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.550> goes<00:02:32.700> straight<00:02:32.880> from<00:02:33.180> point<00:02:33.570> A

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
see it just goes straight from point A

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.460 
see it just goes straight from point A
to<00:02:33.900> point<00:02:34.140> B<00:02:34.940> point<00:02:35.940> 1<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> point<00:02:36.209> 2<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.720> it

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
to point B point 1 to point 2 and it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
to point B point 1 to point 2 and it
doesn't<00:02:37.709> respect<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.100> geometry<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.760> need<00:02:38.910> at

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
doesn't respect my geometry so I need at

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
doesn't respect my geometry so I need at
least<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.330> little<00:02:39.630> bit<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.020> tension<00:02:40.430> right

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
least a little bit of tension right

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
least a little bit of tension right
there<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.690> also<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.930> used<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.200> simulate

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
there this can also be used to simulate

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.080 
there this can also be used to simulate
gravity<00:02:43.709> if<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.280> object<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.730> upside<00:02:45.060> down

the next major parameters are these
common<00:02:53.310> ones<00:02:53.519> they<00:02:54.000> typically<00:02:54.390> include

common ones they typically include

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.900 
common ones they typically include
things<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.320> number<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.650> cycles<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.310> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
number can make it look pretty comical

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.190 
number can make it look pretty comical
you<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.590> animate<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.130> make<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.400> look<00:03:02.640> like

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
you can animate this make it look like

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.180 
you can animate this make it look like
you<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.290> make<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.530> look<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.739> there's<00:03:04.950> goop

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you know make it look like there's goop

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.120 
you know make it look like there's goop
flowing<00:03:05.760> through<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:07.680> also<00:03:07.800> control

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
flowing through you can also control

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.220 
flowing through you can also control
when<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.340> starts<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.820> ends<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.690> for<00:03:09.840> example<00:03:09.870> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
when it starts and ends so for example I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.720 
when it starts and ends so for example I
could<00:03:10.410> give<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> nice<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.160> know<00:03:11.310> lead<00:03:11.459> time

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
could give a nice you know lead time

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.840 
could give a nice you know lead time
down<00:03:11.970> here<00:03:12.470> lead<00:03:13.470> time<00:03:13.769> up<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
down here lead time up here and the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.900 
down here lead time up here and the
ridges<00:03:15.150> are<00:03:15.300> only<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.780> middle<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.850> that

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
ridges are only in the middle so that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.490 
ridges are only in the middle so that
sometimes<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.390> useful<00:03:18.690> parameter<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.350> need

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
sometimes a useful parameter if you need

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.090 
sometimes a useful parameter if you need
to<00:03:19.560> control<00:03:19.769> how<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.190> looks<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:22.410> next<00:03:22.769> major

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
to control how this looks the next major

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.620 
to control how this looks the next major
feature<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.820> want<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> show<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
of the two and this is useful if you're

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.640 
of the two and this is useful if you're
going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.630> placing<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.019> hose<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.350> along

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
I did it just point 1 point 2 and I'm

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.560 
I did it just point 1 point 2 and I'm
done<00:03:49.610> now<00:03:50.610> what<00:03:50.790> sets<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.239> apart<00:03:51.540> from

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
done now what sets that apart from

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.020 
done now what sets that apart from
splines<00:03:52.139> is<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> spline<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.850> know<00:03:53.970> you

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
splines is that a spline you know you

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.720 
splines is that a spline you know you
have<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.420> manually<00:03:54.750> position<00:03:55.290> each<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
have to manually position each of the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.330 
have to manually position each of the
points<00:03:56.440> even<00:03:57.440> if<00:03:57.530> there's<00:03:57.680> only<00:03:57.769> two<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.190> them

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
points even if there's only two of them

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.000 
points even if there's only two of them
and<00:03:59.049> it<00:04:00.049> doesn't<00:04:00.379> have<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.769> trick

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
and it doesn't have this trick

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.470 
and it doesn't have this trick
inherently<00:04:01.459> so<00:04:01.610> I'm<00:04:01.670> going<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.849> select<00:04:02.060> all<00:04:02.420> of

inherently so I'm going to select all of
my<00:04:02.720> endpoint<00:04:03.500> objects<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.540> if<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.629> want<00:04:05.810> to

my endpoint objects and if I want to

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.000 
my endpoint objects and if I want to
move<00:04:06.019> them<00:04:06.170> around<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:07.280> hose<00:04:07.430> follows<00:04:07.909> it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
move them around the hose follows it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.300 
move them around the hose follows it
which<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.159> perfect<00:04:10.549> for<00:04:10.580> small<00:04:10.879> changes<00:04:11.330> or<00:04:11.810> if

extensible why would I use a hose when I
can<00:04:36.320> just<00:04:36.440> use<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> spline<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.520> spline<00:04:37.789> has

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000

these waves I can turn this down to zero

object because this generates mapping
coordinates<00:05:00.770> or<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.460> can<00:05:01.639> apply<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.910> material

coordinates that applies displacement to
this<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.460> makes<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.760> look<00:05:07.849> exactly<00:05:08.000> as<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.599> want

this it makes it look exactly as I want

and I very highly recommend the 3d total
sci-fi<00:05:12.560> materials<00:05:13.099> because<00:05:13.370> they've<00:05:13.520> got

easily five or six materials that you

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.060 
easily five or six materials that you

of thought kind of think about huh this
is<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.870> little<00:05:33.139> bit<00:05:33.229> faster<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.710> use<00:05:34.479> so<00:05:35.479> until

is a little bit faster to use so until

is a little bit faster to use so until
then<00:05:35.960> happy<00:05:36.919> modelling<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.580> I'll<00:05:37.940> see<00:05:38.060> you
