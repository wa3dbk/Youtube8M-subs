reaction and the reaction review

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.250 
reaction and the reaction review
separately<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.059> time<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.809> some

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
separately this time because I know some

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.179 
separately this time because I know some
people<00:00:16.440> would<00:00:17.310> rather<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.940> watch<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> one

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
people would rather just watch the one

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
people would rather just watch the one
thing<00:00:20.430> than<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:22.020> just

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
thing than the other so they can just

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650 
thing than the other so they can just
choose<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:23.340> video<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:23.699> click<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.330> guess

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
choose which video they click on I guess

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
choose which video they click on I guess
because<00:00:24.869> otherwise<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.619> scroll<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
because otherwise they have to scroll to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.700 
because otherwise they have to scroll to
where<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.880> did<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> review<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.560> know<00:00:28.680> I

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.779 
a way well not worse but you know I
think<00:06:27.750> tall<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.169> would<00:06:28.349> be<00:06:28.560> more<00:06:29.190> than<00:06:29.219> kissing

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
think tall it would be more than kissing

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.350 
think tall it would be more than kissing
for<00:06:30.090> some<00:06:30.300> reason<00:06:30.690> but<00:06:31.110> I'm<00:06:31.289> glad<00:06:31.680> it's<00:06:31.979> not

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
for some reason but I'm glad it's not

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.480 
for some reason but I'm glad it's not
well<00:06:33.360> it's<00:06:33.390> not<00:06:33.960> for<00:06:34.229> this<00:06:34.380> episode<00:06:34.950> already<00:06:35.159> I

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
well it's not for this episode already I

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.730 
well it's not for this episode already I
mean<00:06:35.820> maybe<00:06:36.150> later<00:06:36.750> it<00:06:37.200> would<00:06:37.409> be<00:06:37.530> more

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
mean maybe later it would be more

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.700 
mean maybe later it would be more
