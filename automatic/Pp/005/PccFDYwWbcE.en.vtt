could actually can be ordered to have a
ventilator<00:01:12.360> tray<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.560> could<00:01:13.680> put

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
ventilator tray on it and you could put

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
ventilator tray on it and you could put
a<00:01:14.100> large<00:01:14.940> ventilator<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.690> back<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a large ventilator on the back and it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
a large ventilator on the back and it
would<00:01:16.619> still<00:01:16.830> even<00:01:17.070> articulate<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:18.650> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
would still even articulate with the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
would still even articulate with the
tilt<00:01:19.890> and/or<00:01:20.310> recline<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.360> Omni<00:01:21.780> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
tilt and/or recline the Omni which is a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
tilt and/or recline the Omni which is a
nice<00:01:22.860> display<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.729> also<00:01:23.760> allows<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
nice display but also allows you to have

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.930 
nice display but also allows you to have
specialty<00:01:25.560> inputs<00:01:25.950> directly<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
specialty inputs directly into the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.289 
specialty inputs directly into the
bottom<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.920> device<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:30.000> are<00:01:30.090> two

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bottom of the device so there are two

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.320 
bottom of the device so there are two
ports<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> bottom<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> device<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.790> so

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
ports on the bottom of the device and so

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.690 
ports on the bottom of the device and so
you<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.810> two<00:01:34.290> specialty<00:01:35.070> input<00:01:35.369> devices

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you can have two specialty input devices

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
you can have two specialty input devices
so<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.840> finding<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.799> people

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so what we're finding is is that people

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
so what we're finding is is that people
who<00:01:38.850> are<00:01:38.970> wanting<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> become<00:01:39.540> more<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.869> more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
who are wanting to become more and more

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.789 
who are wanting to become more and more
active<00:01:40.850> may<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:41.909> able<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.420> run<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.960> head<00:01:43.409> control

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
active may be able to run a head control

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.399 
active may be able to run a head control
for<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> while<00:01:45.060> during<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> day<00:01:45.659> until<00:01:46.200> they

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
for a while during the day until they

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
for a while during the day until they
become<00:01:46.799> fatigued<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.670> towards<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> end<00:01:48.600> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
become fatigued and towards the end of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.969 
become fatigued and towards the end of
the<00:01:48.750> day<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.049> may<00:01:49.170> become<00:01:49.470> fatigued<00:01:49.860> but

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the day they may become fatigued but

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
the day they may become fatigued but
they<00:01:50.130> still<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.580> mobility<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.659> could

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
they still want mobility well they could

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440 
they still want mobility well they could
switch<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.500> maybe<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.040> sip-and-puff<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:54.000> maybe

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
switch to maybe a sip-and-puff or maybe

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.230 
switch to maybe a sip-and-puff or maybe
as<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> scanner<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.439> some<00:01:55.920> other<00:01:56.210> device<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
as a scanner or some other device that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
as a scanner or some other device that
doesn't<00:01:57.659> require<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:58.409> energy<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.250> they

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
doesn't require as much energy and they

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
doesn't require as much energy and they
can<00:01:59.400> have<00:01:59.670> both<00:01:59.880> those<00:02:00.119> inputs<00:02:00.509> directly<00:02:00.990> in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
can have both those inputs directly in

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.440 
can have both those inputs directly in
the<00:02:01.259> bottom<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.189> device<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:03.030> also<00:02:03.180> has<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the bottom of the device it also has a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.390 
the bottom of the device it also has a
built-in<00:02:03.840> sip-and-puff<00:02:04.350> port<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.130> don't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
built-in sip-and-puff port so you don't

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.550 
built-in sip-and-puff port so you don't
need<00:02:05.579> an<00:02:05.729> external<00:02:06.150> sip-and-puff<00:02:07.049> device<00:02:07.409> you
