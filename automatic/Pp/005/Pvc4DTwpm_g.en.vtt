00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 All living creatures on Earth need water because of chemical reactions that make life possible 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.809
 in aqueous digestion. 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.549
 Which means that we, the earthly creatures, should drink the water to have it inside us all the time. 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.700
 But ... of the fish like they do? 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.800
 Since they are all within an aqueous solution of any water body, 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.259
 meaning that they are swimming in it, so they do not need to drink it. 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.070
 But it has been seen that some fish actually need to drink water. While others do not. 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 It depends on the fish and in what environment it lives 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.270
 Water, first of all, tends to find balance 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.970
 If you have a membrane through which water can pass, and there are different concentrations 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.410
 of salt on each side, then water will always flow to the most salty side of it 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.750
 membrane, until the concretion is equal on both sides. 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 This means that freshwater fish are easy. 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.370
 Since the salt concentration in their bodies is higher than the concentration of salt in water, 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.930
 then sweet water flows immediately inside, mainly through the vagina, into the circulatory system 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.000
 The fish also drink a little water when they eat - I mean, it's inevitable - but 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.860
 they do not have to actively swallow water. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.829
 But in order to maintain that balance of salt concentration, fish tissues need little 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.130
 salt in them. 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.759
 Even here, chlorine cells are burned at work. 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.450
 These are special cells in fish pups that produce large amounts of a controlling enzyme 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.819
 the flow of dissolved salts - such as sodium and potassium. 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.780
 So in freshwater, these chloride cells work hard to adjust the amount 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.810
 of salt in the circulatory system of fish. 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 Now, salty fish have the opposite problem. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.450
 For most of them, the salt concentration in the water is higher than the concentration 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.149
 in their blood. 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.520
 This means that as they pass water through their wings to breathe, the highest concentration 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.149
 of salt outside their body is constantly sucking water from them. 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.049
 So these fish must drink a lot, which they swallow great. 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.759
 But since the only surrounding water is saline, they have to filter the salt out to do it 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.079
 safe to absorb. 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.560
 A large amount of salt is filtered through the fish's kidneys. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.229
 But even these fish have chlorine cells in their pans. But in their case, 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.109
 these cells continuously pump out salts out of the circulatory system into water which is even more salty. 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.109
 So even though the fish are surrounded by water, no matter where they live, the fish all the time seek 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.359
 to find that balance. 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.789
