for<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.160> for<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.360> go

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
for it all and for this one if you go

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.170 
for it all and for this one if you go
buy<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.730> this

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
buy just the this

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.690 
buy just the this
comforter<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.469> bed<00:02:13.709> it's<00:02:14.069> probably

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
comforter and the bed it's probably

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
comforter and the bed it's probably
around<00:02:14.959> $30<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.109> depends<00:02:16.469> really<00:02:16.829> where<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
around $30 it depends really where I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.429 
around $30 it depends really where I
live<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.609> about<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.030> much<00:02:18.269> but<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:19.109> don't

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
live it's about that much but I don't

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.319 
live it's about that much but I don't
know<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.799> if<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.219> go<00:02:20.430> buy<00:02:20.640> plushies<00:02:21.180> I'll

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
know if if you go buy plushies I'll

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.220 
know if if you go buy plushies I'll
probably<00:02:21.540> cost<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.930> little<00:02:22.019> more<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.870> if

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
probably cost a little more and for if

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.250 
probably cost a little more and for if
you<00:02:25.680> use<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.829> cardboard<00:02:26.280> method<00:02:26.879> I'm<00:02:27.329> not

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you use a cardboard method I'm not

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
you use a cardboard method I'm not
including<00:02:28.650> well<00:02:29.219> including<00:02:29.670> fabrics<00:02:30.180> it'll

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
including well including fabrics it'll

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.509 
including well including fabrics it'll
probably<00:02:30.659> be<00:02:30.900> around<00:02:31.310> um<00:02:33.230> 15<00:02:34.230> dollars<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
probably be around um 15 dollars so this

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.170 
probably be around um 15 dollars so this
is<00:02:35.700> more<00:02:35.819> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.269> consuming<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:38.670> requires

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
is more kind of consuming it it requires

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.979 
is more kind of consuming it it requires
a<00:02:39.689> little<00:02:40.109> bit<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.469> artistic<00:02:40.889> talent<00:02:41.219> but<00:02:42.180> it

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
a little bit of artistic talent but it

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.619 
a little bit of artistic talent but it
is<00:02:43.139> cheaper<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.909> reason<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:45.329> making<00:02:45.450> this

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
is cheaper so the reason I'm making this

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.020 
is cheaper so the reason I'm making this
video<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.319> because<00:02:46.400> during<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.579> summer<00:02:47.609> I'll

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030
