00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.220
 hello friends he presented them a sequential 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.070
 of lights that I have just elaborated 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.690
 we see here we have in the circuit which 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.269
 It consists of three circuits 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.660
 integrated in which will control the 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.029
 sequence of lights and trias 4 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.330
 trias which are for the control of 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.949
 power this circuit does not need the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.039
 external power supply since 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.779
 works directly with 220 volts it 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.779
 connect directly to the network 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.609
 To regulate the voltage, a 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.229
 day two have 12 volts since 12 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.780
 volts is the voltage that will feed 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:45.140
 to this whole circuit we have only 3 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.439
 Integrated circuits in this project do not 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 use this memory we have a circuit 

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:55.880
 integrated integrated 40 40 61 52 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.310
 22 expected 12 of accounts and measured 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.100
 well let's put it into operation for 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.400
 see its operation we are going to plug in 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.400
 the net 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.340
 as we see it starts to work and we go 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.740
 to see that the programs start to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.900
 will automatically change as 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.490
 advancing the change of the lights the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.210
 programs are going to change we see ourselves there 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.880
 how it changes the convention shape 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.340
 of the spotlights has approximately 8 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.670
 different programs we see now here already 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.670
 change 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.030
 and to regulate the control of the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.620
 speed of light bulbs 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.170
 just enough to regulate this 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.990
 power meters let's see 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.829
 speed 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 faster 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.360
 and cuter 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.439
 let's see it is working with the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.610
 lights off to see the effect that is 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 observe in 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.060
 well that's the way it looks 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.920
 how they change the sequence of lights 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.189
 how they change in the programs we have 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.189
 there 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 how is it changes automatically 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.579
 as I tell you this circuit this 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.269
 circuit does not require memories not 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:40.590
 requires memories neither chip nor components 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 that are very expensive only takes three 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.940
 integrated circuits which are 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:50.099
 They are very cheap and work directly 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.849
 with the 220 volt network you have to have 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.500
 care for the operation since all the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.159
 circuit is subject to a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.859
 220 volt voltage and I hope that you 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.040
 have liked this circuit thanks for 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.040
 your attention
