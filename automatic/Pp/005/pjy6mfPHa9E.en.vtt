00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello friends i am dry palms and I 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.630
 I bring a boxing and the review of the ipad 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.300
 is the brand new ipad case that 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.590
 introduced to apple after the event 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.920
 the wwdc and as we see this case has 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.830
 something special and is that it covers so much 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.920
 front as back 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.779
 is a part of the front we have the smart 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.330
 cover and from behind we have a cover 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.450
 protective that is the main lack 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.700
 that I noticed the smart cover that 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.730
 it protected the back as we see 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.400
 it has a price of 49 euros or 49 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.640
 dollars and the wrapper is pretty 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.070
 simple then we go to it over here 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.280
 behind we have a small tab with 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.129
 which if we throw 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.770
 we will be able to unblock what would be 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.790
 access to 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.790
 this area 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.440
 and once lifted what we do is 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.240
 that we removed it in this part of here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.110
 We have some small instructions for 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.390
 know how it is and here we have the cover 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.000
 specifically to the altar as we see this 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.840
 compost because as I said by two 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.470
 parts inside has this little 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.970
 cardboard thing to keep the shape 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.650
 entering the river we realize 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.570
 that this case is composed of two 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.729
 parts a part that would equal the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.539
 smart cover and another part is equivalent to 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.610
 ipad protector your backside like 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.500
 we see the part that belongs to the smart 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 they cover the same functions 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.190
 that the individual piece both in 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.020
 horizontal position as in position 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.330
 vertical also surprised me 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.630
 rather than the material of which they are 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.670
 made inside is much denser than 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.920
 which we can find in the frame 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.289
 d is a singular thing that I like because 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.700
 it does not scratch on our ipad to the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.500
 time to insert our room 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.470
 said cover that we have in place the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.850
 edges on the left first 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.900
 making sure they fit well and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.390
 then do 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.880
 on the edges of the part of the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 right by forcing the corner a bit 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.270
 truth is that the method is not very good 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.070
 because you have to go to press the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.930
 xunta and crystal and that I did not like 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.000
 much 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.189
 at the top we have the entrance 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.530
 for since a bit is blocked 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.420
 hole for the microphone 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.890
 we also have buttons for the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.719
 on or the rise and fall of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 volume and holes for the camera and the 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.849
 blocking of orientation or silence by 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 another part we have a slit for 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.700
 speak the speakers and also another for 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.019
 the connector of the 30-pin jack by the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.090
 back we will have by the 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.760
 information of each one in this case there is 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.829
 peace is brand product network starting with 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.389
 the integrations of the sleeve we 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.939
 we find that on its edges it has 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.769
 a pretty misshapen and poorly done finish 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.480
 The truth is that I do not like anything because 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.519
 Security gives nothing in terms of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.409
 duration and resistance and well 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.330
 buttons that incorporate so they work 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.580
 fairly good 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.200
 the space they leave for the button 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.560
 blocking the truth is that it makes it very difficult 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.680
 to upload it as you can see in the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.620
 image and on the other hand the camera although 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 He hides nothing is off the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.730
 microphone has a pretty space 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.030
 reduced and as for the jack jack 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.100
 It is also off center and does not fit well 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.510
 the speaker is shifted up 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:33.050
 covering the original and also the connector 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.420
 jack is also displaced and does not 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.070
 can connect quite well another of the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.440
 defects that we can see is that there 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.930
 slack is to say that it does not fit the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.410
 perfection and the sleeve is bigger than 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.690
 the iPad itself the truth is that it is a 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.690
 chores that the smart can not be removed 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.880
 cover not even rolling you can 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.610
 do and it's quite annoying in some 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.190
 tasks that you really do not want to have 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.110
 there also this case lacks the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.330
 property of sticking to the back 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.510
 so that if we put it behind it is 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.640
 falling constantly here you have a 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.640
 example of the property that I mean 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.680
 another thing that has not 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.900
 liked is that to be able to open the smart 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.630
 cover and access our ipad as there is 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.210
 to put the nail literally because 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.610
 If we can not not open and that makes 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.430
 in the end we end up deteriorating and not 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.160
 it's worth it if you look at it too is 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.470
 a property that within the framework of 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.270
 original was pretty much solved and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.310
 It was quite simple to open and close 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.070
 and to end the criticisms I 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.440
 I would like to mention the fact that it has 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.810
 very little stability when we put it 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.430
 so country now is to say for 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.340
 play content make a 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.800
 video call we see that the ipad has very 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.380
 little stability what causes that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.290
 move and swing a lot more than 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.060
 with the frame of the original and that you 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.310
 may fall in some case as 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.140
 it has already happened to me is something that the truth is 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.970
 that leaves a lot to be desired of the 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.670
 found just in case you have not noticed 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.860
 it is a pure and harsh criticism towards this 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.690
 product of the apple that the truth that 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.700
 I was disappointed a lot the idea in 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.020
 general is good but in the material and 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.150
 the way they are made and the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.150
 price is worth more than I what 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.580
 I'm going to do is change 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.260
 I'm unmarked see solitary and a cover 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.030
 protective third part of that 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.860
 way I will not be able to do is link 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.600
 and unbind the like and whenever 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.000
 I say it seems unfortunate that apple has 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.500
 produced this type of covers because it is 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.120
 that the truth is that quality is not 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.950
 comparable with most of its 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.630
 products and that's why I brought this 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.460
 review so you can know a bit about me 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.440
 opinion and what you can find if 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.260
 the purchase is remember to subscribe to the 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.150

 I am arroba pablo marry on twitter and
