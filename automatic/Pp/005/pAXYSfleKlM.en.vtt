00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
looks like I did it a little too fast

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.450 
looks like I did it a little too fast
cuz<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> can't<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:40.410> tell<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.860> I'm<00:00:40.980> doing

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
cuz you can't really tell what I'm doing

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.770 
cuz you can't really tell what I'm doing
inside<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.300> point<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:44.670> um<00:00:45.200> met<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.410> dremel

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
inside some point but um met them dremel

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
inside some point but um met them dremel
so<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> doesn't<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.410> any<00:00:49.590> paint<00:00:49.860> rub<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
