 Bad Vilbel 4 set for 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.630
 digital SLR cameras on analog cameras 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.070
 It's a movie for all models 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 means 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.649
 you can see here on the product page next to Peter Striebeck

 the pilot or fly I would not like me so much too much 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.870
 say we are still a lot of good wings 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.130
 Percent simplistically said that the one offender is the community 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.360
 extremely small aperture which had extreme depth of field 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.870
 Accordingly, it is still female 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.250
 like the technical thing that actually stands behind that too, of course 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.870
 Logically, network find 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.090
 she knew that she was not just there to describe the product Markus 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.310
 somehow part of a large part also and percent at the end 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.310
 which one then attaches to the camera 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.620
 they now have the pinola active or aperture 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.660
 in close-up 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.090
 On the outside there is a raw material in Kaufdorf satirical way 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450
 Program on what you get from the ladies 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.440
 Canal works did not get stuck, especially since she is attached to Clifford 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.670
 then the message border with that weeks still in the middle of me 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.690
 knows that you can see that is Volkmar Klein 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.490
 and that culprits are rising 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.890
 simply insert a camera 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.590
 you click 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 my can still break a ball 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 As the Canon said, this movie is for all the models we have in the shop 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.490
 offering exemplary is this movie 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.360
 because no models is the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.080
 the procedure as follows 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.870
 to lose weight objectively 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.090
 the PIN picks up easy 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 screw on 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 a turn 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.970
 already sees the whole thing 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 Of course, the camera has to be set manually many times 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 the exposure time it is also today life in the forest moss 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.830
 So that's what you say 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.540
 also the Altena reasonably then perhaps manually by hand 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.540
 Set fight with delivered here is a list 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.970
 within this relationship can see 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.089
 we are so 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.569
 Recommendation decision Fallenbrunnen wants to lead why 100 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.499

 Games Lottsiepen says a radiant day only with National Film about 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.689
 three seconds so I realized that you can do it 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.349
 So do not try it for yourself because it's better to do it 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.409
 Exposure times ComCom 15 seconds and more 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.779
 but that's just synonymous of how high you set so and 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.219
 Percent I also charge for outside not circumstances tripod is natural 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.889
 soon to run well love for the water Pino published Hoenig tell 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.519
