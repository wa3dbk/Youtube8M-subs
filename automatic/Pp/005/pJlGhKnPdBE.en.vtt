they also fixed an issue in story mode
where<00:02:44.900> Titan<00:02:45.350> would<00:02:45.560> blow<00:02:45.830> up<00:02:46.100> when<00:02:46.340> stored<00:02:46.700> in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
where Titan would blow up when stored in

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.490 
where Titan would blow up when stored in
a<00:02:46.880> hangar<00:02:47.270> that<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.750> true<00:02:48.050> every<00:02:48.290> time<00:02:48.470> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
a hangar that is so true every time I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.520 
a hangar that is so true every time I
would<00:02:48.680> start<00:02:48.920> at<00:02:49.040> tightening<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> hangar<00:02:50.120> arm

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
would start at tightening the hangar arm

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.230 
would start at tightening the hangar arm
the<00:02:51.530> next<00:02:51.800> time<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> would<00:02:52.190> come<00:02:52.430> back<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.670> see

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
the next time I would come back to see

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.970 
the next time I would come back to see
it<00:02:53.360> spawned<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.230> wings<00:02:54.470> would<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.800> hitting

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
it spawned the wings would be hitting

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.800 
it spawned the wings would be hitting
against<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.880> hangar<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.420> then<00:02:56.660> I'll<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
against the hangar and then I'll just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.650 
against the hangar and then I'll just
blow<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:58.250> also<00:02:58.430> added<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:59.060> if<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.420> player

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
blow up they also added this if a player

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.930 
blow up they also added this if a player
has<00:02:59.840> already<00:03:00.080> ranked<00:03:00.560> up<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> rank<00:03:01.430> 20

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
has already ranked up to a rank 20

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.550 
has already ranked up to a rank 20
they'll<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.510> given<00:03:02.870> an<00:03:02.990> option<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.350> skip

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
they'll be given an option to skip

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.949 
they'll be given an option to skip
tutorial<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.310> believe<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:04.880> means<00:03:05.240> for

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
tutorial so I believe this means for

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.930 
tutorial so I believe this means for
example<00:03:06.050> if<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.680> have<00:03:06.830> one<00:03:07.070> character<00:03:07.610> over

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
example if you have one character over

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.880 
example if you have one character over
level<00:03:08.300> 20<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.930> decide<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.380> create<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.709> new

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
level 20 and you decide to create a new

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.560 
level 20 and you decide to create a new
character<00:03:10.430> instead<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.300> through<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
character instead of going through the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.870 
character instead of going through the
whole<00:03:11.750> tutorial<00:03:12.110> bullshit<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.520> just

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
whole tutorial bullshit you can just

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.370 
whole tutorial bullshit you can just
skip<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.240> which<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.600> actually<00:03:14.750> pretty<00:03:15.140> cool

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
skip it which is actually pretty cool

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.570 
skip it which is actually pretty cool
it's<00:03:15.560> going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.740> help<00:03:15.830> with<00:03:16.040> other<00:03:16.190> glitches

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
it's going to help with other glitches

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.360 
it's going to help with other glitches
and<00:03:16.970> make<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.600> easier<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.260> do<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:19.190> also

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
and make it easier to do and they also

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.610 
and make it easier to do and they also
fixed<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:20.090> guess<00:03:20.390> not<00:03:20.540> enough<00:03:20.930> fixed<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:21.500> they

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
fixed I guess not enough fixed but they

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.250 
fixed I guess not enough fixed but they
added<00:03:21.980> back<00:03:22.190> these<00:03:22.430> cars<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.630> cars<00:03:24.080> that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
added back these cars to the cars that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.290 
added back these cars to the cars that
you<00:03:24.380> can<00:03:24.560> store<00:03:24.860> into<00:03:25.190> your<00:03:25.340> garages<00:03:25.670> such<00:03:26.090> as
