with<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> downspout<00:00:35.340> extensions<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.570> at

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with the downspout extensions here at

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
with the downspout extensions here at
the<00:00:36.719> bottom<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.460> well<00:00:38.520> having

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the bottom so it's all very well having

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
the bottom so it's all very well having
gutters<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> water<00:00:39.989> dumped<00:00:40.530> out

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
gutters but if the water dumped out

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
gutters but if the water dumped out
directly<00:00:41.190> next<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> house<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.210> and

directly next to the house here and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
directly next to the house here and
pulled<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.320> would<00:00:43.500> sink<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.460> ground

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
pulled it would sink in to the ground

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760

next<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> footers<00:00:45.870> causing<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
next to the footers causing the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490 
next to the footers causing the
clay-based<00:00:47.070> soil<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.030> expand<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.320> when

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
clay-based soil to expand and then when

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.720 
clay-based soil to expand and then when
it<00:00:49.590> stopped<00:00:49.860> raining<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.430> dry<00:00:50.700> out

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it stopped raining it would dry out

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.209 
it stopped raining it would dry out
contract<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> shifting<00:00:52.500> constantly

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
contract and the shifting constantly

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
contract and the shifting constantly
would<00:00:53.879> would<00:00:54.420> cause<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> foundation<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> move

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
would would cause the foundation to move

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
would would cause the foundation to move
for<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> extra<00:00:57.120> extensions<00:00:57.690> help<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> get<00:00:58.230> all

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
for the extra extensions help to get all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.250 
for the extra extensions help to get all
of<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.859> rain<00:00:59.100> water<00:00:59.340> away<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> house

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of that rain water away from the house

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
of that rain water away from the house
which<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> very<00:01:01.770> important<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:03.120> another

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
which is very important then another

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.020 
which is very important then another
thing<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.559> skirting<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.700> did<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
thing is the skirting when we did this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
thing is the skirting when we did this
skirting<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.140> what's<00:01:07.380> called<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
skirting we put in what's called a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
skirting we put in what's called a
moisture<00:01:08.430> barrier<00:01:08.610> behind<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.659> stucco<00:01:10.080> style

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
moisture barrier behind the stucco style

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
moisture barrier behind the stucco style
skirting<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.970> thick<00:01:12.270> black

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
skirting so there's a very thick black

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.050 
skirting so there's a very thick black
polyurethane<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.159> goes<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
polyurethane that actually goes down a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
polyurethane that actually goes down a
foot-and-a-half<00:01:15.780> below<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> soil<00:01:17.220> level

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
foot-and-a-half below the soil level

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.810 
foot-and-a-half below the soil level
here<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> comes<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> J<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.369> any<00:01:20.549> water

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here and comes out at a J so any water

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
here and comes out at a J so any water
that<00:01:21.119> does<00:01:21.360> sink<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.900> next<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.470> house

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that does sink in next to the house

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.490 
that does sink in next to the house
would<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.640> penetrate<00:01:24.299> towards<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> footers

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
would not penetrate towards the footers

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.280 
would not penetrate towards the footers
and<00:01:25.650> into<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> crawlspace

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
and into the crawlspace

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
and into the crawlspace
but<00:01:28.290> also<00:01:28.710> oil<00:01:28.829> has<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> natural<00:01:29.610> level<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
but also oil has a natural level of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
but also oil has a natural level of
moisture<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.590> want<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.070> sure<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
moisture so we want to make sure that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.210 
moisture so we want to make sure that
the<00:01:32.700> crawlspace<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:34.020> adequate<00:01:34.530> venting<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the crawlspace has adequate venting and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
the crawlspace has adequate venting and
the<00:01:35.759> air<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.750> pass<00:01:36.990> through<00:01:37.259> underneath<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the air can pass through underneath the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
the air can pass through underneath the
house<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.420> install<00:01:39.810> these

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
house and to do that we install these

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.880 
house and to do that we install these
vents<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:41.220> help<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.140> exactly<00:01:43.649> that

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
vents which help to just do exactly that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.530 
vents which help to just do exactly that
they<00:01:44.100> catch<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> breeze<00:01:44.790> from<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> outside

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they catch the breeze from the outside

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
they catch the breeze from the outside
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.229> circulate<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> air<00:01:47.250> underneath

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
and then circulate the air underneath

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
and then circulate the air underneath
the<00:01:47.850> house<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> moldy

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the house so you don't get that moldy

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
the house so you don't get that moldy
smell<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.430> open<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.110> closets<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
smell when you open up your closets that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.710
