00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.059
 you need to distinguish 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.059
 so you need a replacement for jonas 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.739
 security of subsidy 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.739
 under these conditions he 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.009
 Paulo 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.669
 has work songs led by we have santos ferreira 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.320
 That's not it 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 we created the world of dreams 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.240
 we take the person has this dream 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 and she sees how desperate she is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.150
 and in vilarinho 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
 It's not the most trustworthy thing in the world. 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 even so require it 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.630
 I think we found out is that the home team 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.580
 this is a disservice 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 after you leave 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 are real stories with distinction 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 I do not know that we realize something very strange. 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 worked for this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 the Swiss 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 I'm in control here. 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 Imagine if I was 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.069
 You do not have to be afraid of dreaming of something bigger.
