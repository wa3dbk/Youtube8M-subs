sitting outside daily and due to the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.139 
sitting outside daily and due to the
elements<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.039> just<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> little<00:01:17.610> raspy<00:01:19.130> so

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
elements it's just a little raspy so

first<00:01:21.149> what<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.690> is<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.050> apply<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.410> Nano

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
first what we do is we apply the Nano

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.200 
first what we do is we apply the Nano
shine<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.539> surface<00:01:24.899> areas<00:01:25.229> saturating<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.609 
thoroughly and with no pressure at all
you're<00:01:31.289> gonna<00:01:31.470> take<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.270> nano<00:01:33.270> towel<00:01:33.619> which

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you're gonna take the nano towel which

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
you're gonna take the nano towel which
has<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.630> auto<00:01:38.210> skinner<00:01:39.210> nano<00:01:39.540> skin

has the auto skinner nano skin
technology<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:42.030> lightly<00:01:42.330> go

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
technology on it and just lightly go

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.429 
technology on it and just lightly go
back<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> forth<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> surface<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:46.260> go

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
back and forth over the surface you go

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.310 
back and forth over the surface you go
one<00:01:46.710> direction<00:01:47.900> go<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.080> other<00:01:49.200> direction

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320

all<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.380> was<00:03:18.590> achieved<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.190> using<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:20.320> 12

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
all this was achieved just using this 12

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.130 
all this was achieved just using this 12
inch<00:03:21.500> by<00:03:21.709> 12<00:03:22.010> inch<00:03:22.190> Nano<00:03:22.880> skin<00:03:23.360> towel<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:26.140> has

this new technology on it and it just

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.120 
this new technology on it and it just
man<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:34.760> makes<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.090> difference
