00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.670
 welcome him on mac this report for 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.180
 the test of new honda cr-v a lip 6 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.189
 120 horsepower turbo diesel 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 a model developed for the market 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.300
 European 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.509
 in two-wheel drive to compete 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.640
 the qashqai sporting and other hyundai 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.969
 ix35 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.160
 here is the new engine 1 8 620 horsepower 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.730
 16 valves and direct injection with ramp 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.410
 town 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.780
 inside there is a board of 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.700
 word edge modern design very elegant 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 with a gear lever located at 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.400
 wear well placed hand so 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 a double screen gps color plus 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.079
 very nice onboard computer but not 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.899
 necessarily very easy to use 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.850
 especially since we have many buttons 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.540
 level of the steering wheel so we get lost a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.070
 little bit are we going to look at the finish that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.140
 is pretty successful i would say it's at 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.700
 level of an x ​​35 or a sporting case at 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.000
 Korean level here it's stuffed 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.399
 on the other hand if it is rigid and despite 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.030
 the presence of rest I do not know who is 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.549
 really very good 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.700
 unfortunately often the knee comes 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.440
 rather in contact with the rigid part 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.010
 in the back we have a nice space 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.110
 to the legs 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.850
 even at the central square 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 since there is no tunnel so we can 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.570
 really exploit the three places the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.299
 trunk with a large tailgate is not less 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.640
 580 9 liters of volume 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.000
 so we have a lot of height 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.760
 loading a nice width behind 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 the wheel arches and we have two 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.860
 little weeks is here that allow 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.860
 to cast off one by magic the bank is 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.930
 completely flat we find the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.640
 traditional needle counters with 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.619
 the board computer in the middle the little 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.920
 con tour on the left we have a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.530
 touch 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.110
 aecon and when pressed it allows 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.000
 to have the economic mode so serve 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.040
 a little green it is mostly seen 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.049
 by night 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.290
 go we'll start we'll see what 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.290
 it gives 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.270
 he takes it is he turns qian 6 to 12 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.180
 hours 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 continued draft 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.350
 we do not hear badly 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.540
 we will see if it is breath 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.360
 at low speed we will put ourselves in 6th all 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.900
 right now I'm at least 2 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 500 rounds 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:53.610
 the phenomenon of not too nasty floods 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:56.970
 it goes well so here is above 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.549
 3000 there are a few more nerves going the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.540
 to push a little further he is out of breath 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.540
 not let go at 4 me 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.780
 it's an engine that agree to take 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.790
 five thousand rounds that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.920
 it's not bad and diesel is 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.190
 is on a six-speed gearbox 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.480
 she is well guided well staged and therefore 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.480
 in the end we have a very good compromise 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.410
 then obviously like all suv 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.860
 compact is not as agile as 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.560
 sedan 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.319
 it takes a little more roll but that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.110
 it's well guided we have a direction 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.270
 who is gentle who favors comfort 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.800
 driving precision but good on 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.780
 know where we're going anyway huh that's enough 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.780
 it lived that is typical comfort 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.209
 the performances announced by honda 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.420
 are better than those of the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.239
 competition the consumption also that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.280
 arrives late on the market with a 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.480
 successful product 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.480
 see you soon on mac this report 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.250
 and we will take the opportunity to thank the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.959
 great bernard has again 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.360
 thanks a lot for nothing to see spin a 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.360
 little help and it's not over 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.200
 of nothing sir fontanier
