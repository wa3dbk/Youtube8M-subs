00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.129
 Our Bonnie 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.150
 Here's a look at the trance about the essence value. 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.150
 Now, the light is god 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:22.640
 There are two objects. 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:27.699
 I'm in the background and searching like a curtain. 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.699
 I have a member tool and let me in. Computer example 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:37.440
 Lambert 2a trs 6b gives me about 0.5 color 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.850
 Change the light yellow. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.850
 That's once the rendering. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.280
 So as you can see in front of party jaetekeu imjang 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 It's now linked to a curtain-like object. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.070
 You can use it to express curtain or thin paper . 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370
 Seems to 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.190
 And one thing. 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.500
 Now, because of this thin object, 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.540
 Just by raising the price by stress, I was able to express shadows. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.020
 Now this time 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.530
 So, and a bit thicker objects 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.530
 About 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.770
 I think it's rendering and rendering the member tools the same once again . 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.550
 This time is no different. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.550
 Give me while sleeping shadows 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:42.039
 Objects with two thick To go to a good light , 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.160
 Now, Smackshadow is in bad shape. 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:51.180
 If you open the Meat 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:54.920
 Wigan cache is one who spreads it to the free juice itjyo the shadow of the data bus 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.920
 Turn on NewsRad Shadow 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.030
 My Render Settings 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.600
 If you look, you are only attacks on the software Shinko rate cut not to geudieo 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.600
 Check it out. 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.920
 5 I'll do it. 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.530
 Here again because there is no change 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.060
 character 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.060
 I do not have trans-plus 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.930
 4 points 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.190
 Very fine value 0.002 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.580
 Nowadays numerically Bokeh no trans fence can be a little sense to our eyes 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.580
 I have. 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.760
 There's a lot of people, so there's something different. 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:52.420
 Now let's save the Lambert tool again . 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.420
 Atlas is a value to be written I'll get 0.55 feet Transport sense of depth 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.610
 Then who is the tosylate 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:10.019
 Here now itneyo struck the shadows gives me 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.019
 So I wonder ah four point lead 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.300
 Now this time , 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.650
 The shadows are ever cried 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.650
 I'll re- arrange this. 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.860
 If I try some coffee , 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.430
 Let the book be the focus value 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.550
 I'll lower it to posco. 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.550
 0 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.450
 Judges give me such a lot of wo sorry 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.330
 I'll walk you guys. 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:10.530
 Give the skin already flexible before you give the white light to the front now 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:16.109
 I can see a little widened. 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.709
 This itneungeo'm astonished to see that the mind and the beach 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.820
 Party and transformers true sense TEPS value 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:27.240
 Now the thickness of the object is related to 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.080
 You can check the grid from the front. 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:36.170
 When you see this, open a regional grid saw the party as a bad one 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.100
 The object of the grid 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:45.710
 I've been looking for almost two . 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.170
 I'm thinking a few bats Khan our trans-sds Lambert tree now 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.200
 Give gas 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.330
 0.9 is slightly lower than 1 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.050
 It's rough. 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:02.980
 Let's think about this. 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.980
 You can use it by adjusting the x value of the frame. 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.530
 now 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.530
 An object with this light coming in 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.360
 The shadows are coming in stronger. 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.810
 At this time 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.790
 The ambient value is negative 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.900
 Make it look like a color crab . 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.900
 I think I'll make it again. 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:43.560
 Here now it seems out similar 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.560
 It's a transformer.
