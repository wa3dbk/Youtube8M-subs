00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.150
 very good to all three gamer and 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.370
 we are here to teach a little how 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.349
 save the league of legends had 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 thought of doing just one video on this topic 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.379
 but I think it's going to be too 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.090
 complicated or advanced if we never know or 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.090
 we have never saved 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.490
 and do it all in a video so I'm going to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.680
 make 23 videos the first one that will be this 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 that will be like basically keeping said 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.140
 client so that they avoid you and have 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.750
 a little visible on the map another one that will be 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.910
 how to save in a very effective way and 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.489
 advanced taking into account the range of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 war and all that and the third one that will be 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.160
 as against saving that is saved in 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.489
 the sites to annoy the team 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.140
 enemy the walk or has he put so 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.239
 let's start with the basic tutorial 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.850
 on guard in the first place so you do not 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.329
 make us that in porto with let's say a 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 war here 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.620
 that what makes us is that the enemy 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.739
 that will come for your world around here 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.810
 we'll see it so much if it comes by tribes it's 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.780
 tell of this herb if I'm up 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 we will see it and if the change comes by 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.400
 by river is to say here and also goes up 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.340
 we will see it so when we will have a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.320
 little margin of error to be able 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.330
 pull back as I said this 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.600
 is the basic guide are the uars very very 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.700
 basic we need to avoid gan 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 that you then in the advanced guide because 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.740
 we will explain how to place the guards 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.770
 how many to make it practically 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.270
 impossible that we give that the without seeing the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.630
 enemy 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.750
 then in mid we will also place war 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.490
 here in this area or this area is usually 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.850
 place more in this area here entering 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.890
 a bit like that also a little bit like like the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.469
 tops the jungle will come from its enemy crib 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.750
 and we can stay so much around here that 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.310
 here in is because of this middle grass and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.979
 so that with this guard we get it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.179
 see also we get to see if by the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.030
 otherwise decides to enter from behind 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.380
 he will come here we will see him 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 because we have something here and here 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 we can know if he is going to enter us 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.300
 here 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.740
 or if on the contrary what he wants most 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.000
 do anything against jungle or romans the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.650
 blue so we'll see what's going on here 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 so it would be one of the basic wars 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.020
 as I say this is not the best way to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.230
 save half that we 'll see in the guide 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.050
 of the advanced guard guide but for 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.180
 start and avoid some bankers like this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.630
 principle then know guards of this 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.450
 way in the truth is that pretty good 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.650
 here we will also put a bar in what 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.159
 this area has been 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.590
 a little too to avoid the same thing that 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.260
 do not enter by certain places is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.379
 say the enemy man will have his 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.760
 cage that is is the same here do not you 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.530
 will enter because it has a distance 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.069
 very very large until I would arrive towards 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.359
 but here you find that you can 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.849
 enter through this grass and you would already be 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.829
 watching with this guards placed if you 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.200
 enter here likewise you would see that 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.120
 it has come for the jungle 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.489
 and there was no problem also it 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.290
 Climb up the TamesÃ­ River I came like this going up 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 by river because you will be able to see it 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.370
 thanks to this guard so you have all 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.019
 this guard zone gives what it allows you 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.140
 so be a little more secure in the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.140
 medium 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.230
 and then a bot we will also place 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.230
 our watts 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.340
 and we are going to place a guard in this area 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.130
 to prevent the enemy from coming by 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.900
 here 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.300
 and here it will come and here we would already be 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.720
 seeing if on the contrary it comes by 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.640
 tribes but he decides to come here because 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.500
 we will also see it and to be a 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.870
 little safer to avoid it out 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.750
 that or we'll put a second here in 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.510
 this zone 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.950
 well it is really difficult that we 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.860
 do that because if he comes here 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.180
 back by the opposite of contrary 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.880
 here and now we go in tribes if we 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.370
 we can throw back that travels that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.880
 go down by river we'll see it with stewart like this 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.920
 that we basically have the whole vision 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.820
 as I said there are other tactics a little 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.799
 more complex that allow you to take out the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.829
 maximum match to what is the range of 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.540
 war does not and it allows you doing certain 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.730
 things so it's very very difficult for you 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.070
 can be left so we 'll see this 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.860
 also in upcoming videos simply 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.700
 keep in mind for now this that for 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.330
 for bots it would be quite interesting 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.909
 have two wars this here 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.099
 for that to see it from the river and to see the 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:48.909
 out of this this is very very very 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.340
 necessary this is almost practically 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:54.370
 life or that this is why if or if this one 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.680
 you can already put it good depends but if 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.599
 you want to be safer than more 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.939
 protected in bot recommends you do not put 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.990
 both this one and this one and so it is not 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:07.300
 the best way but you have a great one 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.270
 great vision and it will be difficult to have 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.669
 that smith as we said would be needed 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.380
 one here to see it to see if it's coming 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.300
 on that side 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.670
 and another on the other side as we have 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.050
 marked let's review let's review 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.789
 it's never bad to review them more 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.320
 and another as we said then what 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.850
 we would place here 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.470
 we must be careful that we put it 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.560
 in the grass I also have not said it but 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.790
 you have to be careful to put the grass 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.830
 because if the guard we can put the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.780
 grass and the enemy enters the grass 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.480
 we are not going to see it because it is as if 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.270
 was a normal pass not then not 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.710
 we would see it and then finally we go 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.760
 to place another place where we said 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.760
 what is in this corner 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.470
 and well with this we would finish what is 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.170
 the manual or guard guide very basic 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.050
 these softwares that are very necessary and 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.150
 very basic to avoid gang that you 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.620
 and well with this we avoid that a little 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.120
 cover the whole cover the mid and cover the 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.430
 boat and the truth is that we have with 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.129
 these wash even if it's a very 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.039
 basic we can talk a lot 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.599
 bankers and above all we have what 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.419
 the river is being very well guard 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.669
 we have enough things so good 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.919
 see you in the next video where 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.919
 we will explain a little more this thoroughly 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.629
 a more advanced guide and so they 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.340
 I hope you already know that you can subscribe 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.840
 to the channel if you are not where I like the 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.780
 video but we will do what 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.409
 you want a greeting and see you in the 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.409
 next video
