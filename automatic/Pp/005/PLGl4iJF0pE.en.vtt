that's normal I couldn't fix them a
hundred<00:02:52.170> percent<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:52.920> close<00:02:53.850> enough<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.480> if

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hundred percent but close enough and if

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.960 
hundred percent but close enough and if
they<00:02:55.019> lose<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:55.800> if<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.980> end<00:02:56.190> up<00:02:56.340> losing<00:02:56.580> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
they lose then if I end up losing a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.740 
they lose then if I end up losing a
little<00:02:57.150> bit<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.360> curl<00:02:57.959> or<00:02:58.860> bounce<00:02:59.630> what<00:03:00.630> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
little bit of curl or bounce what you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
little bit of curl or bounce what you
can<00:03:00.930> do<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:02.989> push<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.980> her<00:03:05.610> head

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
can do is just push it up on her head
