that<00:03:15.620> tech<00:03:15.950> available<00:03:17.140> xlab<00:03:18.140> still<00:03:18.470> with<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
that tech available xlab still with that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160 
that tech available xlab still with that
first<00:03:18.920> sell<00:03:19.130> it<00:03:19.250> for<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> stalker<00:03:19.700> not<00:03:20.510> really

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
first sell it for a stalker not really

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.690 
first sell it for a stalker not really
any<00:03:21.320> reason<00:03:21.740> oh<00:03:21.950> he<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.070> canceled<00:03:22.610> that

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
any reason oh he just canceled that

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.640 
any reason oh he just canceled that
second<00:03:23.060> gas<00:03:23.240> and<00:03:23.510> just<00:03:23.660> dropped<00:03:23.990> what<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.560> he

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
second gas and just dropped what is he

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.010 
second gas and just dropped what is he
gonna<00:03:24.740> drop<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> second<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.640> third<00:03:25.910> gate<00:03:26.300> looks

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
gonna drop a second and third gate looks

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.480 
gonna drop a second and third gate looks
like<00:03:27.140> he's<00:03:27.260> priming<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.740> a<00:03:27.800> fourth<00:03:28.040> gate<00:03:28.280> oh

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
like he's priming for a fourth gate oh

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.090 
like he's priming for a fourth gate oh

gasping<00:03:35.510> worked<00:03:35.690> in<00:03:35.810> actually<00:03:36.290> he<00:03:36.470> did<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.580> he

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
gasping worked in actually he did so he

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.510 
gasping worked in actually he did so he
is<00:03:38.030> probably<00:03:38.300> thinking<00:03:39.010> some<00:03:40.010> sort<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.310> tech

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520

went right here I not even sure if it

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
went right here I not even sure if it
would<00:04:25.669> actually<00:04:25.790> reach<00:04:26.120> this

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630
