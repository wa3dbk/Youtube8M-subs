00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone today I will teach you to be 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.860
 Exfoliator for sugar lips is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.440
 comparable to the one they sell between secret or 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.010
 of borisov and they can do it from their 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 home 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 Exfoliate daily has benefits 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 like softer lips remove cells 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.860
 dead comment clean deep 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
 of impurities oxygenate the skin and 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.340
 stimulate the creation of new cells 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.609
 the ingredients that they will need 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.289
 first of all it's Vaseline or also 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.289
 known as pure petrolatum 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.560
 we are also going to need brown sugar 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.589
 organic almond oil and 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:44.329
 finally to give it an extra touch 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.399
 flavoring or vanilla extract this 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.370
 they find it in the ingredients of 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.469
 cook now for the tools let's go 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.710
 to need something super simple a plate 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.530
 a deep container a coffee spoon 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.600
 or a small spoon and finally 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.489
 they need a container this is one of 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.379
 metal where you see big steam but you can 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.699
 be plastic or glass whatever 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.330
 that they have in their hands that are not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.030
 using 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 and we will also need alcohol between 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 70 degrees and 90 to disinfect and a couple 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.710
 of cotton balls 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.800
 Now, get down to work , first thing 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.710
 I'm going to do is I'm going to put my plate 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 or container my spoon and everything close to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 where I'm going to be doing this and I'm going to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.200
 drink a little alcohol and I'm going to get wet 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.350
 the cotton with this I'm going to use it 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.960
 to disinfect the spoon girl or 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.760
 coffee spoon this is because really 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.190
 just wash it with soap does not guarantee 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.070
 that there are no germs now I'm going to take 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.900
 my brown sugar and we choose sugar 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.150
 brunette by the size of the beads 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.330
 because it 's enough to exfoliate and I'm going 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.210
 to take a teaspoon that is not at 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.729
 but have a little bit of this 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 of dome and I'll put it on my plate 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.970
 Now I'm going to take my Vaseline or 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.860
 pure petrolatum and I'm going to take half 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.120
 tablespoon 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 this is going to be like the base of the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.790
 exfoliating and is what is going to do that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.290
 everything comes together sugar and others now 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.630
 I'm going to take my almond oil 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.170
 organic this super cheap can you 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 find in any pharmacy or place 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.640
 supermarket store and I will use 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 10 droplets the almond oil makes 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.740
 that is extra moisturizing and more creamy 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.660
 so if you want it to be even more 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.630
 liquid your pasta and more creamy can 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.970
 add more if they want and finally and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.530
 this is totally optional it is only 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.510
 which is a smell and a flavor that to me 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 like we are going to take a trickle of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.620
 vanilla extract or around 5 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.190
 drops and this is going to give you a flavor and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.390
 Fabulous smell to our exfoliant 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.250
 finally the only thing left to do 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.370
 is 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.960
 put our ingredients together and start 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.050
 to mix it until it forms 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.430
 pill that is a bit sticky and that 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.950
 it is very compact 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.900
 now we're not going to use everything from a 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.000
 hit this can take us long enough 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.069
 days then what I'm going to do is that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.260
 I'm going to take my container as I 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.180
 I said before I had vick vaporub I'm going to 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.069
 take a little more alcohol and I'll 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.260
 disinfect to make sure I do not 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.760
 there is no microbe and also for 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.709
 make sure there's no waste 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.709
 of what I had before my container 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.150
 and finally I'm going to take my scrub and 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.260
 I'll put it in the container 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.549
 now remember this is an exfoliant 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.140
 totally organic then you have to 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.790
 clean the edges well and make sure 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.980
 that there is no waste left so that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.599
 Bugs and ants will not attack our 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.110
 exfoliant before we use it 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.030
 and now we have our exfoliant and 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.950
 now yes to take advantage of the scrub 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.720
 take it with your fingers and start 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.819
 massage your lips this is for 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.769
 remove pellets or dead cells 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.970
 that there are also residues of 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.970
 makeup and so on 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.990
 press the lips together and now with 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.420
 a slightly damp towel removes the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.980
 exfoliant uses the balm that 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.330
 you want this is just to make sure 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.500
 that is well moisturized and now if 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.570
 time to go crazy with the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.370
 lipsticks, nothing else is going to be 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.520
 labials stay longer but that 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.380
 the application is going to be very smooth and it's not going 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.570
 to have any kind of inequality 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.490
 on the skin you can use very colors 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.710
 strong and do not worry because the color 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.170
 come out or you can use lipsticks very 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.790
 claritos and you can also grab 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.250
 kisses to whoever you want because you're going to 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.360
 have the softest lips of the world 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.849
 best part is that you can take it 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.219
 with you wherever 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.800
 and well that 's all for me 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.330
 I send many soft kisses I hope that I 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.809
 have liked this video and until the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.809
