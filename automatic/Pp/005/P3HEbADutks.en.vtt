of the one of my favorite parts of

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.779 
of the one of my favorite parts of
Pathfinder<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.189> think<00:02:06.399> one<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.670> most

popular and that's its capability of

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.620 
popular and that's its capability of
creating<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.510> dual<00:02:10.780> pane<00:02:11.140> view<00:02:12.240> although<00:02:13.240> the

as<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.180> mentioned<00:03:46.570> each<00:03:46.720> window<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.110> completely

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
as I mentioned each window is completely

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.289 
as I mentioned each window is completely

so<00:03:52.360> you'll<00:03:52.450> see<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.630> have<00:03:52.989> Cover<00:03:53.230> Flow

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
cover flow in in both panes let's just

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.120 
cover flow in in both panes let's just
switch<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.720> off<00:04:10.959> took<00:04:11.560> over<00:04:11.829> here<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
switch that off took over here and

switch that off took over here and
switch<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:12.340> off<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.900> probably<00:04:14.200> out<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.320> all

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
switch that off so probably out of all

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.680 
switch that off so probably out of all

Pathfinder the dual pane option is

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.120 
Pathfinder the dual pane option is
probably<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.169> one<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.650> most<00:04:20.739> and

probably the one I like the most and
