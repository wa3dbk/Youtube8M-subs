00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
turtle beach's pretty much just a better

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so you can hear yourself the clarity is

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200 
so you can hear yourself the clarity is
a<00:00:45.510> lot<00:00:45.930> better<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.520> eliminates<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
a lot better and it just eliminates a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
a lot better and it just eliminates a
bit<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.750> background<00:00:49.020> noise<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.219> optic<00:00:50.520> loss

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
bit more background noise the optic loss

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
bit more background noise the optic loss
that<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.210> might<00:00:51.420> good<00:00:51.629> enough<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.050> gaming<00:00:52.469> but

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that it might good enough for gaming but

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
that it might good enough for gaming but
that's<00:00:53.250> pretty<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.520> about<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.420> pc

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that's pretty much about it if your pc

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
that's pretty much about it if your pc
is<00:00:55.050> really<00:00:55.379> lacking<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.100> especially<00:00:56.820> if
