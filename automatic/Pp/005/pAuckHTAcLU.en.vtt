00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
every time you paddle out into the ocean

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:20.570 
every time you paddle out into the ocean
teaches<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> lesson<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.240> some<00:00:12.450> way

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.220 

well<00:00:21.580> wood<00:00:21.760> is<00:00:21.910> just<00:00:22.150> there's<00:00:22.720> nothing<00:00:22.900> like

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
well wood is just there's nothing like

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
well wood is just there's nothing like
it<00:00:23.380> it's<00:00:23.530> a<00:00:23.620> biomimetic<00:00:24.100> material<00:00:24.880> so<00:00:25.090> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it it's a biomimetic material so the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.960 
it it's a biomimetic material so the
feeling<00:00:26.320> of<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.590> when<00:00:26.860> it's<00:00:27.010> gliding<00:00:27.580> on<00:00:27.940> a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
feeling of it when it's gliding on a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.240 
feeling of it when it's gliding on a
wave<00:00:28.210> I<00:00:28.540> believe<00:00:29.110> is<00:00:29.230> in<00:00:29.260> tune<00:00:29.619> with<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.070> way

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
wave I believe is in tune with the way

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.240 
wave I believe is in tune with the way
our<00:00:30.910> bodies<00:00:31.240> are<00:00:31.360> meant<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.739> feel<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:32.950> flex

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
our bodies are meant to feel that flex

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.010 
our bodies are meant to feel that flex
because<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:33.760> an<00:00:33.850> organic<00:00:34.239> material<00:00:34.390> I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
because it's an organic material I

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.350 
because it's an organic material I
always<00:00:35.890> did<00:00:36.100> it<00:00:36.129> I<00:00:36.280> always<00:00:36.670> made<00:00:36.879> my<00:00:37.030> own<00:00:37.059> board

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
always did it I always made my own board

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.790 
always did it I always made my own board
but<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:37.570> made<00:00:37.750> a<00:00:37.780> living<00:00:37.989> other<00:00:38.260> many<00:00:38.590> other

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
contractor's license and I was doing

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.570 
contractor's license and I was doing
environmentally<00:00:46.750> conscious<00:00:47.080> design

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
environmentally conscious design

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.920 
environmentally conscious design
remodels<00:00:48.580> and<00:00:48.760> building<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.449> at<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.810> same

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
remodels and building and at the same

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.360 
remodels and building and at the same
time<00:00:50.110> I<00:00:50.170> was<00:00:50.380> always<00:00:50.500> building<00:00:50.829> surfboards

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
time I was always building surfboards

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.819 
time I was always building surfboards
just<00:00:51.640> out<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:52.510> back<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.810> my<00:00:52.930> truck<00:00:53.200> or<00:00:53.470> in

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
just out of the back of my truck or in

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.569 
just out of the back of my truck or in
whatever<00:00:54.550> space<00:00:54.910> I<00:00:55.090> could<00:00:55.149> find<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.809> do<00:00:55.989> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
whatever space I could find to do it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.340 
whatever space I could find to do it
about<00:00:57.579> 12<00:00:58.180> years<00:00:58.270> ago<00:00:58.390> I'd<00:00:58.630> made<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.840> decision

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
about 12 years ago I'd made the decision

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.850 
about 12 years ago I'd made the decision
to<00:00:59.500> try<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.950> bring<00:01:00.280> my<00:01:00.970> desire<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:02.170> design

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
to try and bring my desire to design

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.320 
to try and bring my desire to design
things<00:01:03.070> more<00:01:03.309> sustainably<00:01:03.850> into<00:01:04.210> the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
things more sustainably into the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.440 
things more sustainably into the
surfboards<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.839> was<00:01:04.960> building<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:07.030> first<00:01:07.180> one

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
surfboards I was building the first one

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.510 
surfboards I was building the first one
took<00:01:08.140> me<00:01:08.320> probably<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.800> year<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.160> half<00:01:09.310> to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
took me probably a year and a half to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.760 
took me probably a year and a half to
build<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:10.060> from<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.810> beginning<00:01:11.140> stage<00:01:11.500> all

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
build just from the beginning stage all

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.040 
build just from the beginning stage all
the<00:01:11.800> way<00:01:11.950> through<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:13.630> did<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.869> in<00:01:13.960> my

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
the way through it I just did it in my

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.139 
the way through it I just did it in my
spare<00:01:14.470> time<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.950> at<00:01:15.340> night<00:01:15.610> late<00:01:15.880> at<00:01:16.030> night

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
spare time like at night late at night

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.960 
spare time like at night late at night
sneaking<00:01:16.360> out<00:01:16.600> in<00:01:16.660> my<00:01:16.869> garage<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.820> was<00:01:18.940> a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
sneaking out in my garage and it was a

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.330 
sneaking out in my garage and it was a
lot<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.240> trial<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:20.020> error<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.470> just<00:01:20.710> kind<00:01:21.310> of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
lot of trial and error and just kind of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.899 
lot of trial and error and just kind of
reinventing<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.060> wheel<00:01:22.180> as<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:22.630> went<00:01:22.780> along<00:01:22.900> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
reinventing the wheel as I went along a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.219 
reinventing the wheel as I went along a
lot<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.030> people's<00:01:25.270> work<00:01:25.330> it<00:01:25.750> was<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.990> crazy

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
lot of people's work it was the crazy

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.539 
lot of people's work it was the crazy
wood<00:01:26.470> board<00:01:26.710> guy<00:01:26.860> but<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.430> really

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
wood board guy but then it really

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.670 
wood board guy but then it really
started<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.150> grassroots<00:01:28.720> certain<00:01:29.080> level<00:01:29.500> where

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
started a grassroots certain level where

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.710 
started a grassroots certain level where
I'd<00:01:30.460> walk<00:01:30.700> down<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.000> street<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.450> somebody

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
I'd walk down the street and somebody

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.910 
I'd walk down the street and somebody
had<00:01:31.900> seen<00:01:32.020> me<00:01:32.170> with<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.380> board<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.799> would

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
had seen me with the board and I would

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.260 
had seen me with the board and I would
just<00:01:33.040> give<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.400> him<00:01:33.520> in<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.670> surfeit<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.240> I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
just give it to him in a surfeit and I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.260 
just give it to him in a surfeit and I
might<00:01:34.450> order<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:36.880> had<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> make<00:01:37.240> a

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
might order one and so I had to make a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.920 
might order one and so I had to make a
decision

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
decision

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260 
decision
do<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.799> jump<00:01:39.369> headfirst<00:01:39.580> into<00:01:39.970> building

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
do I jump headfirst into building

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.820 
do I jump headfirst into building
surfboards<00:01:40.689> for<00:01:40.750> other<00:01:40.960> thing<00:01:41.080> or<00:01:41.229> do<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.380> stick

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
surfboards for other thing or do I stick

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.050 
surfboards for other thing or do I stick
with<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.010> remodeling<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.580> just<00:01:42.760> keep<00:01:42.909> that

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
with the remodeling and just keep that
