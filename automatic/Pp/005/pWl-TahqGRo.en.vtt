00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 fitness freaks because have that many 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 industry and today we are engaged 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.410
 with the theme of difference one 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.179
 linear and a nonlinear 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 Prioritization of the possibilities 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.390
 We promise a lot of success 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.580
 can deal with both ways a lot 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 achieve success in things muscle building 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 and fat reduction in things increase power 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 we just have to think about who's doing what 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 he does the linear politicization and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 what does a true linear look like 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.759
 is prioritization and earn 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 maybe a non-linear one 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.210
 prioritizing the better alternative 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.270
 let's look at it in the form of one 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 diagram 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.700
 we have the possibility with one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 linear periodization of our trainings 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 intensity of our present 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.789
 starting point linearly upwards 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899
 climb 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 that means the farther we go on the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.430
 timeline to the right, the higher 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.769
 becomes my intensity 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.840
 so that could make a significant difference 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.979
 classical we take the hypertrophy 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 We start specific training here 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 with about 50 percent of our web 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.729
 edition change us an exercise for 15 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.880
 repeat 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 then we climb from week to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.159
 week so we at this point in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.549
 at about ten repetitions 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.710
 are in about 75 percent of ours 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.689
 maximum court and at the end of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 cycle we are at five repetitions 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.430
 with 90 percent of our Rewe-Nazi 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.360
 change us an exercise 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.920
 that would be a very classic linear 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.799
 Prioritization means we increase 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.710
 from week to week from micro cycle to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.829
 micro cycle continues ours 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.860
 Training weight and reduce for it 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.450
 the repetition that is ours 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.520
 intensity rises 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 sports scientific view seen 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.780
 intensity means the use of the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 percentage range of the Soviet 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.450
 vecsey must be at a non-linear 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.880
 Prioritization could be the whole thing 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.970
 otherwise, that's what we mean 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.770
 start one with one in week 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.950
 moderate load in week 2 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:41.510
 we train with a very high load 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.489
 in week 3 with light load and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 then start again from the beginning 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.959
 that means we could say for example 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.489
 We train here in the first week 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:56.090
 in the classic hypertrophy area with 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.400
 eight to twelve repetitions and 70 to 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.220
 80 percent of the monolithic maximums 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.320
 go to one in the second week 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.230
 typical force plan about that is with 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.920
 354 apartment and 90 to 95 percent of 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.890
 British maximums and in week three 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.769
 Let's go to strength endurance 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.170
 that is, possibly 20 to 25 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.080
 repetitions per sentence and maybe 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.350
 also only 40 to 60 percent of 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.690
 british girl after this first 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.620
 training blog we start the whole 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.230
 again from the beginning 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.200
 however, we are now going through a comparison 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.390
 the first week in hypertrophy area 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.670
 a little higher in the power range 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.830
 also a little higher than in the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.440
 compared to the first block and also in 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.940
 power endurance range here a small 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.780
 little higher that means we have here 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.480
 again our hypertrophy area 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.660
 our maximum power range our 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.810
 Endurance in the third block is possible 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.010
 then a little higher than in the block 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.750
 previously in the professional area the same in the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.230
 maximalkraft area and the same 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.739
 also in force endurance range over 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.870
 trophy max 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.669
 to have endurance and underline 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.650
 We give the different zones 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.290
 that means over professional 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.229
 I do that with an extra color 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.840
 hypertrophy area a progressive 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.210
 load increase in maximum power 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.060
 area a progressive load 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.030
 increase and endurance range 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.500
 a maximalkraft or a progressive one 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.290
 burden increase 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.510
 that means we have in at the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.490
 nonlinear precisions individual 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.190
 small short workout blogs like 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.830
 For example, one week each 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.750
 within three of these blogs one 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.590
 progressive load increase in all 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.310
 the individual areas built or 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.410
 We have a simple linear weight 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.810
 always worked up and up 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.060
 have in strength endurance area 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.300
 started over the classic 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.340
 hypertrophy area in the maximalkraft 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.650
 area changed and had 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.520
 according to here longer trainings 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.460
 blocks per area for beginners 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.010
 the linear approach works very well 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.080
 in scientific studies became 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.680
 shown that in advanced 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.320
 drop the nonlinear area out of them 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.370
 not ten years of realization 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.220
 tends to be in power development 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.950
 a little bit better and works 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.020
 accordingly also the non-linear 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.000
 Prioritization for weightlifters and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.330
 experienced bodybuilders are recommended 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.580
 can 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.630
 Much success in the implementation and we 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.630
 see us in the next video
