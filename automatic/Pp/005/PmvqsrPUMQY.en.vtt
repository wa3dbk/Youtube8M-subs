00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.220
 one of the least-used elements in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.060
 account when developing our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.680
 ability to improvise tiba is the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.010
 rhythmic component of our lines 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 melodic our musical system 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.470
 has evolved harmonic and melodic 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.390
 mind long enough for the 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.600
 the most important challenge is the movement 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.519
 rhythmic 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.559
 in our improvisation what do you want 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.390
 say this we have advanced so much 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.309
 melodically and harmonically as it came 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.409
 design that we started we are already 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.879
 practically tolerating 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.000
 any tension practically 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.159
 any dissonance if we do not put a 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 little strict if we review our 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.860
 harmony materials we will see that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.770
 for any chord of our system 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.880
 of 12 sounds safely I can 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.970
 touch 9 in some cases 10 then there's 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 much more likely that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.900
 Progress 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.880
 is going through the application 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.490
 rhythm and rhythmic complexity 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 that through the election of notes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.180
 because as we see saying we are 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.940
 tolerating virtually any 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 tensions over our chords what 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's see in this election is a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.259
 approach with which we can 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 start giving rhythmic value to our 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.860
 to our phrases another component 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.240
 important is the extension of the phrase 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.740
 usually we play on 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 phrases 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 too short about everything 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.760
 we come from the school blues rockera 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.300
 we tend to make phrases 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.300
 d 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.960
 of that duration 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.610
 and when we try to do the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.040
 transition to the sound of 12 Zionists or to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.530
 playing worked to play jazz we give ourselves 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.580
 note that guitarists have other 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.580
 much longer sentences 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.640
 and we feel like the sentences if 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.830
 we come from blues or rock 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 we have like the phrases fall off 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.610
 before time like we can not 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.440
 get in the exercises that we're going to 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.570
 develop now aims at 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.880
 also give you rhythmic value on the one hand 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.070
 and on the other hand allow us all 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.200
 phrases much longer the element 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.300
 that we are going to use to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.270
 develop our technical capacity is 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.240
 a rhythmic template 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.460
 the term that came to him personally 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.920
 which is the term that seems to me most 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.110
 successful is 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.560
 find what is our subdivision 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.310
 smaller rhythm that allows us 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.810
 play fluidly and consistently 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.810
 I have a rhythm 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.010
 time is this the pulse is this 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.530
 find a division 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.319
 in equivalent notes that allow me 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.760
 divide that time if I can touch or if 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.510
 my technique is only to play 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.510
 eighth notes is going to be 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.030
 Total will try to touch that micro 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.599
 blind that binary is a division in 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.599
 groups of 2 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.099
 so that means that all my 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.379
 notes are going to fall into one of those 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.269
 rhythmic strokes means that I'm going to 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.280
 touch all patients with not the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.530
 technical complexity I will give it to the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.079
 incorporation of silences in the middle 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.930
 of the marks of this template well 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.959
 let say 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.359
 we are going to do in this election so much 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.489
 rhythmic templates on sixteenths 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.890
 in binary form we are not going to point to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.500
 touch in graves but let's go to 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.940
 try to touch maximum 11 micros and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.010
 let's try to play in three places 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.680
 to be able to touch in templates 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.620
 canaries that are the divisions in three 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.209
 or multiples of 3 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.310
 I'm afraid they would be 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.380
 the soul that would be the blues that would be 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.540
 play the swing that would be 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.760
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.950
 trying to respect the accents and 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.890
 respect 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.890
 and the fluidity of the rhythmic figure
