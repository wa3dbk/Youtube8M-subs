order<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.910> save<00:01:13.300> humanity<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.320> kind

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
order to save humanity so this is kind

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.650 
order to save humanity so this is kind
of<00:01:14.590> interesting<00:01:14.740> twist<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.820> we<00:01:16.000> were<00:01:16.390> having

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
of interesting twist that we were having

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.480 
of interesting twist that we were having
fun<00:01:16.690> with

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.130 

the<00:01:21.490> idea<00:01:21.760> is<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.479> as<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:22.780> move<00:01:22.810> through

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
the idea is is that as you move through

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.320 
the idea is is that as you move through
the<00:01:23.409> game<00:01:23.590> instead<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> managing<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:25.060> lot<00:01:25.210> of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
the game instead of managing a lot of

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.000 
the game instead of managing a lot of
inventory<00:01:25.630> like<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.320> would<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> traditional

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
inventory like you would a traditional

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.980 
inventory like you would a traditional
action<00:01:27.310> RPG<00:01:27.670> you<00:01:28.000> find<00:01:28.210> parts<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
action RPG you find parts and with the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.830 
action RPG you find parts and with the
parts<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.070> make<00:01:30.280> things<00:01:30.490> okay<00:01:31.300> get<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.690> make

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
parts it to make things okay get to make

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.020 
parts it to make things okay get to make
grenades<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.590> mines<00:01:32.890> things<00:01:33.430> like<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.790> and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
grenades and mines things like that and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.270 
grenades and mines things like that and
you<00:01:34.210> can<00:01:34.390> create<00:01:34.660> your<00:01:34.900> upgrades<00:01:35.530> from<00:01:36.040> your

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you can create your upgrades from your

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.300 
you can create your upgrades from your
parts<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:37.300> this<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:38.050> lot<00:01:38.320> more<00:01:38.500> streamlined

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
parts so this is a lot more streamlined

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.969 
parts so this is a lot more streamlined
so<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.180> things<00:01:40.420> move<00:01:40.659> quicker<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.830> get

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
so that things move quicker and you get

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.070 
so that things move quicker and you get
to<00:01:42.070> go<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.220> these<00:01:42.430> these<00:01:43.000> benches<00:01:43.659> he's<00:01:43.869> work

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080

to go to these these benches he's work
benches<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:44.680> that's<00:01:44.860> where<00:01:45.070> we're<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.640> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
benches so that's where we're going and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.100
