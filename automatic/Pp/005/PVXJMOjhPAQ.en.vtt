00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
in the sky with what's here on the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.860 
in the sky with what's here on the
started<00:00:11.010> planet<00:00:11.280> locator<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.599> can

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
started planet locator and how you can

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.620 
started planet locator and how you can
use<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.830> identify<00:00:14.000> constellations<00:00:15.000> so

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
use this to identify constellations so

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
use this to identify constellations so
let's<00:00:15.960> set<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:16.830> date<00:00:17.190> let's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
let's set it to a different date let's

is<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> north<00:01:59.759> side

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
is you would want to take the north side

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.469 
is you would want to take the north side
of<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.170> starting<00:02:01.860> planet<00:02:02.159> locator<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.790> turn

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
of the starting planet locator and turn

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
of the starting planet locator and turn
that<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:06.110> at<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.380> bottom<00:02:07.849> hold<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that so it was at the bottom hold that

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.750 
that so it was at the bottom hold that
north<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.020> hand<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
north side in your hand and then the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880 
north side in your hand and then the
edge<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> opening<00:02:12.780> he

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
edge of the opening he

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.250 
edge of the opening he
corresponds<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.250> northern<00:02:15.700> horizon

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
corresponds to the northern horizon

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.839 
corresponds to the northern horizon
rightfully<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.709> if<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.920> return<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.400> face<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
rightfully so if you return to face the

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.690 
rightfully so if you return to face the
northern<00:02:19.319> turn<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.409> face<00:02:20.590> due<00:02:20.830> north<00:02:21.040> then

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
northern turn to face due north then

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.820 
northern turn to face due north then
this<00:02:21.940> would<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.870> horizon<00:02:23.409> right<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.680> front

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
this would be the horizon right in front

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
this would be the horizon right in front
of<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.250> just<00:02:24.340> over<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.819> horizon<00:02:24.970> you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
of you and just over the horizon you

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.059 
of you and just over the horizon you
would<00:02:25.510> see<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> Big<00:02:26.110> Dipper<00:02:26.140> or<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
would see the Big Dipper or the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.309 
would see the Big Dipper or the
constellation<00:02:27.730> Ursa<00:02:27.940> Major<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.720> little<00:02:29.230> bit

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
constellation Ursa Major a little bit

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.869 
constellation Ursa Major a little bit
above<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.650> would<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.159> the<00:02:30.310> North<00:02:30.489> celestial

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
above that would be the North celestial

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.050 
above that would be the North celestial
Pole<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.540> almost<00:02:32.409> straight<00:02:32.860> overhead<00:02:33.129> most

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
Pole and almost straight overhead most

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.539 
Pole and almost straight overhead most
of<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.299> way<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.599> would<00:02:34.870> be<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.200> M<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.769> W<00:02:35.799> shaped

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
of the way up would be the M or W shaped

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.479 
of the way up would be the M or W shaped
constellation<00:02:37.360> Cassiopeia<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.860> straight<00:02:39.340> on

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
constellation Cassiopeia so straight on

the<00:02:39.579> northern<00:02:39.909> horizon<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:41.019> Big<00:02:41.200> Dipper<00:02:41.379> then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the northern horizon the Big Dipper then

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.520 
the northern horizon the Big Dipper then
up<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.310> Polaris<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.510> Little<00:02:44.019> Dipper<00:02:44.049> and

up to Polaris and the Little Dipper and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.789 
up to Polaris and the Little Dipper and
then<00:02:44.650> Cassiopeia<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.170> were<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.379> look<00:02:47.560> east

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
then Cassiopeia if you were to look east

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.970 
then Cassiopeia if you were to look east
or<00:02:48.190> west<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:49.120> slightly<00:02:49.629> different<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.500> you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
or west it's a slightly different if you

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.130 
or west it's a slightly different if you
look<00:02:51.190> there's<00:02:51.549> two<00:02:51.819> small<00:02:52.000> letters<00:02:52.569> over<00:02:52.870> to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
look there's two small letters over to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.640 
look there's two small letters over to
the<00:02:53.260> side<00:02:53.500> right<00:02:53.769> here<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.190> small<00:02:54.549> W<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
the side right here is a small W and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.199 
the side right here is a small W and
over<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.099> right<00:02:57.400> side<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.940> we're<00:02:58.120> looking

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
over on the right side as we're looking

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.530 
over on the right side as we're looking
at<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.510> there's<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.870> small<00:02:59.260> e<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.299> those

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
at it there's a small e right at those

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.399 
at it there's a small e right at those
letters<00:03:02.370> corresponds<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> do<00:03:03.849> east<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.540> do

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
letters corresponds to do east and do

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.280 
letters corresponds to do east and do
West<00:03:05.829> on<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.310> horizon<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.510> if<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.720> turn<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.109> face

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
West on the horizon so if I turn to face

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.490 
West on the horizon so if I turn to face
due<00:03:08.739> west<00:03:09.040> then<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.730> would<00:03:09.909> want<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:10.150> W<00:03:10.810> at<00:03:11.230> the

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
due west then I would want that W at the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.080 
due west then I would want that W at the
bottom<00:03:11.859> like<00:03:12.609> that<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.120> then<00:03:14.049> right<00:03:14.650> there

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
bottom like that and then right there

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.780 
bottom like that and then right there
with<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.299> due<00:03:17.049> west<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:17.590> my<00:03:17.739> horizon<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.459> I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
with the due west of my horizon and I

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.830 
with the due west of my horizon and I
would<00:03:18.940> see<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.239> stars<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.810> constellation

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
would see the stars of the constellation

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.559 
would see the stars of the constellation
Aquila<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.700> would<00:03:21.849> be<00:03:21.970> sitting<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.450> the

Aquila as it would be sitting in the
West<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.079> then<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> little<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.590> above<00:03:23.889> that

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
West and then a little bit above that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.710 
West and then a little bit above that
Cygnus<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.470> Delphinus<00:03:27.419> likewise<00:03:28.419> if<00:03:28.599> I

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
Cygnus and Delphinus likewise if I

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.839 
Cygnus and Delphinus likewise if I
wanted<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.079> face<00:03:29.260> east<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.950> see<00:03:30.400> what<00:03:30.579> was<00:03:30.700> in

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
wanted to face east and see what was in

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.960 
wanted to face east and see what was in
the<00:03:30.940> eastern<00:03:31.299> sky<00:03:31.419> that<00:03:32.349> would<00:03:32.500> take<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.950> leap

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
the eastern sky that would take the leap

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.330 
the eastern sky that would take the leap
little<00:03:34.329> e<00:03:34.540> put<00:03:35.139> it<00:03:35.260> right<00:03:35.410> there<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.919> the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
bottom and there's my eastern horizon

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.369 
bottom and there's my eastern horizon
with<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.950> stars<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.400> Orion<00:03:39.849> coming<00:03:40.150> up<00:03:40.379> and

with the stars of Orion coming up and

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.110 
with the stars of Orion coming up and
you<00:03:41.560> could<00:03:41.709> do<00:03:41.829> in<00:03:42.069> between<00:03:42.220> directions<00:03:43.000> like

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
you could do in between directions like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.390 
you could do in between directions like
if<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:43.389> wanted<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.690> face<00:03:43.870> north<00:03:44.199> east<00:03:44.470> then

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
if you wanted to face north east then

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.470 
if you wanted to face north east then
here's<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.060> east

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
here's do you east

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.270 
here's do you east
here's<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.900> north<00:03:47.139> so<00:03:47.470> right<00:03:47.829> around<00:03:48.040> there's

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
here's to north so right around there's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.520 
here's to north so right around there's
the<00:03:48.430> northeastern<00:03:49.030> part<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.480> sky<00:03:49.720> right

the northeastern part of the sky right

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.170 
the northeastern part of the sky right
there<00:03:50.709> I'd<00:03:50.799> see<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.099> stars<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.549> Gemini<00:03:51.819> on<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
there I'd see the stars of Gemini on the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.439 
there I'd see the stars of Gemini on the
Northeast<00:03:52.629> with<00:03:53.230> Auriga<00:03:53.680> above<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.389> if<00:03:55.389> I

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
Northeast with Auriga above that if I

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.030 
Northeast with Auriga above that if I
wanted<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.810> look<00:03:55.930> straight<00:03:56.260> overhead<00:03:56.769> again

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
wanted to look straight overhead again

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.369 
wanted to look straight overhead again
that<00:03:57.519> would<00:03:57.669> be<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.269> center<00:03:59.049> of<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.290> opening

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
that would be the center of the opening

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.780 
that would be the center of the opening
would<00:03:59.650> be<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.889> part<00:04:00.129> of<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.220> sky<00:04:00.459> straight

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
would be the part of the sky straight

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.150 
would be the part of the sky straight
overhead
