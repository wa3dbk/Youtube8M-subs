00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello welcome to the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.680
 headquarters of the crowds is here 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 My office here I plan what I like 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.679
 Farmer 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
 I have the soloists where I have my garden 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 as recorded as plan and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 consider what I wanted to order 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.150
 Today I have to think about the topic 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 melon if I join in the mini 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 challenge texts youtuber melons 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 challenge youtuber that's what it's gonna be 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.149
 give many different channels and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 Everyone will choose a melon 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.629
 and the zig and chris jingling 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.110
 few seeds that bring my cat like 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110
 quiet before 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.170
 comes and sits down the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 most important papers 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.210
 Anyway, everyone will be 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.790
 So youtuber breed a melon and it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 Everyone is free water because wild and 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.440
 I want to explain briefly what I am 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 have decided and why there is in the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.970
 heaps of melons that have the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.890
 different art names this 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.080
 Some of the world, for example, is the bread 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 from Jerusalem 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 That's a tune up to 30 kilos 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 big and so huge that you can get that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320
 can not imagine at all then 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.560
 again, there is a suite that means 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.580
 time like us or one of the dinners sugar 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.119
 baby and it is not so easy 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.310
 to put on melons because you like that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.380
 one without having gerber and I think 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 even then wet and my button is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.979
 tend to be rather warm and mostly 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 wet but sometimes dry too 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.330
 minutes are difficult to grow i have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.090
 I still decided for one 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.539
 namely for the watermelons golden 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 gold with means in the network and the 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.500
 was not quite sympathetic 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.149
 besides, the golden middle still has one 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.580
 few other features have one 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.730
 beautiful salmon pink pulp 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.239
 and outside I know how to go 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.060
 can 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.310
 she has a yellow peel and is 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 probably only jumping not only linguistically 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.650
 green that means when the tires will be 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.900
 the yellow and then you can see 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.770
 that the red is and I think so 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.349
 Pretty cool 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.440
 besides, it has a short cultural life 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.950
 of only 70 days and I hope 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 that I hold it 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.080
 make it in my short cold summer 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.879
 is now mid april that is to say 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.769
 Highest time for the seeds in the earth 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.690
 get 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.060
 because I do not answer anymore 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.830
 I have to make my own ones 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 and juices that time I know that is 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.810
 a cool tip as oneself to be 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 you can not make carpets 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.819
 a lot of it just a bit 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.549
 old paper and a small bottle though 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.549
 It is simply called newsprint 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:23.860
 an incitement and then you take the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.040
 bottle develops the paper 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.489
 why else neat and as taut as 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.489
 it works 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.269
 you stuff the newspaper on one 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.269
 neat side together 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.830
 and a few times with the bottle 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.150
 neatly press that that is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:04:00.959
 determined not if you have one takes yet 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.900
 a paperclip and the other you 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:08.459
 and puts the edge with the paperclip 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.159
 good together that keeps it neat 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.980
 then you see the bottle out and 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:20.289
 hold the planter I have 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:27.789
 prepared here and yes then 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:36.690
 fear it still with earth and then can 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:39.400
 get started and melon millimeter melon 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.720
 so now I have like the colleagues 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.979
 actually look like 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:52.139
 that is not yet inspected 1 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.139
 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.960
 They look like watermelon kernels 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.150
 maybe a bit tan than done 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.200
 I made the commercial pink 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.480
 watermelons so know at least one 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.110
 centimeters deep, they should be implanted 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.770
 become 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.290
 look at them with earth in mind a 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.730
 centimeters of snow is now here each 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.950
 in a bit pure 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.510
 well I forgot that I forgot you 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.790
 to say one can also just such a 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:39.750
 Tissue paper roll take the suitable ones 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:42.150
 also quite red, well, then I think 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.840
 just a little bit of earth 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.840
 centimeter 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:01.280
 well, at least water planned 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.419
 i like that atomizer number that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.520
 I like the most beautiful view at the short 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:24.530
 if you have to cough a bit 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.610
 your day and there you feel like petrus 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.830
 Personally you just can not 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:36.750
 to forget 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:40.490
 unfortunately forgotten as usual watered 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:44.099
 now they come to the windowsill like that 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.719
 that he is my little indoor grower 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.870
 garden is a converted one 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.699
 desk under the pitch i 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.800
 Hope the millions get here 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.620
 a lot of sun and I hope it is 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.860
 warm enough now that they are neat 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.229
 can start unsightly with 1 euro type 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.229
 ju updated game
