00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 Y 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:20.449
 after this we had another meeting very 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.029
 important that I had several pending 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.520
 months that for one is part of the work 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.490
 daily 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.870
 and for those who went to meeting was 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.280
 something historic to the point that but 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.770
 a plate I do not know if they removed the plate 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.239
 me being friend the recognition plate 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.220
 and all that I think is not complete 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.620
 his work did not but I did realize that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.840
 while for what was for me 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.430
 part of my daily work for 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.420
 get to something historic because 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.850
 first time in history a president the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.470
 republic met with representatives 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.970
 of the groups that betis do not know if what 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.230
 It has the complete order 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.090
 glv glp yes I think the betis is saying 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.730
 gay lesbian bisexual transsexual 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.690
 intersex 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.750
 remember that our constitution 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 guarantees equal rights 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.830
 prohibits all kinds of discrimination by 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.550
 race or religion by preferences 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.440
 sexual and so on these groups have 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.940
 rights and those rights are 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.790
 formalized in the law in the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 constitution but in practice still 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.080
 they face serious problems of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 discrimination at the labor level 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.470
 educational 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.380
 in schools many health level 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.100
 Sometimes they are not taken care of etc. and not 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.920
 we will allow that kind of discrimination 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.800
 so I met with representative of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.509
 LGBT groups and over here I have some 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.479
 conclusions for example there are close are 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.920
 very susceptible to receiving aggressions 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.619
 the groups of minor and especially the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 transsexuals there are about 15 murders 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.259
 not resolved but the commitments were 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.539
 a government commission to give 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.540
 follow up on those cases and that they are not left 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.700
 in impunity 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.820
 also to the commitments the promotion 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.520
 media rights there are times that 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.010
 do not understand people already formally this 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.890
 is established in the zero constitution 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.660
 discrimination but there are times when 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 public officials professors 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.370
 public and so on do not know or do not know 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.010
 they understand this and there is still discrimination 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 you can not expel anyone from a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.520
 school for belonging to groups by 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.230
 example the betis 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.909
 and this is happening 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 we committed to forming the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.940
 public servants because many times 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.890
 they do not have training to attend 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.510
 adequately to these groups to 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.090
 establish procedures 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.890
 public institutions for example 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.670
 you know that I put myself at 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.769
 equal marriage not the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 constitution defines marriage as the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.569
 union between man and woman there are groups lp 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 and who seek that equal marriage 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.870
 I do not understand things more urgent 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 example the aggressions to those of l vete and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 why 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.960
 probably for this an emblem of 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.180
 equal marriage but already with the 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.830
 de facto union recognized in the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.690
 constitution have all the rights 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.660
 that you could have a marriage if you 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.210
 important to the state that contract 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.580
 civil is union of that union between man 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.010
 and woman the figure of marriage Mason the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.140
 religious marriage does not face him 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.030
 state does not grant them any right 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.270
 additional these groups with whom I 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.400
 gathered they had perfectly clear 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.670
 there is right union for what it means 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.000
 if a gay couple register their union 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.880
 in fact and one of them dies the couple 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.890
 can inherit those others or be one of 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.860
 the many rights that the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.730
 notarized formalization of the union of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.180
 done but also he 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.069
 the person who works can for example 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.430
 affiliate to social security to your 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.019
 fellow mate and that peace still 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.819
 public institutions are not 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.190
 prepared for that he told me in the 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.859
 case of a gay couple with union of 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.320
 notarized that he was affiliated with his 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.199
 couple to the social security but as they were 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.419
 two men the system did not accept the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.419
 case and that unconstitutional because the 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.070
 constitution recognizes the de facto union 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.229
 yes we have had a meeting I think very 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.180
 productive with representatives of groups 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:39.190
 on etb l 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.419
 glp and our commitment to work for 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.940
 better server training 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.520
 public and procedural 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.949
 public institutions to attend to 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.380
 rights of these groups for me a 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.000
 meeting more than working for them to 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.430
 them something historic to the point that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.650
 they gave me a recognition plaque 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.410
 you years and enemies the plates 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.000
 medals acknowledgments but what 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.460
 accepted with great humility and is more 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.780
 I hope I deserve, I'm going to work for 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.370
 try to deserve it because I think not 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.169
 I deserve it, I think it costs us a lot 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.630
 to guarantee the rights to 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.220
 sexual minorities and a personal one for 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.419
 overcome prejudices atavism some 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.300
 Sometimes they let go of me too 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.690
 expressions perhaps of stereotypes that 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.930
 we have had and that are difficult to overcome 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.690
 but you have to overcome them, not why 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.280
 we all have the right, I see a lot 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.620
 Hope for young people to young people 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.620
 they have a very different mindset 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.520
 which we with whom we 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.560
 we grew up that are very tolerant very 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.960
 respectful of these groups and in good 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.910
 hour but there is a lot to do already 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.090
 things are done at the legal level to 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.400
 formal level is missing run these 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.770
 rights at a real level and above all that 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.350
 cultural change that we must have all 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.530
 Ecuadorians and Ecuadorians in this 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.530
 appearance
