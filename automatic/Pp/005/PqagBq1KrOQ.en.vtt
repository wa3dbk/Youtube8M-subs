Toby<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:01.920> chocolate<00:01:02.370> maker<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.300> could

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
Toby our chocolate maker as you could

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.960 
Toby our chocolate maker as you could
see<00:01:03.690> he's<00:01:04.290> sorting<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> raw<00:01:04.920> beans<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
see he's sorting the raw beans the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
see he's sorting the raw beans the
reason<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.049> when<00:01:07.200> harvested

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
reason we do this is that when harvested

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
reason we do this is that when harvested
the<00:01:08.189> cocoa<00:01:08.490> beans<00:01:08.700> tend<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> pick<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.330> sticks

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the cocoa beans tend to pick up sticks

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.750 
the cocoa beans tend to pick up sticks
stones<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> other<00:01:10.409> debris

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.149 

now<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.820> roaster<00:01:17.509> holds<00:01:17.930> about<00:01:18.080> 30<00:01:18.470> pounds<00:01:19.070> of

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
now the roaster holds about 30 pounds of

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.649 
now the roaster holds about 30 pounds of
raw<00:01:19.340> beans<00:01:20.979> will<00:01:21.979> set<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.430> roaster<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.970> 300

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
raw beans will set the roaster to 300

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.109 
raw beans will set the roaster to 300
degrees<00:01:23.930> Fahrenheit<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.009> will<00:01:25.400> roast<00:01:25.700> until

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
degrees Fahrenheit and will roast until

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.810 
degrees Fahrenheit and will roast until
the<00:01:26.360> bean<00:01:26.570> temperature<00:01:27.020> hits<00:01:27.430> 223<00:01:28.430> degrees

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
the bean temperature hits 223 degrees

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.179 
the bean temperature hits 223 degrees
towards<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.869> end<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> roast<00:01:30.439> will<00:01:30.920> sample

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
towards the end of the roast will sample

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:44.440 
towards the end of the roast will sample
the<00:01:31.340> beans<00:01:31.840> let's<00:01:32.840> start<00:01:33.080> roasting<00:01:43.119> now<00:01:44.119> here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the beans let's start roasting now here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.180 
the beans let's start roasting now here
we<00:01:44.570> are<00:01:44.600> sampling<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.440> beans<00:01:45.649> near<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.039> end

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
we are sampling the beans near the end

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.210 
we are sampling the beans near the end
of<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> roast<00:01:48.880> hmm<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:53.390> about<00:01:53.690> ready

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
of the roast hmm just about ready

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.180 
of the roast hmm just about ready
well<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.369> 2:23<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.509> think<00:01:56.780> they're<00:01:56.960> ready

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
well it's 2:23 and I think they're ready

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.609 
well it's 2:23 and I think they're ready
when<00:01:58.190> our<00:01:58.340> beans<00:01:58.580> are<00:01:58.819> roasted<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.509> perfection

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
when our beans are roasted to perfection

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.109 
when our beans are roasted to perfection
we<00:02:00.619> unload<00:02:00.979> them<00:02:01.159> into<00:02:01.369> our<00:02:01.460> special<00:02:01.700> cart

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
we unload them into our special cart

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.540 
we unload them into our special cart
here<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:03.020> let<00:02:03.200> them<00:02:03.380> get<00:02:03.619> right<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.250> cool

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.270 

we<00:02:10.060> use<00:02:10.210> an<00:02:10.390> air<00:02:10.600> blower<00:02:10.930> but<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.130> use<00:02:12.250> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
we use an air blower but you can use a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.860 
we use an air blower but you can use a
pedestal<00:02:12.670> fan<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.150> blow<00:02:13.330> air<00:02:13.540> across<00:02:13.750> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
pedestal fan to blow air across the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.430 
pedestal fan to blow air across the
beans

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.680 

the<00:02:18.040> next<00:02:18.340> step<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.850> winnow<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> roasted

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
the next step is to winnow the roasted

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.050 
the next step is to winnow the roasted
beans<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.650> winner<00:02:20.890> would<00:02:21.010> gently<00:02:21.490> breaks<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
beans the winner would gently breaks the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.110 
beans the winner would gently breaks the
shells<00:02:22.330> those<00:02:22.600> who<00:02:22.810> remove<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.650> nib

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
shells those who remove it from the nib

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:39.539 
shells those who remove it from the nib
okay<00:02:25.120> Toby

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.160 

now<00:02:40.549> this<00:02:40.849> is<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> most<00:02:41.329> important

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
now this is the most important

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.920 
now this is the most important
ingredient<00:02:42.859> in<00:02:42.980> making<00:02:43.280> chocolate<00:02:46.930> finished

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
ingredient in making chocolate finished

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.349 
ingredient in making chocolate finished
chocolate<00:02:48.560> consists<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.430> finely<00:02:50.090> ground

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
chocolate consists of finely ground

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.270 
chocolate consists of finely ground
particles<00:02:51.109> which<00:02:51.319> give<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.829> smooth

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
particles which give it a smooth

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.789 
particles which give it a smooth
mouthfeel<00:02:53.180> now<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.719> requires<00:02:53.900> refining

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
mouthfeel now this requires refining

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.009 
mouthfeel now this requires refining
them<00:02:54.920> down<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.340> less<00:02:55.549> than<00:02:55.849> 30<00:02:56.150> microns<00:02:56.810> in

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
them down to less than 30 microns in

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.589 
them down to less than 30 microns in
size<00:02:57.430> Toby<00:02:58.430> had<00:02:58.579> just<00:02:58.879> passed<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.389> nib

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
size Toby had just passed the nib

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.690
