00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in there along with him I almost blew

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.730 
in there along with him I almost blew
the<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.090> Donald<00:00:21.510> because<00:00:22.289> instead<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> me

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the game Donald because instead of me

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.009 
the game Donald because instead of me
trying<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.039> score<00:00:23.279> over<00:00:23.670> font<00:00:23.970> zone<00:00:24.240> seeing

trying to score over font zone seeing

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.960 
trying to score over font zone seeing
him<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.619> Charlie<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.220> angered<00:00:26.640> me<00:00:26.789> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
him get to Charlie just angered me so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
him get to Charlie just angered me so
that<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> think<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> man<00:00:28.199> took<00:00:28.380> enough<00:00:28.680> tonight

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
that I think the man took enough tonight

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
that I think the man took enough tonight
and<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.670> almost<00:00:29.939> blew<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> game<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> know

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and I almost blew the game you know

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
and I almost blew the game you know
myself<00:00:30.779> by<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.260> hitting<00:00:31.410> him<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.859> should<00:00:32.279> have

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
myself by just hitting him I should have

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.830 
myself by just hitting him I should have
just<00:00:32.669> went<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.090> tried<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> score<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
just went on and tried to score but I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
just went on and tried to score but I
was<00:00:34.020> more<00:00:34.230> interested<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.770> was

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
was more interested in what was

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.260 
was more interested in what was
happening<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.340> Charlie<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
happening to Charlie well I think it's a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.310 
happening to Charlie well I think it's a
good<00:00:36.390> thing<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.750> did<00:00:36.930> Tony<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
good thing that you did Tony it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.569 
good thing that you did Tony it
certainly<00:00:37.530> took<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> pressure<00:00:38.190> off<00:00:38.280> him

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
certainly took a lot of pressure off him

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
certainly took a lot of pressure off him
he<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.790> him<00:00:39.000> away<00:00:39.120> from<00:00:40.070> staying<00:00:41.070> with

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
he got him away from staying with

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
he got him away from staying with
O'Connell<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> seemed<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.360> combination

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
O'Connell it seemed to be a combination

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
O'Connell it seemed to be a combination
as<00:00:43.320> chief<00:00:43.559> team<00:00:43.770> they've<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.280> great<00:00:44.489> jammers

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
as chief team they've got great jammers

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.970 
as chief team they've got great jammers
why<00:00:45.149> why<00:00:45.420> they're<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> such<00:00:46.590> heavy

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
why why they're going to such heavy

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
why why they're going to such heavy
tactics<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.760> don't<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.210> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
tactics I really don't know but it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.459 
tactics I really don't know but it
certainly<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.840> got<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> bad

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
certainly has got to put you in a bad

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
certainly has got to put you in a bad
position<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.449> saw
