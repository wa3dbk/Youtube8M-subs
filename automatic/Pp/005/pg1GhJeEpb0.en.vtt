00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it's and then there's the carbon

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.730 
it's and then there's the carbon
footprint<00:01:25.679> that<00:01:26.250> goes<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:27.439> that's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> lot

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
footprint that goes with it that's a lot

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.990
