00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.720
 Halli hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.009
 new player like us today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960
 player probably not so 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.950
 many of you have on the screen or 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.259
 had or generally only from a team 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.410
 before a two weeks and that the in of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.390
 Salvador accra 32 places advised fourth 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.359
 four represent sgs high middle age 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.010
 right foot 166 tall eight goals and three 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 Templates in ten do not play 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.980
 56,000 coins b92 tempo 70 shot 68 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 fit and we look at the slipway 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.969
 games while I'm always down to cabbage 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 A lot of money costs four places ski 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.309
 then his ingame stats are natural 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.420
 some neat doing 95 p 3 to 2 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:53.100
 Control 85 free kick accurate and 85 94 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 firepower 67 long protection so that's it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.129
 first so the deepest cp shooting power 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 are really what makes him so 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.769
 we'll see how others like that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.659
 maybe agility 95 balance 7 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 attraktionen 200 speak 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.640
 incredibly fast player and great 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 if you are very horny thing on everyone 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.549
 case that its all first big 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.020
 plus 35 of course do not strengthen that way 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.909
 For a long time, be aware of it 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.590
 dribbling like here in 14 clubs see the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.530
 maybe best example 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 we have one with no problems at all 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.049
 then would be placed in the penalty area eleven meters 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.030
 get out that's really something 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.360
 enter 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.799
 that's a big plus adapt 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.780
 as you can see in this area have now 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.880
 Also neat what you think of silver 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.579
 he can not expect anything special outside 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.280
 costs 160000 on the playstation 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.409
 and 50,000 on the xbox now 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 but going as you will notice already 110 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 after the dribbling and after the tempo 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
 what is really about city at 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.810
 So it's fast and super third 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.450
 rise as I deliver the very whole 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.740
 the really big places for him 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840
 fit is okay but nothing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.970
 earth-shattering 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.860
 and then we get a shot of him 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 we catch pretty good with it 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.630
 clubs of music 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.580
 to go we'll see you right two 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.870
 but scored relatively long and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.130
 Maybe do not ask how do you get in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.440
 England's freedom is also relative 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.640
 horny I have to admit good free kick 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.160
 resisted because of that, they are relative 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.280
 Neat the big but I have 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.600
 Rarely I would almost never claim it 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.420
 a formally offensive info from the sun 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.660
 So that's a bad ending 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.680
 was really phenomenal one 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.690
 catastrophe 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.550
 Honestly now in the clubs 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.500
 ideas over and over again from the right and this one 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.200
 normally shot 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.380
 simply from the outside , a whole close 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 very safe thing and aigner has it 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.360
 just never managed since with 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.150
 Actually, take action from time to time 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.680
 as in this case, she will 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.030
 mostly kleinod again both at 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.870
 Turning from ten is maybe 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.830
 a shot at from 80 to 100 percent 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 Chance gone in 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.140
 Of course that is not enough too much 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.390
 little for the right wing player 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.860
 actually relatively good at 40 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.810
 but this is his conclusion and his plan 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.920
 name protection are just too bad he 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.140
 He was a horny long short 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
 Covering so if he is on goal 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.580
 Most of the time he saw it was really dangerous 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.720
 in between his firepower 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.670
 saw his long despite always relative 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.090
 small but you see yourself 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.130
 many have Nebens set the gate and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.140
 then it does not matter if it's his start 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.550
 and sometimes cool looked from time to time 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.750
 the ball will be right 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.519
 dangerous and so yes then shoot 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.890
 you two three times after that and there 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.130
 is what I know where in the new ins 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.860
 next stadium so really on 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.600
 and off with the dribbling and tempo 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.549
 Outstanding, okay, two pictures are always in the picture 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.840
 catastrophe was his left foot could 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.150
 also not used here as well 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.419
 put on the right but also gets the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.669
 He again not tor under and his 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.109
 Shot is more than just a small shot 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.750
 Lotterie I mean, he saw what he did 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.700
 did not set in and then be 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.170
 always so pure was his shot 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.630
 really the biggest lottery i have 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.460
 ever experienced 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.500
 lwg a miracle thing out or fire 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.330
 the thing else where that was really 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.300
 really a bit nerve wracking 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.120
 to play with him 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.400
 now it depends what's worth it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.010
 or worth 60,000 is already 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.590
 a board really like this one player all 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.440
 not everything always works because of that 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.420
 come from my side if you 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.240
 interesting to try 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.400
 then I take his normal card 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.850
 say 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.740
 his shot may not be the same 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.050
 why good free kicks on it and the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.720
 Regulators who are normal as well 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.720
 fast dribble has not 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 good shot on the map here 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.910
 but his shot is shitty one can 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.410
 do not say otherwise if ever one of 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.790
 I get ten shots on it 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.320
 also with most browser players 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.720
 So only if you are just looking for it 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.220
 be with him long to run the line 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.290
 dribble a bit and then 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.510
 to flank purely then maybe 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.240
 exactly your husband and I can do it then 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.410
 you should test it in any case 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.810
 but if you really have a word with it 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.340
 which one can sink long city and 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.500
 The ball just ten times 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.990
 can press over the line then ag is 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.110
 no way or then yes yes 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.030
 either normal or if still 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.600
 Jeffren can be taken right if one 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.460
 porto sporting link does but it is 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.919
 conclusion technically not the true 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.320
 He should be a critical review 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.479
 and here if I like something like that too 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.100
 go know if you wanted to go again 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.870
 almost only the positive aspects show 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.430
 because one had said these 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.870
 Expresses also failed attempts 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.440
 show I thought I would do that 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.070
 this time here 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.660
 and with this one loses which one completely 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.610
 Just here and really happy 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.100
 if your video is moved and comment 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.540
 can and then if I john at 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.160
 next video again, no idea synonymous 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.810
 but a second one comes 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.810
 let's see you until next time
