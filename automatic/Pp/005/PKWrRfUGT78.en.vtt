00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.850
 I'm Anna Sauló, dietician nutritionist for Alimenta. 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.340
 In this video, I will explain how an anthropometric test is performed in the consultation 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.450
 of sports nutrition. 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.630
 An anthropometry consists in the realization of corporal measurements that have a long 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.730
 travel in physical activity, in the sports sciences and more and more 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.919
 applying in consultations and in biomedical sciences. 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.800
 Anthropometry is the measurement of height, weight, skin folds, 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 perimeters and diameters and allows to establish three fundamental pillars in an athlete. 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.870
 The first its proportionality, the second is to know what is its somatotype or its biotype, 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.040
 which means knowing what your body shape is, and the third and the most important is to establish 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.749
 or estimate your body composition, that is, know how much lean mass you have and how much 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.491
 Fat mass has and thus be able to better establish an appropriate treatment. 

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:11.159
 The realization of anthropometry in sports nutrition consultation helps us 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.180
 of several things. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.060
 First of all to establish the body composition that the person has and thus be able to 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.770
 establish a better dietary treatment. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.969
 Secondly, in order to assess the before and after, that is, to see the improvement that 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.760
 has had this person in his treatment. 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.710
 And in third place to see the improvements that athletes have in their performance and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.770
 in its body composition. 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.950
 Precision material is used to perform the anthropometry, one of them is the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.159
 plicmetro, to obtain skin folds. 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.079
 We also have the anthropometer, for the measurement of bone diameters. 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.930
 A tape measure for the measurement of the perimeters, apart from a scale and a 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 stadiometer 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.719
 And the pencil of gluttony to make the corporal marks. 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.649
 Here we have Xavi Pérez, professional footballer, and we are going to do an anthropometry. 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.720
 First of all we have to bear in mind that anthropometry is always going to be carried out 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.030
 on the right side of the body. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.860
 Anthropometry consists of 17 measures, including eight skin folds, 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.020
 three bone diameters and the rest of the perimeter. 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.000
 We will mark the body and the anatomical points of interest. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.720
 With the plymetry that we have commented before we are going to take the first skin fold to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:59.960
 Triceps level, then, with the anthropometer, we will take the diameter of the humerus. 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:16.480
 And when we finish with the anthropometric tape, we are going to measure the circunferéncia or the perimeter 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 Of the waist. 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.280
 In Alimenta we can make an anthropometric study, which will allow you to estimate 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.540
 your body composition, know what your biotype is and analyze the progress you make 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.650
 with dietary treatment and your training. 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.350
 And remember that by eating well, you improve your health.
