the fans are there's kind of like a blue
stripe<00:04:01.420> there<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.720> didn't<00:04:02.020> really<00:04:02.200> bother<00:04:02.380> with

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
stripe there I didn't really bother with

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.920 
stripe there I didn't really bother with
that<00:04:02.830> but<00:04:03.130> there<00:04:03.610> was<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> blue<00:04:04.360> stripe<00:04:04.630> on<00:04:04.840> the

that but there was a blue stripe on the
side<00:04:04.960> of<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.260> graphics<00:04:05.590> card<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:06.010> see

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
side of the graphics card as you see

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.850 
side of the graphics card as you see
here<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:07.270> cut<00:04:07.690> final<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.350> same<00:04:08.560> shape

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
here and I cut final in the same shape

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.220 
here and I cut final in the same shape
and<00:04:09.090> put<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.300> there<00:04:10.480> as<00:04:10.660> permanent<00:04:11.110> outdoor

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
and put it on there as permanent outdoor

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.810 
and put it on there as permanent outdoor
vinyl<00:04:11.710> so<00:04:11.800> it's<00:04:11.920> not<00:04:12.070> coming<00:04:12.250> off<00:04:12.400> to<00:04:12.640> kind<00:04:12.790> of

it just made the build look so much
cleaner<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.370> definitely<00:05:24.940> was<00:05:25.210> worth<00:05:25.419> the

cleaner and definitely was worth the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.060 
and I thought it was a perfect scheme
for<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.720> computer<00:05:35.470> as<00:05:35.560> well<00:05:35.710> underneath

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
for this computer as well underneath

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.620 
for this computer as well underneath
that<00:05:36.370> since<00:05:36.639> we<00:05:36.729> can't<00:05:36.910> see<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.180> power<00:05:37.330> supply

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
that since we can't see the power supply

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.350 
that since we can't see the power supply
underneath<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.530> is<00:05:38.710> a<00:05:38.740> Corsair<00:05:39.370> RM<00:05:39.760> 750

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
underneath that is a Corsair RM 750

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.620 
underneath that is a Corsair RM 750
nothing<00:05:40.960> special<00:05:41.199> just<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.590> 750<00:05:42.250> watt<00:05:42.760> modular

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
nothing special just a 750 watt modular

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.390 
nothing special just a 750 watt modular
power<00:05:43.750> supply<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.860> computer<00:05:45.220> is<00:05:45.310> only

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
power supply this computer is only

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.219 
power supply this computer is only
pulling<00:05:45.639> about<00:05:45.850> 350<00:05:46.600> watts<00:05:46.780> so<00:05:46.960> it's<00:05:47.110> more

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
pulling about 350 watts so it's more

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.689 
pulling about 350 watts so it's more
than<00:05:47.410> enough<00:05:47.530> but<00:05:48.100> that<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.340> pretty<00:05:48.460> much<00:05:48.580> it

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
than enough but that is pretty much it

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.760 
than enough but that is pretty much it
for<00:05:48.880> this<00:05:49.210> build<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.720> had<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.350> much<00:05:50.470> fun

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
building in the H 440 it was a blast

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.870 
building in the H 440 it was a blast
this<00:05:53.650> computer<00:05:54.070> just<00:05:54.340> turned<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.669> so
