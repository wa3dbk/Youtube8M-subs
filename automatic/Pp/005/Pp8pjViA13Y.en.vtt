when they actually announced this in the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.190 
when they actually announced this in the
first<00:01:16.560> place<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.970> we're<00:01:18.630> mainly<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
first place because we're mainly the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
first place because we're mainly the
thing<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:19.680> sold<00:01:20.070> me<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.490> game<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.060> the

thing which sold me on this game is the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120

actual<00:01:21.630> setting<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> think

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
actual setting of it and that is I think

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
actual setting of it and that is I think
one<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.270> extreme<00:01:25.020> highlights<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
one of the extreme highlights of it so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.300 
one of the extreme highlights of it so

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
that sort of thing that bothered a lot

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.400 
that sort of thing that bothered a lot
of<00:03:12.100> people<00:03:12.460> we<00:03:12.760> check<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.090> fine<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:14.050> really

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
of people we check in fine so it really

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.140 
of people we check in fine so it really
depends<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.010> what<00:03:15.370> sort<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.670> stance<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.090> are

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
depends on what sort of stance you are

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.900 
depends on what sort of stance you are
in<00:03:16.510> terms<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.140> what<00:03:17.350> games<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
in terms of what games you like if you

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.030 
in terms of what games you like if you
do<00:03:19.060> like<00:03:19.240> lots<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.570> cinematic<00:03:20.080> games<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:20.740> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
do like lots of cinematic games then I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.400 
do like lots of cinematic games then I
think<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.640> cutscenes<00:03:22.060> are<00:03:22.270> fine<00:03:22.480> letting<00:03:23.290> on

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
think the cutscenes are fine letting on

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.230 
think the cutscenes are fine letting on
to<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.740> action<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.580> game<00:03:24.700> now<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.090> is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
to the action of the game now this is

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.230 
to the action of the game now this is
where<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.450> think<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.959> game<00:03:26.170> has<00:03:26.200> its<00:03:26.709> biggest

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
where I think the game has its biggest

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.630 
where I think the game has its biggest
downfall<00:03:28.800> sadly<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.830> lot<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.130> people<00:03:30.340> complain

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.520 
I actually have a problem again with the
QT<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.300> don't<00:03:34.450> mind<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> boss<00:03:34.990> fights<00:03:35.230> with

I've like played like heavy rain in the
hotel<00:03:39.670> game<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.390> do<00:03:40.870> sort<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.410> get<00:03:41.530> used<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
hotel game so you do sort of get used to

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.130 
hotel game so you do sort of get used to
that<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.160> just<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.670> expect<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.630> from<00:03:43.959> this

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140

that you just had to expect it from this
sort<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.470> game<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.800> think<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.070> more<00:03:45.250> action

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
sort of game I think the more action

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.370 
sort of game I think the more action
downfall<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.360> me<00:03:46.480> was<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.050> shooting

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
downfall for me was like shooting

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380 
downfall for me was like shooting
mechanics<00:03:47.890> were<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.520> mean<00:03:49.030> they<00:03:49.239> were<00:03:49.300> all

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
mechanics were I mean they were all

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.449 
mechanics were I mean they were all
right<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:50.380> they<00:03:50.560> didn't<00:03:50.860> feel<00:03:51.100> like

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
right but they didn't feel like

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.970 
right but they didn't feel like
something<00:03:51.940> which<00:03:52.120> could<00:03:52.600> have<00:03:52.720> been<00:03:52.870> like<00:03:53.770> in

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
something which could have been like in

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.350 
something which could have been like in
Victorian<00:03:54.550> England<00:03:54.850> again<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.150> know<00:03:55.330> it's

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
Victorian England again I know it's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.570 
Victorian England again I know it's
alternate<00:03:56.020> history<00:03:56.500> but<00:03:56.800> they<00:03:57.220> didn't<00:03:57.459> do

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
alternate history but they didn't do

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.060 
alternate history but they didn't do
anything<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.360> creative<00:03:59.110> with<00:03:59.380> combat<00:03:59.830> which

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
anything that creative with combat which

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.250 
anything that creative with combat which
I<00:04:00.280> would<00:04:00.640> have<00:04:00.760> liked<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.420> lot<00:04:01.600> more<00:04:01.840> even<00:04:02.170> if

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
I would have liked a lot more even if

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.050 
I would have liked a lot more even if
they<00:04:02.380> were<00:04:02.440> taken<00:04:02.950> out<00:04:03.070> some<00:04:03.250> more<00:04:03.400> combat<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
they were taken out some more combat and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.449 
they were taken out some more combat and
said<00:04:04.750> added<00:04:05.110> some<00:04:05.410> other<00:04:05.770> mechanic<00:04:06.370> like

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
said added some other mechanic like

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.670 
said added some other mechanic like
investigations<00:04:07.239> or<00:04:07.540> whatnot<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.170> would

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
investigations or whatnot that would

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.199 
investigations or whatnot that would
have<00:04:08.800> in<00:04:08.950> my<00:04:08.980> opinion<00:04:09.220> being<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.000> lot<00:04:10.150> more

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
have in my opinion being a lot more

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.150 
have in my opinion being a lot more
suited<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.900> game<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.800> wouldn't<00:04:12.040> have

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
suited to the game and it wouldn't have

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.770 
suited to the game and it wouldn't have
come<00:04:12.430> into<00:04:12.550> this<00:04:12.730> problem<00:04:13.090> where<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.330> was<00:04:13.630> just

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
come into this problem where I was just

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.050 
come into this problem where I was just
like<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.410> there<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.100> not<00:04:15.220> that

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
like it's in there but it's not that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.240 
like it's in there but it's not that
interesting<00:04:16.419> also<00:04:17.320> they<00:04:17.590> pumped<00:04:17.890> up<00:04:18.010> these

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
interesting also they pumped up these

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.130 
interesting also they pumped up these
enemies<00:04:18.760> called<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.180> Lycans<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:19.930> when<00:04:20.049> you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
enemies called the Lycans but when you

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.870 
enemies called the Lycans but when you
actually<00:04:20.380> vers<00:04:20.830> them<00:04:21.070> in<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.310> game<00:04:21.489> they<00:04:21.700> just

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
actually vers them in the game they just

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.120 
actually vers them in the game they just
do<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.210> repeat<00:04:22.660> cycle<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:23.950> use

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
do this repeat cycle you can just use

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.590 
do this repeat cycle you can just use
the<00:04:24.280> same

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
the same

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.030 
the same
strategy<00:04:24.960> every<00:04:25.170> time<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.530> just<00:04:25.710> stand<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:25.980> a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
strategy every time I just stand in a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.920 
strategy every time I just stand in a
corner<00:04:26.280> dodge<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.150> then<00:04:27.270> come<00:04:27.480> back<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.780> mean

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
corner dodge and then come back I mean

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.680 
corner dodge and then come back I mean
it's<00:04:28.260> just<00:04:28.380> sort<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.190> lazy<00:04:29.580> in<00:04:30.000> that<00:04:30.210> regards

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
it's just sort of lazy in that regards

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.880 
it's just sort of lazy in that regards
maybe<00:04:30.870> they<00:04:31.050> just<00:04:31.140> didn't<00:04:31.380> have<00:04:31.500> enough<00:04:31.530> time

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
maybe they just didn't have enough time

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.040 
maybe they just didn't have enough time
to<00:04:31.950> fix<00:04:32.280> him<00:04:32.400> up<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:32.760> I<00:04:32.940> would<00:04:33.150> wish<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.540> they

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
to fix him up but I would wish that they

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.320 
to fix him up but I would wish that they
would<00:04:34.200> have<00:04:34.260> explored<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.700> lot<00:04:36.120> more

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
would have explored that a lot more

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.390 
would have explored that a lot more
that's<00:04:36.600> sort<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.840> my<00:04:37.020> quick<00:04:37.290> review<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
that's sort of my quick review on the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.120 
that's sort of my quick review on the
game<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:39.000> would<00:04:39.120> give<00:04:39.450> it<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.690> score<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:39.990> 3.5<00:04:40.800> out

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
game I would give it a score of 3.5 out
