00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.439
Lukas from androidnext at IFA 2013.
We're at Samsung Smart Lounge

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.509
with the three probably most interesting

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.559
Android devices we've seen at the fair.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.119
Come closer, let's have a look at them.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.230
Here's the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the new phablet flagship

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.790
with its 5.7inch display.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.460
As always, Samsung uses Super AMOLED technology.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.280
Next to it you see

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.500
the LG G2 -- still a phablet with its
5.2

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.950
inch display using an IPS LCD panel.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.340
This one, with 5 inch and the smallest display,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.000
is the Sony Xperia Z1.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.150
All three phones have in common that a Qualcomm Snapdragon

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.730
800-CPU works in them, clocking at 2.26GHz.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.840
The Xperia Z1 and the G2

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.610
both have 2GB of RAM, the Galaxy Note 3 even

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.280
3 gigs.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.460
Let's turn them around and have a look at the back.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.409
Samsung got rid of its glossy plastic finish

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.630
and now uses something

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.539
that's still plastic, but feels like faux leather

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.810
and even has those tiny stitches.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.750
The LG G2

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.830
still has this glossy plastic back

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.970
with a subtle structure

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.310
as a visual branding.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.490
The Sony Xperia Z1, again, has a glass surface on the back.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.770
One thing immediately stands out: The

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.150
power button at the G2's back.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.719
Both of the other devices

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.689
have it, as usual,

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.539
at one of the sides.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:17.489
Let's talk cameras: The Sony Xperia Z1

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.689
might have the best one with its 20.7MP sensor and Sony's G Lens.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.849
On the LG G2 it's a 13MP sensor,

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.809
and in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 there are 13MP as well.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.299
One of the Galaxy Note 3's main features is

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:43.739
the S Pen stylus, that got enhanced with

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.409
various new capabilities in the third iteration.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.549
I still need to have a closer look at that.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.999
Really interesting. That's what those 3GB of RAM are for

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.099
that the Note 3 has.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.599
Of course, Samsung uses its TouchWiz UI

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.069
again.

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.239
Let's start with the biggest one and work our way through to the smallest one.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.769
All three devices piled up on each other: The

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.279
Xperia Z1 has a relatively large bezel around the display.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.549
That's why the device

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.529
is even a bit bigger than the LG G2, despite the G2's 0.2inch

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.280
bigger screen.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.829
The Galaxy Note 3, of course,

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.969
is the biggest device of the three.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.919
Let's compare displays.
The Super AMOLED display

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.929
has the most vibrant colors.

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.219
LG's display,

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.679
although using LCD-

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.479
and IPS-technology, is very

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.209
color intense, too. This becomes

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.329
even more emphasized by LGs colorful icon theme.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.780
We are, however, a bit puzzled about the Xperia Z1.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.869
It seems that the display has the same

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.739
greyish fog like it was the case

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.949
with the Xperia Z. The Xperia Z Ultra,

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.799
nonetheless, had an outstanding display.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.019
We do not know why that is --

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.719
maybe the devices shown at IFA are

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.879
pre production units.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.909
Lukas for androidnext from IFA 2013 with an overview

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.309
of the most interesting smartphones. See you soon.
