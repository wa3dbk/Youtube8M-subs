okay<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.110> can<00:00:01.260> see<00:00:01.439> in<00:00:01.469> this

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
okay so what you can see in this

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay so what you can see in this
experiment<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.820> have<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.000> drive<00:00:03.570> motor<00:00:03.840> here

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
experiment is we have a drive motor here

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.740 
experiment is we have a drive motor here
that<00:00:04.650> drives<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.160> drive<00:00:05.520> inertia<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.600> go

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
that drives this drive inertia we go

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.570 
that drives this drive inertia we go
through<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.990> belt<00:00:07.290> which<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.710> simulating<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
through a belt which is simulating the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.970 
through a belt which is simulating the
gear<00:00:08.849> system<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.570> load<00:00:09.780> inertia<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
gear system to this load inertia so the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.839 
gear system to this load inertia so the
drive<00:00:11.630> runs<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.530> direction<00:00:13.769> both<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
drive runs in this direction both of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.939 
drive runs in this direction both of
these<00:00:15.030> inertias<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:16.020> shaft<00:00:16.289> encoders<00:00:16.830> on

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
these inertias have shaft encoders on

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.980 
these inertias have shaft encoders on
them<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.000> take<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.359> feedback<00:00:18.570> from

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
them so we can take the feedback from

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.920 
them so we can take the feedback from
these<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.760> encoders<00:00:20.760> go<00:00:21.300> back<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
these two encoders go back to the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.210 
these two encoders go back to the
computer<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.380> implement<00:00:22.859> control

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
computer and implement control

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.970 
computer and implement control
algorithms<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.029> drive<00:00:24.330> hunter<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> here

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
algorithms on this drive hunter so here

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
algorithms on this drive hunter so here
you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.180> model<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.480> got<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> feedback

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you can see the model of got a feedback

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
you can see the model of got a feedback
loop<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:29.039> mechanical<00:00:29.519> plant<00:00:29.730> model<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.119> here

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
loop the mechanical plant model is here

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580 
loop the mechanical plant model is here
and<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.080> i<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.349> my<00:00:31.380> PID<00:00:32.300> controller<00:00:33.469> and<00:00:34.469> i

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and here i have my PID controller and i

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
and here i have my PID controller and i
can<00:00:34.770> set<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.210> proportional<00:00:36.210> derivative<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
can set in proportional derivative and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
can set in proportional derivative and
integral<00:00:37.620> gains<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:39.090> whatever<00:00:39.420> values<00:00:39.719> i

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
integral gains to whatever values i

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.990 
integral gains to whatever values i
choose<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.590> implement<00:00:41.010> any<00:00:41.190> PID<00:00:41.550> control

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
choose and so implement any PID control

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.660 
choose and so implement any PID control
what<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.210> wanted<00:00:42.649> okay<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.710> first<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.340> we're

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what I wanted okay so first of all we're

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.619 
what I wanted okay so first of all we're
going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.850> start<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> simple

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
going to start with a simple

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
going to start with a simple
proportional<00:00:46.170> gain<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> controller<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
proportional gain for the controller and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
proportional gain for the controller and
we're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> execute<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:49.110> closed-loop

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we're going to execute a closed-loop

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
we're going to execute a closed-loop
step<00:00:52.129> ok<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.520> commanded<00:00:54.090> response<00:00:54.449> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
step ok so the commanded response is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
step ok so the commanded response is
shown<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.199> red<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> step<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
shown here in red and of this step and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
shown here in red and of this step and
the<00:00:57.239> actual<00:00:57.539> response<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> shown<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the actual response is shown in here in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
the actual response is shown in here in
green<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> response

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
green and you can see that the response

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
green and you can see that the response
is<00:01:00.809> kinda<00:01:01.140> sluggish<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> big

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is kinda sluggish and we have a big

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
is kinda sluggish and we have a big
steady<00:01:03.690> state<00:01:03.960> offset<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
steady state offset and a little bit of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
steady state offset and a little bit of
obviously<00:01:05.880> will<00:01:06.000> creeping<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.600> certainly

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
obviously will creeping in but certainly

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
obviously will creeping in but certainly
it's<00:01:07.080> too<00:01:07.260> slow<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> has<00:01:08.250> too<00:01:08.490> big<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.790> area<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it's too slow and has too big an area to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's too slow and has too big an area to
be<00:01:09.299> acceptable<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.090> we'll<00:01:12.270> run<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
be acceptable so now we'll run this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470 
be acceptable so now we'll run this
higher<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.229> controller

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.270 

and<00:01:16.870> that<00:01:17.110> speeded<00:01:17.560> things<00:01:17.590> up<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:18.220> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
and that speeded things up but as you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280 
and that speeded things up but as you
can<00:01:18.400> see<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:18.760> puts<00:01:19.000> a<00:01:19.090> lot<00:01:19.120> of<00:01:19.300> oscillation

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
can see it puts a lot of oscillation

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.500 
can see it puts a lot of oscillation
into<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.830> response<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.610> I'm<00:01:21.940> pretty<00:01:22.210> close

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
into the response and I'm pretty close

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.980 
into the response and I'm pretty close
to<00:01:22.720> going<00:01:22.870> on<00:01:23.050> stable<00:01:24.480> so<00:01:25.480> now<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.660> see<00:01:25.840> with

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
to going on stable so now you see with

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.960 
to going on stable so now you see with
the<00:01:26.110> larger<00:01:26.410> proportional<00:01:26.950> gain<00:01:26.980> and<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:27.850> am

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
the larger proportional gain and I am

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.030 
the larger proportional gain and I am
getting<00:01:28.270> better<00:01:28.450> steady-state<00:01:28.960> tracking<00:01:29.680> but

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
getting better steady-state tracking but

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.830 
getting better steady-state tracking but
I've<00:01:30.160> got<00:01:30.310> way<00:01:30.550> too<00:01:30.610> much<00:01:30.940> oscillation<00:01:31.720> in

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
I've got way too much oscillation in

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.860 
I've got way too much oscillation in
this<00:01:31.990> response<00:01:33.000> okay<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:34.060> what<00:01:34.390> I've<00:01:34.480> done<00:01:34.510> now

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
this response okay so what I've done now

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.150 
this response okay so what I've done now
is<00:01:34.900> I've<00:01:35.320> added<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.620> little<00:01:35.830> bit<00:01:35.920> of<00:01:36.040> a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
is I've added a little bit of a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.920 
is I've added a little bit of a
derivative<00:01:36.430> term<00:01:36.910> so<00:01:37.180> now<00:01:37.300> i<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.510> a<00:01:37.570> pd

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
derivative term so now i have a pd

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.750 
derivative term so now i have a pd
proportional<00:01:38.620> plus<00:01:38.770> derivative<00:01:38.890> controller

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
proportional plus derivative controller

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.150 
proportional plus derivative controller
and<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.750> fact<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.050> i<00:01:41.140> allow<00:01:41.500> feedback<00:01:42.010> that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
and the fact that i allow feedback that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.650 
and the fact that i allow feedback that
the<00:01:42.250> derivative<00:01:42.460> gives<00:01:43.240> me<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.480> bit<00:01:43.630> of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
the derivative gives me a bit of

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.780 
the derivative gives me a bit of
anticipation<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.740> should<00:01:45.190> let<00:01:45.310> me<00:01:45.430> run<00:01:45.610> with

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
anticipation and should let me run with

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.780 
anticipation and should let me run with
a<00:01:45.820> much<00:01:46.210> better<00:01:46.450> transient<00:01:46.990> response<00:01:50.730> okay<00:01:51.730> so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
a much better transient response okay so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.220 
a much better transient response okay so
now<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.120> can<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.480> that<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.690> response<00:01:53.140> of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
now you can see that the response of

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.500 
now you can see that the response of
this<00:01:53.320> pd<00:01:53.740> controller<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.340> much<00:01:54.820> improved<00:01:55.030> i

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
this pd controller is much improved i

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.630 
this pd controller is much improved i
get<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.900> much<00:01:56.140> faster<00:01:56.410> response<00:01:56.980> and<00:01:57.250> pretty

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
get a much faster response and pretty

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.430 
get a much faster response and pretty
good<00:01:57.820> steady<00:01:58.120> state<00:01:58.390> tracking<00:01:58.840> although<00:01:59.410> i

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
good steady state tracking although i

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.900 
good steady state tracking although i
still<00:01:59.560> have<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.040> little<00:02:00.310> bit<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.550> steady<00:02:00.820> state

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
still have a little bit of steady state

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.230 
still have a little bit of steady state
edit<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.630> i'd<00:02:01.750> like<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:02.020> get<00:02:02.140> rid<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.090> now

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
edit that i'd like to get rid of so now

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.670 
edit that i'd like to get rid of so now
I've<00:02:04.390> added<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.840> little<00:02:05.020> bit<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.230> integral

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
I've added a little bit of integral

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.850 
I've added a little bit of integral
action<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> have<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.580> true<00:02:06.820> PID<00:02:07.240> controller

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
action so I have a true PID controller

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
action so I have a true PID controller
proportional<00:02:08.860> integral<00:02:09.070> derivative<00:02:09.420> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
proportional integral derivative and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.760 
proportional integral derivative and
what<00:02:10.660> we'll<00:02:10.780> see<00:02:10.960> is<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> very<00:02:11.350> similar

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
what we'll see is a very similar

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.860 
what we'll see is a very similar
transient<00:02:12.280> response<00:02:12.460> but<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> integral

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
transient response but now the integral

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.840 
transient response but now the integral
action<00:02:14.140> will<00:02:14.740> take<00:02:14.770> out<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.550> bit<00:02:15.700> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
action will take out a little bit of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.300 
action will take out a little bit of
steady-state<00:02:16.120> error<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
steady-state error so there you see the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.980 
steady-state error so there you see the
integral<00:02:18.730> responsibility<00:02:19.360> paneer<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.780> steady

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
integral responsibility paneer to steady

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.710 
integral responsibility paneer to steady
state<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> there<00:02:20.740> again<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.360> now<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.690> see

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
state and there again so now you can see

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.900 
state and there again so now you can see
with<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.050> PID<00:02:23.470> controller<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.550> same

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
with the PID controller I get that same

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.810 
with the PID controller I get that same
nice<00:02:25.150> fast<00:02:25.450> response<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.580> minimal<00:02:27.580> little

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
nice fast response with a minimal little

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.460 
nice fast response with a minimal little
bit<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.030> overshoot<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.260> see

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
bit of overshoot but here you can see

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.170 
bit of overshoot but here you can see
how<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> integral<00:02:30.130> part<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> controller

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
how the integral part of the controller

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.300 
how the integral part of the controller
gradually<00:02:32.020> works<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> error<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.950> Texas

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
gradually works on the error in Texas

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.090 
gradually works on the error in Texas
all<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.430> way<00:02:33.520> down<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.760> zero
