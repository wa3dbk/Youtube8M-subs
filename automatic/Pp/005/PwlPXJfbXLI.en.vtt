00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 

the<00:01:57.330> main<00:01:57.510> thing<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.840> detracted<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.380> game

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the main thing that detracted this game

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.140 
the main thing that detracted this game
from<00:01:58.710> being<00:01:58.890> perfect<00:01:59.370> is<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> fact<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.880> even

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
from being perfect is the fact that even

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.340 
from being perfect is the fact that even
though<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.510> puzzles<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.900> good<00:02:01.050> they<00:02:01.290> are

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
though the puzzles are good they are

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.780 
though the puzzles are good they are
quite<00:02:01.530> repetitive<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> seems

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
quite repetitive and it kind of seems

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
quite repetitive and it kind of seems
like<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.970> dumbed<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.300> version<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like a dumbed down version of the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
like a dumbed down version of the
previous<00:02:04.140> games<00:02:04.380> however<00:02:04.800> saying<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.460> some

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
previous games however saying that some

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
previous games however saying that some
of<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> enemies<00:02:06.000> took<00:02:06.300> forever<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> knock<00:02:07.140> out

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
of the enemies took forever to knock out

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
of the enemies took forever to knock out
or<00:02:07.530> kill<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.130> mean<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.580> seriously<00:02:09.090> happened

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.140 

yep<00:02:30.440> another<00:02:31.010> thing<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.460> noticed<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
yep another thing I noticed is that the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.790 
yep another thing I noticed is that the
camera<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.600> pretty<00:02:32.750> awkward<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.710> it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
camera is pretty awkward and that it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.200 
camera is pretty awkward and that it
isn't<00:02:33.950> always<00:02:34.250> behind<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.790> which<00:02:35.030> makes

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
isn't always behind you which makes

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.730 
isn't always behind you which makes
jumping<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.690> trying<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.960> dodge<00:02:36.110> mines<00:02:36.410> really

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
jumping and trying to dodge mines really

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.960 
jumping and trying to dodge mines really
difficult<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.220> playing<00:02:37.430> as<00:02:37.520> much<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
difficult and playing as much in the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.700 
difficult and playing as much in the
swimming<00:02:38.270> areas<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.750> doing<00:02:39.080> tricky<00:02:39.380> jumping

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
swimming areas and doing tricky jumping

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.440 
swimming areas and doing tricky jumping
puzzles<00:02:40.040> camera<00:02:40.670> makes<00:02:40.850> these<00:02:41.030> difficult

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
puzzles camera makes these difficult

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.090 
puzzles camera makes these difficult
because<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:42.140> can't<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:42.680> where<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.070> are

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
because you just can't see where you are

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.560 
because you just can't see where you are
jumping<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.150> difficult<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.510> judge

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
jumping to so it's difficult to judge

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.960 
jumping to so it's difficult to judge
the<00:02:44.810> distance<00:02:44.990> wait<00:02:45.680> no<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.130> take<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.430> back<00:02:46.580> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
the distance wait no I take that back it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.820 
the distance wait no I take that back it
makes<00:02:47.180> even<00:02:47.330> simple<00:02:47.840> jumping<00:02:48.200> difficult<00:02:48.590> but

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
makes even simple jumping difficult but

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.270 
makes even simple jumping difficult but
not<00:02:48.950> impossible<00:02:50.020> me<00:02:51.020> however<00:02:51.560> having<00:02:52.010> said

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
not impossible me however having said

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.010 
not impossible me however having said
that<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.730> game<00:02:52.880> looks<00:02:52.940> amazing<00:02:53.300> considering

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
that the game looks amazing considering

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.930 
that the game looks amazing considering
the<00:02:54.230> first<00:02:54.440> two<00:02:54.560> games<00:02:54.770> are<00:02:54.920> 2d<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.430> 3d<00:02:55.670> world

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the first two games are 2d the 3d world

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
the first two games are 2d the 3d world
adds<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.300> new<00:02:56.420> aspect<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:56.990> game<00:02:57.170> allowing

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
adds a new aspect of the game allowing

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.110 
adds a new aspect of the game allowing
you<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.830> explore<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.250> landscapes<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.910> yeah

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
you to explore the landscapes and yeah

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.310 
you to explore the landscapes and yeah
it<00:02:59.270> looks<00:02:59.450> pretty<00:02:59.870> damn<00:03:00.020> good

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
it looks pretty damn good

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.200 
it looks pretty damn good
especially<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> cutscenes<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:02.060> any

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
especially the cutscenes if I have any

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.730 
especially the cutscenes if I have any
problems<00:03:02.660> with<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.900> Walters<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.290> sometimes

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
problems with the Walters that sometimes

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.170 
problems with the Walters that sometimes
it's<00:03:03.950> pretty<00:03:04.160> vague<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.640> where<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:04.940> need<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it's pretty vague on where you need to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.090 
it's pretty vague on where you need to
go<00:03:05.270> next<00:03:05.480> as<00:03:05.840> later<00:03:06.110> puzzles<00:03:06.470> are<00:03:06.620> also<00:03:06.770> in<00:03:07.040> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
go next as later puzzles are also in the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.980 
go next as later puzzles are also in the
same<00:03:07.130> area<00:03:07.700> meaning<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.330> waste<00:03:08.540> time<00:03:08.780> trying

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
same area meaning you waste time trying

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.540 
same area meaning you waste time trying
to<00:03:09.140> work<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.440> if<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.590> can<00:03:09.890> actually<00:03:10.100> do<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
to work out if you can actually do the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.520 
to work out if you can actually do the
puzzle<00:03:10.880> oh<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.660> if<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.840> do<00:03:11.990> get<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.320> game
