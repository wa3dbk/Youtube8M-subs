00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
or something there was one match where I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.740 
or something there was one match where I
won<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.519> had<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.790> somebody<00:02:33.180> kills<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
won it was I had like somebody kills it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930

was<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> hard<00:02:34.080> point<00:02:34.319> game<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.610> stopped

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
was a hard point game and it stopped

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
was a hard point game and it stopped
when<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.300> was<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.690> 56<00:02:37.319> kills<00:02:37.620> or<00:02:37.830> something

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
when I was at like 56 kills or something

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.589 
when I was at like 56 kills or something
and<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.519> just<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.390> middle<00:02:39.510> of

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
and it just just right in the middle of

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.259 
and it just just right in the middle of
the<00:02:39.690> match<00:02:39.840> cut<00:02:40.140> off<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.459> what<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> think

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the match cut off so what I think

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.869 
the match cut off so what I think
happens<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.230> because<00:02:43.319> I<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.489> do<00:02:44.700> well

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
happens is because I you know do well

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.490 
happens is because I you know do well
and<00:02:45.150> stuff<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.569> get<00:02:45.720> really<00:02:45.959> excited<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and stuff and I get really excited to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500 
and stuff and I get really excited to
screen<00:02:46.800> capture<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.940> I'll<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.300> out<00:02:48.480> of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
screen capture it so I'll back out of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.790 
screen capture it so I'll back out of
the<00:02:48.660> lobby<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.080> stuff<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.590> what<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.739> think

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
the lobby and stuff and what I think

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.339 
the lobby and stuff and what I think
happens<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.629> still<00:02:51.989> rendering

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
happens is that it's still rendering

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.839 
happens is that it's still rendering
that<00:02:52.620> game<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.069> background<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
that game in the background and if you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.290 
that game in the background and if you
leave<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.209> lobby<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:56.040> stops<00:02:56.730> rendering

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
leave the lobby then it stops rendering

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.600 
leave the lobby then it stops rendering
for<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:57.629> reason<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:59.220> game<00:02:59.459> right

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
for some reason so this this game right

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.979 
for some reason so this this game right
here<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.879> actually<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.269> first<00:03:00.300> game<00:03:00.959> that

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
here is actually the first game that

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.530

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
sorry and it was so what I'm thinking is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.509 
sorry and it was so what I'm thinking is
that<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> stay<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.129> there<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
that you have to stay in there it

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.339 
that you have to stay in there it
doesn't<00:03:23.670> tell<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:25.019> think<00:03:25.200> that's

doesn't tell you and I think that's

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.949 
doesn't tell you and I think that's
going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> glitch<00:03:25.890> maybe<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:27.569> servers

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
going to be a glitch maybe the servers

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.630 
going to be a glitch maybe the servers
are<00:03:27.989> running<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.440> little<00:03:28.590> slow<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.310> maybe

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
are running a little slow and maybe

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.399 
are running a little slow and maybe

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.920 
used to the other one let's just all
look<00:04:34.710> split<00:04:35.100> they<00:04:35.729> both<00:04:35.910> work<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.600> about<00:04:36.780> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
look split they both work just about the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.290 
look split they both work just about the
same<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.979> actually<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:38.970> find<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.479> easier<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> get

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
same I actually I find it easier to get

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.020 
same I actually I find it easier to get
stickies<00:04:42.300> with<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.750> crossbow<00:04:43.310> no<00:04:44.310> scoping<00:04:44.850> so

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
stickies with the crossbow no scoping so

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.340 
stickies with the crossbow no scoping so
if<00:04:45.090> you're<00:04:45.210> having<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.449> hard<00:04:45.600> time<00:04:45.660> getting

if you're having a hard time getting

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.650 
if you're having a hard time getting
stickies<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.040> hitting<00:04:47.490> people<00:04:47.789> with<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:48.120> try

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
stickies and hitting people with it try

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.510 
stickies and hitting people with it try
doing<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.930> no<00:04:49.080> scope<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:49.949> little<00:04:50.250> harder

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
doing a no scope it is a little harder

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.210 
doing a no scope it is a little harder
scope<00:04:50.850> up<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:52.680> yeah<00:04:52.830> that's<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:56.070> is

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220
