 Translator: Dani Peteva Reviewer: Anton Hikov 

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.886
 Kyle von Hasseln: This is a 3D Printed Gown. 

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:15.302
 The designer uses wear-friendly, flexible plastic, 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.684
 to create amazing details and volume in your clothes. 

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:23.262
 This is a 3D printed tracheal bus. 

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:26.632
 Doctors from the University of Michigan create a personalized support 

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:30.091
 for the respiratory tract of a baby who is born unable to breathe alone. 

00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:33.246
 Made from bio-absorbent plastic, 

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:36.704
 so it will dissolve in time until the airways build around it. 

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.541
 And this is a 3D printed leg prosthesis. 

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:46.757
 The designer, Scott Summit, uses resin, plastic and metal, 

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:49.257
 to create super-slim designs. 

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.873
 They surpass the idea of ​​just replacing a limb 

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:56.503
 and become an expression of individuality. 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.993
 These 3 projects are examples of the best 3D printer quality 

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.244
 and this really talks a lot, 

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:06.914
 because there are many amazing things about 3D printers. 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.873
 The 3D printer can do something very accurate. 

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:11.663
 It can do it very quickly, 

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:14.745
 can do it with very few materials and very little energy 

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:17.389
 and can do it whenever and wherever you need it. 

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.361
 But he can do more than that. 

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.023
 The 3D printer is more than a 3D photocopy, 

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.685
 he does not copy, 

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.944
 he does something that did not exist before. 

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.813
 And so the dress, the airway bar and the leg prosthesis, 

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.527
 the key to these innovations is that their authors have seen in the 3D printer 

00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:40.741
 more than a device for production, 

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.268
 more than a replicator. 

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.657
 They are asking, 

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:47.903
 "What can I do with this device that was not possible before?" 

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:52.208
 We asked a similar question a few years ago, 

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:55.476
 we had promised to do for our friend Chelsea, a birthday cake. 

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.514
 And as the day approached, we went to a market, 

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.015
 to buy ingredients to make our own cake, 

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.749
 we took them home and unpacked them 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.955
 in our little studio, where we were soon. 

00:02:07.955 --> 00:02:10.814
 And while we were sitting there in the kitchen, 

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:15.378
 we suddenly realized that we did not actually have a stove. 

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:19.829
 (Laugh) 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.066
 We did not have a stove, but we had a 3D printer. 

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:30.935
 So, of course, we were wondering, 

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:35.048
 "Is it possible just to make it a 3D printer cake?" 

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.323
 We tried and tried, recipe after recipe 

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:41.866
 and we used every possible type of sugar we could find, 

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.037
 mixed in any proportion that we thought 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.553
 and after months of experimentation, 

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.655
 which continued after her birthday, 

00:02:51.932 --> 00:02:55.882
 we finally managed to make Chelsea a little glaze for the cake, 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.183
 on which her name was written handwritten with sugar. 

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.665
 She liked it a lot and I realized that 

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.801
 other people will probably also like it. 

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.251
 So after we finished about a year ago, we founded the Sugar Lab, 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.692
 a custom designer for sugar from a 3D printer. 

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:11.981
 Using the same process that we have developed 

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.500
 for Chelsea's cake polish, 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.560
 and this process, on its basis, is very easy. 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.996
 It's actually just adding water to the sugar. 

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:22.802
 And if you've ever made glaze and left the bowl in the sink at night, 

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.683
 you know that the next morning, 

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.233
 it will be impossible to scrape the bowl. 

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.281
 And that's because, when you add water to the sugar, it hardens, 

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.334
 we just add the water in a very precise way. 

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.997
 Liz von Hasseln: Here's how we do this. 

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.385
 We start with a digital, 

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:43.794
 The 3-dimensional pattern of the object we want to print in 3D from sugar. 

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:47.972
 We run this model through software that cuts it into layers. 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.345
 These layers will be set to the 3D printer in one, 

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.180
 starting with the lower one. 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.990
 When this happens, the printer distributes a very fine layer of sugar 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.600
 and uses an inkjet printer head like the ones you have 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.580
 in the printer at home, 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.800
 to color this bottom layer of the object, 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.800
 on the sugar layer, using only water instead of ink. 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.371
 The printer then puts another very fine layer of sugar 

00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:15.790
 on the first one 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.226
 and stains the next layer with water. 

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:21.564
 And he repeats this, often a few thousand times, 

00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:24.964
 until each layer of the object is printed, 

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:26.641
 one above another, 

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.941
 from the bottom layer to the top layer. 

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:34.870
 At this point the digital model, which until a few hours ago 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.280
 we could only see the screen on our computer, 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.500
 layer layer has already been printed 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.270
 as a physical, material object of sugar. 

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:47.626
 We created this particular sugar object as a cake for the cake, 

00:04:47.626 --> 00:04:50.818
 which actually makes it a 3D glaze printed. 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.863
 But you can immediately say that this glaze 

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:55.767
 is different, 

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:58.192
 now the glaze can be structural, 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.215
 may be sculptural, 

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.247
 may be geometric and mathematically accurate. 

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:08.584
 It may have a complicated perforation 

00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:11.776
 or just look like a duck. 

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.857
 (Laugh) 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.362
 This glaze in general may look like almost anything you can think of 

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:20.846
 and can be used in just as many ways. 

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:24.744
 You can print 3D personalized party orders from sugar 

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:30.184
 or strange, small, curly cubes of sugar for your coffee. 

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:33.277
 Or later, you can print a sugar network, 

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:35.987
 in addition to a cocktail recipe. 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.070
 Sugar, when printed on 3D, may start to exceed 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.611
 her usual role in decorating and sweetening. 

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:48.702
 This is a wedding cake we created with Charm City Cakes in Hollywood. 

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.410
 And you see that as soon as sugar becomes structural material, 

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:56.852
 can begin to define and even maintain the shape of the cake itself. 

00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:02.514
 In this case, we decided to print on the 3D cake tray of sugar, 

00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:06.108
 in addition to glaze and other decorations, 

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:10.014
 which is not something you can usually choose to do with glaze. 

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.574
 This is the most exciting part for us, 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.600
 expanding the opportunities, 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.600
 pushing the technology of 3D printing into a completely new genre 

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:24.877
 and looking for what can be done there that has not been done before. 

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:28.402
 What is important to us 

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.559
 about the sugar products we showed you today 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:34.500
 it is not that they are beautiful, but that they were impossible until recently. 

00:06:34.922 --> 00:06:39.472
 We hope you look at them as an invitation, even a challenge. 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.253
 Take 3D printing and use it somewhere else. 

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:48.543
 Put it in a new space of design, a new field, a new discipline. 

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.018
 Bring it to something that's important to you 

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:54.768
 and see how it can increase opportunities there. 

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.913
 This is the best thing about 3D printers, 

00:06:58.076 --> 00:07:01.206
 you can use them to print something impossible. 

00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:05.275
 Kyle and Liz: Thank you. (Applause)
