00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.660 
sort of saw that that was going to be
the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:34.439> things<00:01:34.770> were<00:01:34.950> working<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.520> like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the way things were working i was like

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
the way things were working i was like
i'm<00:01:36.149> not<00:01:36.299> done<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> before<00:01:36.869> how's<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
i'm not done that before how's that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.940 
i'm not done that before how's that
going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:38.930> achieved<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> fact<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
going to be achieved and but the fact is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to be achieved and but the fact is
this<00:01:41.130> film<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.579> multi-layered<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this film is so multi-layered it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.109 
this film is so multi-layered it
requires<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.979> kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.219> requires<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.000> know

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
requires it kind of requires it you know

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.260 
requires it kind of requires it you know
Chris<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:46.079> there<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:47.210> different<00:01:48.210> reason

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
Chris I was there for a different reason

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
Chris I was there for a different reason
to<00:01:48.570> Chris<00:01:48.750> being<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> way<00:01:49.259> they're<00:01:49.439> both

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to Chris being in a way they're both

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.560 
to Chris being in a way they're both
doing<00:01:49.920> certain<00:01:50.369> things<00:01:50.490> which<00:01:50.939> need<00:01:50.969> doing

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
doing certain things which need doing

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.950 
doing certain things which need doing
and<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.219> means<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> larger

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and it just means that there's a larger

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.529 
and it just means that there's a larger
sort<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.399> overview<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.789> film<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.329> on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
set and it's been incredibly helpful in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
set and it's been incredibly helpful in
harmonious<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.890> great<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> have

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
harmonious and it's great to have

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670
