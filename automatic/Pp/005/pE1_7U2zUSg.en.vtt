amongst other motorists yeah back in the
day<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:21.090> didn't<00:00:21.359> think<00:00:21.480> too<00:00:21.630> much<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> horns<00:00:22.230> we

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
day we didn't think too much of horns we

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.810 
day we didn't think too much of horns we
would<00:00:22.680> usually<00:00:22.859> bolt<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> those

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
would usually bolt on one of those

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.019 
would usually bolt on one of those
little<00:00:24.320> horns<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.519> meant<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> log

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
little horns and that meant the log

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
little horns and that meant the log
that's<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.960> cared<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.650> OE

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that's all we really cared about the OE

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
that's all we really cared about the OE
horns<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> little<00:00:31.230> usually<00:00:31.740> little<00:00:32.009> round

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
horns are a little usually little round

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
maybe on a good day so here's a lot of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
maybe on a good day so here's a lot of
arrow<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> stock

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
arrow here and this is what the stock

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.529 
arrow here and this is what the stock
horn<00:00:41.700> sounds<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.030> hear<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
horn sounds like so as you can hear the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.510 
horn sounds like so as you can hear the
pitch<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.170> particular<00:00:46.829> horn<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> very

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
pitch of that particular horn is very

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.600 
pitch of that particular horn is very
sharp<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.930> amongst<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:50.219> kinds<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
sharp and out amongst all other kinds of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
sharp and out amongst all other kinds of
traffic<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.719> loud<00:00:52.079> yeah

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
traffic it's not really that loud yeah

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.680 
traffic it's not really that loud yeah
and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> gets<00:00:52.710> masked<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.550> surrounding<00:00:54.270> noises

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and it gets masked by surrounding noises

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
and it gets masked by surrounding noises
cars<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> motors<00:00:57.059> tires<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
cars you know the motors tires that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.790 
cars you know the motors tires that
really<00:00:58.710> gets<00:00:58.949> almost<00:00:59.879> almost<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.930> heard<00:01:01.140> now

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
really gets almost almost not heard now

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200 
really gets almost almost not heard now
the<00:01:01.859> same<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.219> corner<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.460> front<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> us<00:01:02.940> here

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the same one corner in front of us here

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
the same one corner in front of us here
is<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.660> similar<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> wool<00:01:04.500> Oh<00:01:04.739> from

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is very similar to the wool Oh from

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
is very similar to the wool Oh from
Kuryakyn<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.880> several<00:01:06.299> others<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:06.750> on

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
Kuryakyn or several others out there on

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.060 
Kuryakyn or several others out there on
the<00:01:07.080> market<00:01:07.439> yeah<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> cool<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:07.950> about

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the market yeah the cool thing about

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
the market yeah the cool thing about
this<00:01:08.369> horn<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.360> know<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.780> have

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this horn is and I know because I have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.859 
this horn is and I know because I have
one<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.260> key<00:01:10.439> TM<00:01:10.650> 690<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.570> pump

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
one of my key TM 690 that the the pump

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
one of my key TM 690 that the the pump
and<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.830> horn<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:15.060> self<00:01:15.360> contained<00:01:15.720> in

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and the horn are all self contained in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
and the horn are all self contained in
one<00:01:16.080> small<00:01:16.380> unit<00:01:16.640> literally<00:01:17.640> takes<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.210> bolt

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
one small unit literally takes one bolt

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
one small unit literally takes one bolt
to<00:01:19.170> install<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> Greg<00:01:20.430> mentioned<00:01:20.700> mounting

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to install this Greg mentioned mounting

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
to install this Greg mentioned mounting
of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.479> horn<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> extremely<00:01:22.290> simple<00:01:22.500> one

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of the horn is extremely simple one

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.440 
of the horn is extremely simple one
single<00:01:23.400> bolt<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> you've<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.180> got

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
single bolt and you've pretty much got

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.890 
single bolt and you've pretty much got
it<00:01:24.479> covered

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it covered

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.289 
it covered
now<00:01:25.500> wiring<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> horn<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.180> bit

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
now wiring of the horn is a little bit

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.850 
now wiring of the horn is a little bit
more<00:01:27.479> than<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.110> bull<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.770> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
more than just one bull but it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.440 
more than just one bull but it's
actually<00:01:29.189> still<00:01:29.430> pretty<00:01:29.460> simple<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
actually still pretty simple with the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually still pretty simple with the
use<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> relay<00:01:31.049> yeah<00:01:31.500> relays<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.070> important

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
use of a relay yeah relays are important

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
use of a relay yeah relays are important
because<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:33.540> without<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> you're<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.290> blow

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
because if without it you're gonna blow

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.319 
because if without it you're gonna blow
the<00:01:34.740> horn<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.790> melt<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.119> wiring

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the horn or you're you melt your wiring

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
the horn or you're you melt your wiring
harness<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> relay<00:01:37.560> you're

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
harness so with the relay you're

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.380 
harness so with the relay you're
basically<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> wire<00:01:38.430> from<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.700> switch<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
basically have a wire from your switch a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
basically have a wire from your switch a
wire<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> ground<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.530> you've<00:01:40.650> got<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
wire to ground and then you've got the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
wire to ground and then you've got the
positive<00:01:41.040> negative<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> horn<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
positive negative on the horn and it's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.639 
positive negative on the horn and it's
pretty<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> simple

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
pretty much that simple
