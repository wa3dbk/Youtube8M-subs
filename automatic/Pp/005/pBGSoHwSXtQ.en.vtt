burning question that everyone has which
is<00:00:14.520> what<00:00:15.520> is<00:00:15.940> a<00:00:16.299> reactor<00:00:16.750> panel<00:00:17.020> saddle<00:00:17.350> how

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
is what is a reactor panel saddle how

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.130 
is what is a reactor panel saddle how
does<00:00:18.190> it<00:00:18.310> work<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:18.670> how<00:00:18.850> is<00:00:18.970> it<00:00:19.090> different<00:00:19.210> so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
does it work and how is it different so

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.140 
does it work and how is it different so
I'll<00:00:20.860> give<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.520> little<00:00:21.640> bit<00:00:21.790> of<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.940> tour

more of in just a moment they also

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.760 
more of in just a moment they also
because<00:01:49.359> they're<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.539> dense<00:01:49.840> rubber<00:01:50.109> act<00:01:50.530> as<00:01:50.740> a

because they're a dense rubber act as a

because they're a dense rubber act as a

they're<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:54.909> velcro<00:01:55.270> they<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.320> be<00:01:56.439> almost

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
they're on velcro they can be almost

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.160 
they're on velcro they can be almost
infinitely<00:01:57.579> repositioned<00:01:58.570> which<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.960> how<00:01:59.109> we

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
infinitely repositioned which is how we

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.050 
infinitely repositioned which is how we
get<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.469> custom<00:01:59.950> fit<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.549> I'll<00:02:00.729> show<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:00.939> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
get a custom fit and I'll show you that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.989 
get a custom fit and I'll show you that
in<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.479> moment<00:02:01.630> too<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.609> panel<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
in a moment too so the panel is

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.340 
in a moment too so the panel is
kidney-shaped<00:02:06.999> and<00:02:07.479> if<00:02:07.570> you've<00:02:07.780> looked<00:02:08.170> at

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
kidney-shaped and if you've looked at

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.930 
kidney-shaped and if you've looked at
any<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.679> our<00:02:08.800> videos<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.429> show<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:09.880> to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
any of our videos that show you how to

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.940 
any of our videos that show you how to
chart<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.479> area<00:02:10.780> available<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.500> saddle

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
chart the area available to saddle

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.000 
chart the area available to saddle
you'll<00:02:12.640> see<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:14.019> curved<00:02:14.349> top<00:02:14.680> line

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you'll see that this curved top line
