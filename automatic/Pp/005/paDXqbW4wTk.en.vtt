00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
I want to learn more and I think that

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.490 
I want to learn more and I think that

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
for from a Westerners perspective being

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.189 
for from a Westerners perspective being
able<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.860> see<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.460> documentary<00:05:37.360> like<00:05:37.599> this<00:05:37.900> that

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
able to see a documentary like this that

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.379

does intertwine a life with the country

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.689 
does intertwine a life with the country
is<00:05:40.570> is<00:05:41.560> so<00:05:41.889> important<00:05:42.550> in<00:05:43.449> as<00:05:43.810> we<00:05:44.550> confront<00:05:45.550> the

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
is is so important in as we confront the

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.029
