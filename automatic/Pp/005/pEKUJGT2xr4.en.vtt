00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
so it's interesting that the State

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.260 
so it's interesting that the State
Department<00:05:04.590> doesn't<00:05:04.740> mention<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.370> or<00:05:05.670> that

shirt<00:05:06.630> off<00:05:06.810> downplays<00:05:07.350> this<00:05:07.650> but<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.190> think

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
shirt off downplays this but I think

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.420 
shirt off downplays this but I think
it's<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.090> very<00:05:09.210> serious<00:05:09.750> issue<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.170> I<00:05:10.890> believe

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
it's a very serious issue and I believe

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.270 
it's a very serious issue and I believe
that<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.700> cartels<00:05:12.150> are<00:05:12.450> are<00:05:13.020> able<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.950> buy<00:05:14.100> out

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
that the cartels are are able to buy out

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.980 
that the cartels are are able to buy out
some<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.700> Mexican<00:05:15.120> military<00:05:15.210> personnel
