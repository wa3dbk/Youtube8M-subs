00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.780
 but 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.810
 but the white lies find my life 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.360
 work was devoted to the theory 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.110
 of numbers , number theory is mine 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.360
 passion what is number theory 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.780
 concerns the resolution of equations 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.309
 equations the integers if we take 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.910
 for example the hicks equation 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.489
 second plus one equal 7 the solution is 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 the square root of 6 and this is not 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.420
 a whole number 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.219
 the goal is to solve equations i 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:56.170
 integers ie numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.989
 and so on and not always tried to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.699
 solve equations the integers in 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.670
 origin they tried to solve 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.060
 equations perhaps irrational numbers or 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.310
 in other types of numbers but back 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 to antiquity when these were born 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.820
 problems 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.780
 we know that the Babylonians noted 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.610
 on their tablets 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.190
 solutions of equations of the type I have 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.439
 just described they were trying to 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.830
 solve the hicks equation on the second 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.049
 more y to the second equal c to the second 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.049
 is the famous problem of the triad 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.189
 Pythagorean on the tablets are visible 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.009
 long lists of solutions we do not know 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.900
 exactly how they found them but 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.979
 we can assume that they were useful to 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.290
 some kind of day measurement then 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.200
 Pythagoras his disciples described a 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.360
 theorem a geometric theorem which 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030
 establishes a relationship between sums of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.220
 squares and so they explained that the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.040
 square built on the hypotenuse is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.690
 equal to the sum of the squares built 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.100
 on the other two sides this 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.170
 solution to the geometric problem of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.990
 Pythagoras allows us to understand the reason 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 so the Babylonian skilled architects 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:21.260
 were so interested by these 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.300
 equations but in reality they were only i 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.280
 to really devote themselves to research 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.010
 of the whole solutions of this 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.990
 equation is just because they couldn't 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.030
 do otherwise 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.770
 to solve these equations they had a 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.710
 only the integers available 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.840
 maybe the national numbers in a certain 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.850
 meaning is not a natural search and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.070
 only a thousand and five hundred years later 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.910
 the resolution of number equations 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.120
 Whole has become a problem in itself 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.120
 exciting sec 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.530
 after studying by the Greeks in 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.420
 diophantus detail for a long time 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.760
 the subject was not investigated 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.580
 seriously as other branches of the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.640
 mathematics until the beginning of the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.260
 six hundred issues of this kind 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:16.670
 fascinated a French mathematician who 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.500
 it was called pierre de fermat firm came 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.540
 aware of Greek studies 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 thanks to a copy of a book by 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.170
 diophantus that had been cured by a 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.030
 French named bascelli and on the margins 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.780
 of this book noted observations 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.940
 personal problems he devised and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.940
 occasionally the solutions found 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.769
 he also had the habit of 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.450
 write to other mathematicians in 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.700
 particular to English mathematicians 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.160
 of the time and challenging them to solve i 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.750
 problems that had solved advanced soft 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.690
 find a square and a cube for 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.840
 example whose difference is equal to 2 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.400
 or to 4 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.340
 in other words it is solving the equation 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.700
 the second y plus 2 equals to hicks 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.540
 third oy a second plus 4 equal hicks 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.950
 to the third 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.500
 indeed faust firm discovered some methods 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.829
 remarkable for finding solutions in 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.840
 particular starting from a solution e 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.350
 using it to generate many more 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.509
 even an infinite number was also in 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 able to prove that certain equations 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.979
 of this kind they have no solutions 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.970
 thus remaining even more perplexity 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.970
 his contemporaries 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.890
 pierre de fermat born in france a 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.890
 beaumont de lomagne in 1601 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.479
 he studies law and becomes a magistrate at 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.580
 parliament of tolosa work 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.759
 judicial occupies much of its time 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.089
 but he manages to dedicate a part to his own 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.939
 passion mathematics thanks 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.919
 to the extraordinary contribution that even from 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.339
 self-taught for modern mathematics 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.759
 he is often remembered as the prince 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.759
 of amateurs 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.550
 his main interest is 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.920
 to the theory of numbers approaching 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.180
 thanks to the work of the Greek mathematician of 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.610
 Often arithmetic by studying problems 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.650
 proposed in the book stop faces 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.830
 reasoning and research solutions more 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.390
 thin unfortunately destines the 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.970
 most of his notes to 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.210
 basket but some comments find 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.610
 space on the margin of these pages 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.290
 quick notes would become 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.890
 a very precious document for 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.770
 generations of mathematicians thanks to 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.780
 some brilliant intuitions the prince 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.540
 of amateurs reaches a certain 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.460
 reputation that is expanded by a 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.830
 series of arduous mathematical challenges 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.830
 launch to his colleagues of the time 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.160
 in 1637 while studying the book ii 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.500
 of arithmetic notes on the margins of one 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.610
 page an apparently very equation 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.180
 simple 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.790
 and yet unsolvable without providing 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.150
 explanations write a comment that will be 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.110
 accepted as a challenge in future centuries 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.380
 I have a wonderful one 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.450
 demonstration of this theorem which does not 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:52.010
 can be contained in the margin too 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:56.180
 close of the page with his death 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:59.110
 in 1665 the discoveries of but occurred 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.970
 they risk being lost forever 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.160
 fortunately his annotations are 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.290
 collected by the son who decides to 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.160
 publish them in a special edition 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.160
 arithmetic 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:15.349
 in this way the last theorem of 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:17.930
 fermat becomes known throughout the world e 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:21.639
 for more than three hundred years the withdraws 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.639
 brightest minds on the planet
