off so we have to replace our rear
derailleur<00:00:49.730> alright<00:00:50.730> first<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.149> we're

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
derailleur alright first thing we're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.400 
derailleur alright first thing we're
going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> remove<00:00:52.140> our

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
going to do is we're going to remove our

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:06.180 
going to do is we're going to remove our
cable

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.220 

use<00:01:07.190> our<00:01:07.340> park<00:01:07.550> tool<00:01:07.730> for<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.080> there<00:01:09.080> is<00:01:09.200> a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
use our park tool for that there is a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.370 
use our park tool for that there is a
difference<00:01:09.560> between<00:01:09.650> gear<00:01:10.040> cables<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.610> and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
difference between gear cables and and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.500 
difference between gear cables and and
brake<00:01:12.380> cables<00:01:12.740> gear<00:01:13.460> casing<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.210> brake

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
brake cables gear casing and brake

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.230 
brake cables gear casing and brake
casing<00:01:15.080> there<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.410> a<00:01:15.440> major<00:01:15.950> major<00:01:16.550> different

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
casing there is a major major different

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.610 
casing there is a major major different
brake<00:01:17.750> casing<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:19.210> curled<00:01:20.210> around<00:01:20.360> as<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.470> can

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
brake casing is curled around as you can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.850 
brake casing is curled around as you can
see<00:01:21.830> here<00:01:24.580> gear<00:01:25.580> casing<00:01:26.710> has<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> bunch<00:01:28.220> of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
see here gear casing has a bunch of

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.740 
see here gear casing has a bunch of
separate<00:01:30.860> cables<00:01:31.370> wrapped<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.090> one<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.509> makes

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
separate cables wrapped in one it makes

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.040 
separate cables wrapped in one it makes
it<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.050> lot<00:01:33.259> stiffer<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:35.240> there's<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.570> difference

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
it a lot stiffer so there's a difference

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.280 
it a lot stiffer so there's a difference
between<00:01:36.200> brake<00:01:36.979> casing<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.700> gear<00:01:38.180> casing<00:01:38.780> it

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
between brake casing and gear casing it

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.130 
between brake casing and gear casing it
is<00:01:39.530> very<00:01:39.920> important<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.240> don't<00:01:41.509> not<00:01:41.750> do

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
is very important that you don't not do

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.980 
is very important that you don't not do
not<00:01:42.350> mix<00:01:42.770> them<00:01:42.979> up<00:01:43.040> if<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:44.270> use<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.540> brake

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
not mix them up if you use a brake

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.950 
not mix them up if you use a brake
casing<00:01:45.619> on<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.100> gear<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:47.479> not<00:01:47.720> going<00:01:47.900> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
casing on the gear it's not going to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.410 
casing on the gear it's not going to
shift<00:01:48.050> because<00:01:48.740> it's<00:01:48.890> not<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.190> stiff<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.240> it's

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
shift because it's not as stiff so it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.630 
shift because it's not as stiff so it's
not<00:01:50.540> going<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.810> shift<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.290> smoothly<00:01:51.680> if<00:01:52.070> you

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
not going to shift it smoothly if you

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.359 
not going to shift it smoothly if you
use<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.149> gear<00:01:53.630> casing<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.830> brake<00:01:55.100> cable

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
use a gear casing on the brake cable

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.920 
use a gear casing on the brake cable
there's<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:55.940> too<00:01:56.180> much<00:01:56.300> tension<00:01:56.660> and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
there's going to be too much tension and

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.780 
there's going to be too much tension and
it's<00:01:57.140> going<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.320> blow<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.950> casing<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
it's going to blow out the casing and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.030 
it's going to blow out the casing and
your<00:01:58.970> brakes<00:01:59.210> are<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.630> fail<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.770> it's

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
your brakes are going to fail so it's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.330 
your brakes are going to fail so it's
important<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:01.700> keep<00:02:01.880> them<00:02:02.119> separate

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
important that you keep them separate

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.460 
important that you keep them separate
this<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.580> pretty<00:02:04.850> bent<00:02:08.080> well<00:02:09.080> having<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.380> have

this is pretty bent well having to have

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.490 
this is pretty bent well having to have
to<00:02:09.560> rebuild<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:14.420> more<00:02:14.600> examining<00:02:15.319> than

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to rebuild that do more examining than

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.220 
to rebuild that do more examining than

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
about should we take those wheels in

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.610 
about should we take those wheels in
those<00:02:54.880> 24<00:02:55.360> inch<00:02:55.569> tires<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.319> room<00:02:56.590> for

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
those 24 inch tires do you have room for

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.140 
those 24 inch tires do you have room for
that<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.819> drop<00:02:58.150> out<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.660> too<00:02:58.900> bad<00:03:00.030> but<00:03:01.030> we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that the drop out is not too bad but we

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.610 
that the drop out is not too bad but we
are<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.540> rebound<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.989> into<00:03:02.319> space<00:03:02.590> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
are going to rebound that into space a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.470 
are going to rebound that into space a
little<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.890> you're<00:03:06.069> bending<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.730> make

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
little bit when you're bending this make

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660 
little bit when you're bending this make
sure<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.780> leave<00:03:08.020> your<00:03:08.260> derailleur<00:03:08.650> bolt<00:03:09.400> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
sure you leave your derailleur bolt in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.130 
sure you leave your derailleur bolt in
there<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.390> don't<00:03:10.840> elongate<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.840> hole

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
there so you don't elongate the the hole

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.699 
there so you don't elongate the the hole
and<00:03:14.580> screw<00:03:15.580> up<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.910> threads<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.590> us

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
and screw up the threads you can see us

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.930 
and screw up the threads you can see us
she's<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> little<00:03:18.160> bit<00:03:20.430> cocked<00:03:21.430> over<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.819> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
she's a little bit cocked over to the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.420 
she's a little bit cocked over to the
side<00:03:22.260> we'll<00:03:23.260> probably<00:03:23.440> have<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.799> rebind<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
side we'll probably have to rebind it a

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.990 
side we'll probably have to rebind it a
little<00:03:24.640> bit<00:03:24.819> more<00:03:25.060> down<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.840> road<00:03:26.049> here<00:03:26.350> but

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.839 

it's<00:03:31.000> pretty<00:03:31.330> soft<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:32.230> little<00:03:32.890> bit<00:03:33.519> there's<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
it's pretty soft a little bit there's a

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.170 
it's pretty soft a little bit there's a
lot<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.599> go<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.810> other<00:03:35.019> way<00:03:35.879> try<00:03:36.879> to<00:03:36.909> line<00:03:37.150> it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
lot it's go the other way try to line it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.949 
lot it's go the other way try to line it
up<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.690> little<00:03:37.900> bit<00:03:42.629> all<00:03:43.629> right<00:03:43.750> that

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
up here a little bit all right that

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.100 
up here a little bit all right that
doesn't<00:03:44.140> look<00:03:44.290> too<00:03:44.349> bad

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.140 

all<00:03:50.110> right<00:03:50.230> still<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.400> new<00:03:51.579> one<00:03:51.760> looks<00:03:51.940> a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
all right still the new one looks a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.479 
all right still the new one looks a
little<00:03:52.180> Stovall<00:03:52.900> ran<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:54.069> there<00:03:54.340> it's

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
little Stovall ran for there it's

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.550 
little Stovall ran for there it's
not<00:03:54.640> straight<00:03:54.940> up<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.239> down<00:03:55.269> but<00:03:55.599> we'll<00:03:55.780> we'll

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
not straight up and down but we'll we'll

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.850 
not straight up and down but we'll we'll
cover<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.040> when<00:03:57.250> we<00:03:57.370> get<00:03:57.810> we'll<00:03:58.810> tweak<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
cover that when we get we'll tweak and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.740 
cover that when we get we'll tweak and
rebend<00:04:00.280> us<00:04:00.489> when<00:04:00.760> we<00:04:00.849> get<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> wheel<00:04:01.239> back<00:04:01.510> in

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
rebend us when we get the wheel back in

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.059 
rebend us when we get the wheel back in
and<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:01.959> see<00:04:02.109> how<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.290> rest<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.890> a

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
and we see how the rest of it is a

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.740 
and we see how the rest of it is a
situation<00:04:03.640> like<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:04.329> where<00:04:04.569> that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
situation like this where that

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.589 
situation like this where that
derailleur<00:04:05.290> took<00:04:05.650> such<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.400> beatin<00:04:06.910> let's<00:04:07.420> take

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
derailleur took such a beatin let's take

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.740 
derailleur took such a beatin let's take
a<00:04:07.629> look<00:04:07.870> at<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.049> chain<00:04:09.239> slowly<00:04:10.239> pedal<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:12.750> see

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
a look at that chain slowly pedal to see

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.120 
a look at that chain slowly pedal to see
if<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.959> chain<00:04:14.230> is<00:04:14.260> straight<00:04:16.229> if<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.500> got<00:04:17.709> bent

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
if the chain is straight if it got bent

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.890 
if the chain is straight if it got bent
at<00:04:18.310> all

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.450 

doesn't<00:04:27.680> look<00:04:27.740> too<00:04:27.800> bad<00:04:29.320> okay<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.380> instead<00:04:31.190> of

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
doesn't look too bad okay so instead of

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.210 
doesn't look too bad okay so instead of
breaking<00:04:31.699> my<00:04:32.000> chain<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.810> and

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
to be up here so when I derailleur has a

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.550 
to be up here so when I derailleur has a
stop<00:06:35.230> and<00:06:35.500> it<00:06:35.590> doesn't<00:06:35.890> go<00:06:36.040> shifting<00:06:36.580> into<00:06:37.000> the

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
stop and it doesn't go shifting into the

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.780 
stop and it doesn't go shifting into the
wheel<00:06:38.560> again<00:06:38.860> like<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:39.190> did<00:06:39.340> the<00:06:39.460> first<00:06:39.610> time

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
wheel again like it did the first time

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.610 
wheel again like it did the first time
why<00:06:40.150> did<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:40.450> do<00:06:40.570> it<00:06:40.690> the<00:06:40.780> first<00:06:40.960> time<00:06:41.140> the<00:06:41.440> bike

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
why did it do it the first time the bike

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.610 
why did it do it the first time the bike
fell<00:06:41.920> over<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:42.820> bent<00:06:43.300> this<00:06:43.600> so<00:06:43.990> then<00:06:44.170> the<00:06:44.320> stops

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
fell over it bent this so then the stops

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.740 
fell over it bent this so then the stops
are<00:06:44.860> negated<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.460> then<00:06:46.030> hold<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.420> rail<00:06:46.570> it

are negated and then hold the rail it

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.480 
are negated and then hold the rail it
went<00:06:46.900> brick<00:06:47.170> that<00:06:47.530> she<00:06:47.710> shifted<00:06:48.070> it<00:06:48.160> right<00:06:48.310> in

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
went brick that she shifted it right in

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.420 
went brick that she shifted it right in
and<00:06:48.670> then<00:06:48.730> she<00:06:49.360> muscled<00:06:50.230> it<00:06:50.290> right<00:06:50.470> around<00:06:50.590> now

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
and then she muscled it right around now
