Hey guys, Bartek here. 

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:11.952
In today's tutorial, I'll teach you Fake Columns trick :)

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:18.032
Of course, it would be much easier for you to 
 learn it when you can juggle normal Columns.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.162
You can hold the ball like this.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:30.979
You can also use my tutorials to learn other tricks. Annotations on both sides.

00:00:34.537 --> 00:00:42.959
Take two balls to one hand. Throw them alternately side by side. 
 Do all exercises on both hands till you feel comfortable.

00:00:53.688 --> 00:01:01.234
Take one ball to each hand. Throw one of them up to head level 
 and copy the movement of the first ball holding the second one.

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:17.027
Take three balls. Throw the first one (the middle one), then do the 
 same thing as is 2nd step - throw and fake throw. 

00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:33.447
Add a next middle-ball throw to the 3rd step. Take a look.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:55.250
After middle-ball-throw add next "throw and fake throw", etc.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:12.940
One, two, three, four..

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.540
Watch till the end. Have fun learning it :)

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:17.940
