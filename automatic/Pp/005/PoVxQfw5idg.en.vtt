think he has like 76 dribbling which is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
think he has like 76 dribbling which is
really<00:01:21.600> high<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> bronze<00:01:22.710> player<00:01:22.920> guys<00:01:23.130> he

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
bother
even<00:01:36.780> taking<00:01:37.110> finish<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.770> surprisingly<00:01:38.400> even

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.370 
though he has a lot of curve in his
in-game<00:01:40.799> stats<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.610> still<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.930> bad

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
in-game stats it still is really bad

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
quite unreliable in the box sometimes

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.709 
quite unreliable in the box sometimes
