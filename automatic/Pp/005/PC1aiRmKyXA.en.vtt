00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 franchises were declining staying in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 oblivion and simply closing leaving 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.399
 the good memories of feeling a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.829

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 and after almost five years of absence 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.120
 of this type of video game against 24 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.830
 we are bending energies and emotion 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.460
 of playing live music with 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.410
 your friends 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.910
 this is what the ceo of harmonix says 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.010
 steve jean-jacques through a 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.750
 press release we want to focus 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.790
 in the experience of our fans 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.990
 love allows us to evolve in a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.760
 set game so 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 meaningful that we can not wait 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.960
 to share with everyone to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 later this year harmonix promises more 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 details of the game in May of this year 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.660
 at the moment it is announced that it will have 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.580
 downloadable material the town includes 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.710
 more than 2,000 songs of at least 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.050
 500 artists and they will do everything possible 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.209
 so that the old instruments are 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.160
 fully compatible so if you have 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.860
 its instruments accumulating dust this 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.620
 year will you have these use again and you played 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.959
 rothbart which die your favorite subject 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.569
 in gringolandia is recording period 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.150
 and as such this is an expected festival of 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.790
 graduation where everyone craves to go with and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.819
 they know the couple of their dreams but what 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.040
 happens if that girl of your dreams is miley 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.690
 cyrus and well that's what this guy wants 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.150
 Canadian boy who wants to get that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.129
 miley cyrus accompany her to their wickedness and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.690
 produced so it 's fine you know it by 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.459
 what but it will teach us how to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.870
 convince our favorite artist that 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.730
 they accompany us to our party 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.530
 graduation but you have to compensate that 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.970
 he is not a totally interesting person 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.400
 and for that you have to ask him 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.870
 best friends or friends speak well of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.700

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.099
 impress what better than your friends you 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 They fill with praise and qualities second 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.019
 show that they share the same tastes 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.470
 in this case the one of miley cyrus is a 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.470
 working 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.600
 and finally prove in a way not 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.430
 fight the permit that can be your 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 admiration for her even demonstrating 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.320
 that you admire his entire career since 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.980
 beginning of this and that more tests 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.240
 transformation of this 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 and good today andrew has not 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.770
