quick video on these two new Mora
bushcraft<00:00:07.500> tactical<00:00:08.220> knives<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.580> just<00:00:08.790> head

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
bushcraft tactical knives we just head

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.089 
bushcraft tactical knives we just head
in<00:00:09.059> get<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.870> Morris<00:00:10.170> books<00:00:10.380> quite<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> while<00:00:10.889> now

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
in get on Morris books quite a while now

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.200 
in get on Morris books quite a while now
and<00:00:11.130> they've<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.370> taken<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:11.910> while<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and they've just taken a little while to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.270 
and they've just taken a little while to
get<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> bit<00:00:12.480> stuck<00:00:12.690> out<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> quick

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
get a bit stuck out so I do a quick

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.599 
get a bit stuck out so I do a quick
video<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:15.080> so<00:00:16.080> these<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.430> base

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
video here so these are the the base

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.160 
video here so these are the the base
essentially<00:00:18.300> they're<00:00:18.449> similar<00:00:18.660> knives<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
essentially they're similar knives to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800 
essentially they're similar knives to
the<00:00:19.289> bushcraft<00:00:19.890> black<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.730> terms<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> the

know there's still ground this spine for
you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> fire<00:00:37.380> steel<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:39.000> they've

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you can use a fire steel but they've

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
you can use a fire steel but they've
used<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> sandbag<00:00:39.809> steel<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.140> opposed<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> the

used the sandbag steel as opposed to the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.090 
used the sandbag steel as opposed to the
carbon<00:00:42.230> excellent<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.410> outdoor<00:00:43.890> knife

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
carbon excellent you know outdoor knife

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.680 
carbon excellent you know outdoor knife
you<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.520> been<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:44.910> popular<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> bushcraft

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you know been very popular the bushcraft

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
you know been very popular the bushcraft
blank<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.309> big<00:00:47.460> difference

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
blank but then the other big difference

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
blank but then the other big difference
is<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> sheathing<00:00:48.539> system<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is really is the sheathing system so you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.110 
is really is the sheathing system so you
have<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> original<00:00:49.950> polypropylene<00:00:50.610> sheath

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
have the original polypropylene sheath

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240 
have the original polypropylene sheath
here<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.899> they've<00:00:51.989> added<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> nylon<00:00:52.800> carriage

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
here but they've added a nylon carriage

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
here but they've added a nylon carriage
to<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.410> means<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> can

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to it and that basically means you can

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
to it and that basically means you can
you<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.129> use<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> MOLLE<00:00:56.820> system<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you now use it with a MOLLE system you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
you now use it with a MOLLE system you
can<00:00:57.600> belt<00:00:57.809> mount<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.620> lash<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
can belt mount it you can lash it on it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
can belt mount it you can lash it on it
gives<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> flexibility<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:02.100> terms

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
gives you a lot of flexibility in terms

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.789 
gives you a lot of flexibility in terms
of<00:01:02.460> how<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> sheath<00:01:03.530> knife<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of how you can use the sheath knife just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
of how you can use the sheath knife just
sits<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.790> normal<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.330> an

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sits here in there as normal and is an

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.330 
sits here in there as normal and is an
elasticated<00:01:06.990> ring<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> snaps<00:01:07.799> over<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> top

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
elasticated ring that snaps over the top

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.120 
elasticated ring that snaps over the top
there<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> roll

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
there I don't know they're going to roll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.649 
there I don't know they're going to roll
this<00:01:11.310> system<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.820> other<00:01:12.119> knives<00:01:12.330> but

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this system out to other knives but

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.710 
this system out to other knives but
maybe<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.590> trying<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.369> two

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
maybe they're just trying on these two

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
maybe they're just trying on these two
this<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> serrated<00:01:16.860> version<00:01:17.400> exactly

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this one is the serrated version exactly

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
this one is the serrated version exactly
the<00:01:18.119> same<00:01:18.500> terms<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.650> dimensions<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the same terms of dimensions you just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.920 
the same terms of dimensions you just
get<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.700> inch<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> quarter<00:01:21.150> serrations

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
get an inch and a quarter serrations

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
get an inch and a quarter serrations
here<00:01:22.189> but<00:01:23.189> very<00:01:23.369> good<00:01:23.490> outdoor<00:01:23.640> knife<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
here but very good outdoor knife you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740 
here but very good outdoor knife you
know<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.630> great<00:01:25.350> utility<00:01:25.770> knife<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:27.540> think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
know a great utility knife and I think

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030 
know a great utility knife and I think
the<00:01:27.810> sheathing<00:01:28.049> system<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.619> makes<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> bit

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the sheathing system just makes it a bit

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
the sheathing system just makes it a bit
more<00:01:29.130> flexible<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> lots<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
more flexible you know to lots of

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.179 
more flexible you know to lots of
different<00:01:30.869> options<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> carry<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
different options in a way you carry it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.690 
different options in a way you carry it
so<00:01:32.509> say<00:01:33.509> more<00:01:33.750> equality<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> sampling

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so say more equality so the sampling

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
so say more equality so the sampling
steels<00:01:36.710> 58<00:01:37.710> HRC<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.610> good<00:01:38.850> hedge<00:01:39.000> holding<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
steels 58 HRC so good hedge holding and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.550
