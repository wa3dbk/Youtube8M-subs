close-ups<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.380> picked<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.010> video<00:00:48.309> because

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
close-ups I picked this video because

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.889 
close-ups I picked this video because
there's<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.880> ton<00:00:49.090> of<00:00:49.120> different<00:00:49.300> colors<00:00:49.690> going

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
there's a ton of different colors going

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.930 
there's a ton of different colors going
on<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:51.010> thought<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.370> gave<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.550> pretty<00:00:51.760> good

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
on and I thought it gave a pretty good

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.360 
on and I thought it gave a pretty good
representation<00:00:52.360> of<00:00:53.020> what<00:00:53.079> each<00:00:53.530> screen<00:00:54.010> is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
representation of what each screen is

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.110 
representation of what each screen is
capable<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.239> so<00:00:55.989> let's<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:57.730> these<00:00:57.880> all

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
capable of so let's get these all

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.639 
capable of so let's get these all
landscape<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:04.780> what<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.049> can<00:01:05.199> do<00:01:05.409> here

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
landscape and see what we can do here

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:15.810 
landscape and see what we can do here
alright<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:06.670> play<00:01:06.909> play<00:01:07.329> and<00:01:08.130> play

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:24.350 

all<00:01:16.420> right<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.670> droid<00:01:18.909> razr

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.840 

okay<00:01:25.610> Galaxy<00:01:26.610> Nexus<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.400> HTC

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
okay Galaxy Nexus and here is the HTC

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
okay Galaxy Nexus and here is the HTC
Rezound<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:39.030> let<00:01:39.330> this<00:01:39.510> video<00:01:39.810> roll

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
Rezound and which let this video roll

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
Rezound and which let this video roll
out<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.590> only<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> minute<00:01:41.070> long<00:01:41.340> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
out it's only about a minute long you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.280 
out it's only about a minute long you
can<00:01:42.330> sort<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.750> different<00:01:42.990> color

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
can sort of get different color

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.469 
can sort of get different color
comparisons<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:47.479> resolutions

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
comparisons going on there resolutions

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.180 
comparisons going on there resolutions
definitely<00:01:48.930> noticeable<00:01:49.320> between<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
definitely noticeable between the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:02:04.730 
definitely noticeable between the
resound<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.910> droid<00:01:51.330> razr

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 

obviously<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> Galaxy<00:02:05.970> Nexus<00:02:06.060> video<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
obviously the Galaxy Nexus video is a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
obviously the Galaxy Nexus video is a
little<00:02:07.740> behind<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.599> you'll<00:02:09.750> notice

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
little behind so one thing you'll notice

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.320 
little behind so one thing you'll notice
obviously<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> bat<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
obviously right off the bat is that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
obviously right off the bat is that
extra<00:02:12.690> extension<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.410> screen<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
didn't mention that alright so that's

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.020 
didn't mention that alright so that's
just<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.540> quick<00:02:36.569> comparison<00:02:37.760> I'm<00:02:38.760> not<00:02:38.880> going

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
just a quick comparison I'm not going

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
just a quick comparison I'm not going
really<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.360> dive<00:02:39.569> into<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.980> think

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
really going to dive into what I think

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.090 
really going to dive into what I think
looks<00:02:41.519> better<00:02:41.819> um<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.600> far<00:02:43.049> as<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.470> viewing

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
looks better um as far as the viewing

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.920 
looks better um as far as the viewing

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410

bit more than super lcds do so watching

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
bit more than super lcds do so watching
it<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.640> personally<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.239> seems<00:03:21.570> like<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.560> get

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it just personally it seems like you get

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.410 
it just personally it seems like you get
a<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.890> more<00:03:23.040> vibrant<00:03:23.549> colors<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.209> of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
a little more vibrant colors out of

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.470 
a little more vibrant colors out of
these<00:03:24.690> two<00:03:24.959> devices<00:03:25.230> over<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.890> resound<00:03:26.480> but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
these two devices over the resound but

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.360 
these two devices over the resound but
that's<00:03:27.630> obviously<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:28.380> preference<00:03:28.920> as<00:03:29.070> far<00:03:29.250> as

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
that's obviously a preference as far as

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
that's obviously a preference as far as
how<00:03:29.489> you're<00:03:29.640> high<00:03:29.850> what<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> likes<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.109> see

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
how you're high what your I likes to see

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.349 
how you're high what your I likes to see
so<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.590> might<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> pop<00:03:32.489> somebody<00:03:33.209> else

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
so I might like a pop somebody else

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.259 
so I might like a pop somebody else
might<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.140> subtle<00:03:34.500> colors<00:03:34.890> or<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.400> sort

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
might like the subtle colors or the sort

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.000 
might like the subtle colors or the sort
of<00:03:36.359> more<00:03:36.540> real<00:03:36.870> colors<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> resound

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
of more real colors that the resound
