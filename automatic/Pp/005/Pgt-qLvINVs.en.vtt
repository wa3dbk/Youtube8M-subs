00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello my name is thiago and I want to do 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 this brief presentation to convince 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.450
 You never buy anything else in Brazil. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.700
 I get pissed off with the absurd prices that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.690
 the stores charge us Brazilians 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.779
 does not make the slightest sense to pay 400 500 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 real by a nike sneaker or 300 reais 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 and an adidas jacket I already had the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.990
 privilege of going to the United States and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.099
 I was scared of the difference 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.929
 prices 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.800
 For example, I bought a nike sneaker. 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.780
 for $ 40 that maria to 80 Reals and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 when I arrived in Brazil 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 I saw this same shoe being sold at 400 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 five times more expensive than 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 worse 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 I bought these sneakers in an outlet that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.559
 are those famous settlement shops 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.530
 or while in the United States this 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.440
 model was already outdated was out 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 of official stores in Brazil was sold 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.290
 as if it were the brand's latest news 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.880
 What a real lie. 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.510
 unfortunately this is the reality here in the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 Brazil 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.689
 the Brazilian only fucks because he gets bad 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 and have to pay much more for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.860
 almost everything 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.520
 so the best way to spend your 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.189
 money and make it pay more 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.439
 important these clothing accessories 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.750
 directly from overseas companies 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 some should think poxa but this is not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 very difficult that I see that people 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.680
 they think that import business a lot 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 complicated that involves a lot of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.439
 bureaucracy 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 but the truth is that the whole process is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.450
 as simple as buying at any 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.430
 website in brazil many purchases from 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 intermediaries for example in the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.259
 free in virtual stores because they know 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.860
 someone you trust or you do not know 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.470
 English well know that you are paying 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.090
 much more expensive for the same product 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 because they put a profit margin 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.000
 high on this resale 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.759
 in summary it is not worth buying these 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.530
 sellers and the best deal is to import 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.840
 directly from brands 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.830
 There are a few who are there 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.410
 requirements for this is first 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 already have basic English to the minimum 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.570

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 companies and search jacket t-shirt 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.570
 shoes and closing and closing the order is 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980
 after that you need to have a 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.350
 international credit 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.210
 but today most of the cards 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.730
 already issued international is then 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.970
 This is no big barrier. 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.560
