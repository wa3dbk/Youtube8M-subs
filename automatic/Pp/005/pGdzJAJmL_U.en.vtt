inner box that goes inside the main box

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.640 
inner box that goes inside the main box
it<00:00:29.039> comes<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.140> bag<00:00:31.349> full

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
be upgrading to sleep cables just
depending<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.059> feel<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.390> spending

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
depending on how I feel about spending

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.990 
depending on how I feel about spending
that<00:00:52.260> much<00:00:52.440> money<00:00:54.020> but<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.350> definitely<00:00:56.000> like

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that much money but I definitely like

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.310 
that much money but I definitely like
the<00:00:57.030> fact<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.600> black<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:57.960> that's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the fact that they are black so that's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.760 
the fact that they are black so that's
pretty<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.920> mean<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.550> good<00:00:59.820> enough<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.090> now

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
pretty I mean that's good enough for now

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.179 
pretty I mean that's good enough for now
for<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.129> least<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.860> power

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
for me at least so and I and this power

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.010 
for me at least so and I and this power
supply<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.489> fully<00:01:05.790> modular<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
supply is fully modular which is the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
supply is fully modular which is the
reason<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:09.229> I'm<00:01:10.430> my<00:01:11.430> new<00:01:11.580> build<00:01:11.820> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reason I got it I'm my new build is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.899 
reason I got it I'm my new build is
going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.680> bitfenix<00:01:13.680> prodigy<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.880> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to be in bitfenix prodigy and so I

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
going to be in bitfenix prodigy and so I
didn't<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> excess<00:01:15.869> cables<00:01:16.790> all

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
didn't want to have excess cables all

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
didn't want to have excess cables all
over<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> place<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.530> little

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
over the place I want to use as little

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.510 
over the place I want to use as little
as<00:01:19.860> possible<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.740> power<00:01:22.950> supply<00:01:23.250> comes<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
as possible so the power supply comes in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.990 
as possible so the power supply comes in
own<00:01:26.630> course<00:01:27.630> airbag<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.770> last<00:01:29.280> corsair<00:01:29.729> power

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
own course airbag the last corsair power

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990 
own course airbag the last corsair power
supply<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.299> had<00:01:31.159> i'll<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> check<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.729> i

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
supply i had i'll have to check but i

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
supply i had i'll have to check but i
think<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> came<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.869> better<00:01:34.110> bag<00:01:35.100> even

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
think it came in a better bag even

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.600 
think it came in a better bag even
though<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.479> bag<00:01:36.689> doesn't<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.200> matter<00:01:37.610> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
though the bag doesn't really matter I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
though the bag doesn't really matter I
mean<00:01:39.180> cost<00:01:39.360> wise<00:01:39.659> yeah<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.409> extra

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
mean cost wise yeah that's just an extra

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210 
mean cost wise yeah that's just an extra
little<00:01:41.329> nice<00:01:42.329> thing<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:42.960> did<00:01:43.189> but<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
little nice thing that they did but I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.950 
little nice thing that they did but I
think<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.700> last<00:01:44.909> power<00:01:45.149> supply<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.720> was

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
think my last power supply which was

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
think my last power supply which was
cheaper<00:01:46.409> than<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:47.130> actually<00:01:47.460> had<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
cheaper than this I'm actually had a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.139 
cheaper than this I'm actually had a
nicer<00:01:48.119> bag<00:01:48.329> yeah<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
nicer bag yeah i think it was like a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.770 
nicer bag yeah i think it was like a
microfiber<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> here's<00:01:54.509> power

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
microfiber or something so here's power

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.980 
microfiber or something so here's power
supply<00:01:55.110> itself<00:01:56.360> guess<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.570> upside<00:01:57.869> down

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
supply itself guess that's upside down

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
supply itself guess that's upside down
for<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.689> power<00:02:00.930> supply<00:02:01.320> also<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
for you so this power supply also is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.359 
for you so this power supply also is
extremely<00:02:03.119> quiet<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> fan<00:02:04.560> only<00:02:04.920> turns<00:02:05.159> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
extremely quiet the fan only turns on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.210 
extremely quiet the fan only turns on
when<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.640> needs<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.799> most<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> time

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
when it needs to so at most of the time

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.320 
when it needs to so at most of the time
when<00:02:08.340> you're<00:02:08.550> browsing<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> internet<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
when you're browsing the internet and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.040 
when you're browsing the internet and
things<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.440> fan<00:02:11.280> won't<00:02:11.520> even<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:12.599> powered<00:02:12.930> on

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
things the fan won't even be powered on

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.610 
things the fan won't even be powered on
which<00:02:13.410> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
which is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.250 
which is
awesome<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.519> going<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.480> very

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
awesome because I'm going for a very

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.210 
awesome because I'm going for a very
silent<00:02:16.940> build<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> here's<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.920> various

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
silent build so here's all the various

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.509 
silent build so here's all the various
connectors<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> fan<00:02:22.890> control<00:02:23.280> switch

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
connectors this is a fan control switch

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.690 
connectors this is a fan control switch
I<00:02:23.819> don't<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.470> specs<00:02:26.159> on<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.400> yet

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
I don't know all of that specs on it yet

I don't know all of that specs on it yet
of<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:27.659> hybrid<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.170> normal<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:29.390> I'll<00:02:30.390> look

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
of what hybrid and normal do I'll look

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.830 
of what hybrid and normal do I'll look
into<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.690> quick

whole<00:02:38.340> lot<00:02:38.519> more<00:02:39.260> components<00:02:40.260> coming<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
whole lot more components coming the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.460 
whole lot more components coming the
case<00:02:41.849> should<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.239> here<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.690> couple<00:02:42.720> days<00:02:43.079> and
