first game from light to darkness and in

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.620 
first game from light to darkness and in
this<00:00:34.070> game<00:00:34.280> we<00:00:34.399> go<00:00:34.520> from<00:00:34.700> dark<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:35.059> very<00:00:35.540> very

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
this game we go from dark to very very

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.479 
this game we go from dark to very very
dark<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.530> much<00:00:36.649> more<00:00:36.829> cruel<00:00:37.100> at<00:00:37.250> our

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
dark and it's a much more cruel at our

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.209 
dark and it's a much more cruel at our
much<00:00:37.700> darker<00:00:38.030> tail<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:38.989> think<00:00:39.260> that<00:00:39.500> you

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
much darker tail and I think that you

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.440 
much darker tail and I think that you
know<00:00:40.340> following<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.790> character<00:00:41.149> that<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:41.300> can

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
know following a character that you can

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.600 
know following a character that you can
identify<00:00:41.540> was<00:00:42.140> really<00:00:42.500> important<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.489> we

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
identify was really important so we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.670 
identify was really important so we
wanted<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:43.910> have<00:00:44.090> a<00:00:44.149> guy<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.660> people<00:00:44.960> really

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
wanted to have a guy that people really

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.920 
wanted to have a guy that people really
saw<00:00:45.980> re<00:00:46.399> felt<00:00:46.700> for<00:00:46.910> him<00:00:47.030> they<00:00:47.329> understood<00:00:47.719> how

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
saw re felt for him they understood how

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.750 
saw re felt for him they understood how
he<00:00:47.989> got<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:48.350> place<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:49.399> think<00:00:49.489> in

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
he got to that place and so I think in

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.459 
he got to that place and so I think in
many<00:00:49.850> ways<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.120> Drake<00:00:50.450> isn't<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.870> more<00:00:51.079> human

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
many ways a Drake isn't is more human

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.619 
many ways a Drake isn't is more human

and he's looking to settle some scores
we<00:01:22.369> specifically<00:01:22.849> designed<00:01:23.240> Dracula<00:01:23.719> as<00:01:23.899> a

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
we specifically designed Dracula as a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:25.300 
we specifically designed Dracula as a
character<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.859> people<00:01:25.099> could<00:01:25.219> identify

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
character that people could identify

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.429 
character that people could identify
with<00:01:25.880> our<00:01:25.909> early<00:01:26.359> designs<00:01:26.689> of<00:01:26.840> Dracula<00:01:27.229> much

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
with our early designs of Dracula much

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.620 
with our early designs of Dracula much
more<00:01:27.619> kind<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.369> very<00:01:28.759> powerful<00:01:28.939> character

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
more kind of a very powerful character

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.839 
more kind of a very powerful character
but<00:01:29.959> we<00:01:30.049> wanted<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.409> give<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:31.039> tough<00:01:31.609> throw<00:01:31.759> back

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
but we wanted to give a tough throw back

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:33.219 
but we wanted to give a tough throw back
to<00:01:32.029> what<00:01:32.209> happy<00:01:32.419> looks<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.899> original<00:01:32.990> game

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
to what happy looks in the original game

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.679 
to what happy looks in the original game
so<00:01:33.619> when<00:01:33.829> making<00:01:34.099> a<00:01:34.279> game<00:01:34.459> you<00:01:35.299> need<00:01:35.419> to<00:01:35.569> be

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
so when making a game you need to be

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.719 
so when making a game you need to be
careful<00:01:36.079> about<00:01:36.439> designing<00:01:37.099> characters

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
careful about designing characters

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.279 
careful about designing characters
especially<00:01:37.880> main<00:01:38.419> character<00:01:38.840> specially

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
was he's made a Dracula really dangerous

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
and you can sense the evil we can sense

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.660 
and you can sense the evil we can sense
the<00:02:38.660> kind<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.290> predatory<00:02:39.680> nature<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the kind of predatory nature of the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.580 
the kind of predatory nature of the
character<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.270> wasn't<00:02:41.900> there<00:02:42.020> before<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.530> I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
character that wasn't there before and I

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.810 
character that wasn't there before and I
think<00:02:42.770> it<00:02:42.860> really<00:02:42.890> comes<00:02:43.190> across<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.670> that's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
think it really comes across and that's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.760 
think it really comes across and that's
something<00:02:44.000> he<00:02:44.240> was<00:02:44.390> very<00:02:44.600> certain<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.620> he

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
something he was very certain that he

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.830 
something he was very certain that he
wanted<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.160> do<00:02:46.340> on<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> voice<00:02:47.270> out<00:02:47.450> section

wanted to do on the voice out section

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.510 
wanted to do on the voice out section
because<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:48.290> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.680> wanted<00:02:48.890> him<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.130> imitate

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
because we kind of wanted him to imitate
