00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.759
 the cellar on into we called it to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 his into what means the wind in Sardinian 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.060
 as all these hills are 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.060
 exposed to the wind 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.100
 my family consists of my wife 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.910
 lucia da valeria from roberta and da nicola 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 everyone in the family to his role e 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.300
 to his responsibilities 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.379
 the added value of a company 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.089
 family and the passion they put into it 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.300
 inside the company 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.329
 I think it is an added value that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 no manager could give if you come 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.409
 in the cellar in that in the period of the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.960
 harvest 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.600
 we are active firsthand is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.550
 important to me for all my 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.009
 family being in the foreground 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.479
 also at that time the origins 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.990
 of our family were from 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.820
 farmers then traders and today 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.380
 I had the satisfaction of returning 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 originally I didn't have it 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.490
 a few rows of wine mainly 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.340
 red grapes and made a wine a little way 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.620
 his without observing that much 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.960
 technical but 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.940
 only what his father also 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.350
 he had taught the winemaker's work 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.690
 fundamental because he who 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.570
 gives us guidelines on when to cut 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.970
 the grapes when they are ready 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.320
 is that then does all the work of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.190
 wine preparation wines on entu 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 they are an expression of the passion for the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.280
 work of the pilloni family in three 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 words I like to summarize what 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 the company on into passion for work 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.550
 so the family pylons that day 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.480
 after day he is creating a beautiful one 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.880
 wine reality in the territory 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.300
 tradition therefore traditional vines 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.100
 ilbo is worth the vermentino mainly and 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.350
 innovation as innovation 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.140
 I like that the whole team of his 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.380
 entity can talk about great wine 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.170
 wine in the durability of the wine 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.810
 in time in the pleasantness and in the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.810
 passion for the vineyard 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.710
 Sardinia is an ancient land 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.680
 so much so that within ours 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.610
 land there is a time ge going back to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.630
 about three thousand years ago 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:13.350
 I also like to think or dream 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.860
 that 3000 does, however, there were gods 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.360
 vines is that the same wind was blowing 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.360
 blowing now
