00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.640 
on or sure to eat like a home-cooked
meal<00:02:42.760> would<00:02:43.150> be<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> meal<00:02:43.600> by<00:02:43.810> her<00:02:44.020> husband<00:02:44.440> like

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
know so he's like the mother in a way

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.710 
know so he's like the mother in a way
and<00:02:50.560> like<00:02:50.740> said<00:02:51.220> he's<00:02:51.490> like<00:02:51.640> for<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.570> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
and like said he's like for in this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.080 
and like said he's like for in this
article<00:02:52.990> they're<00:02:53.230> saying<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.890> know<00:02:54.010> she

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
article they're saying that you know she

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.780 
article they're saying that you know she
works<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.360> lot<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.830> I<00:02:56.950> guess<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.760> that

works a lot and then I guess with that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
works a lot and then I guess with that
reasoning<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.720> maybe<00:02:58.959> she<00:02:59.170> doesn't<00:02:59.320> have

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
reasoning that maybe she doesn't have

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.530 
reasoning that maybe she doesn't have
