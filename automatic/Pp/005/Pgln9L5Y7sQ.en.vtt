00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.710 
hello everyone and welcome to this
week's<00:00:02.100> video<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.970> I'll<00:00:03.210> be<00:00:03.240> explaining

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
week's video today I'll be explaining

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.320 
week's video today I'll be explaining
electronic<00:00:04.589> throttle<00:00:04.799> control<00:00:04.980> or<00:00:05.580> drive<00:00:06.299> by

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
electronic throttle control or drive by

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.870 
electronic throttle control or drive by
a<00:00:06.540> wire<00:00:06.839> now<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.770> modern<00:00:07.950> vehicles<00:00:08.550> pretty

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
a wire now in modern vehicles pretty

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.370 
a wire now in modern vehicles pretty
much<00:00:09.030> everything<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> moving<00:00:09.960> towards

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
much everything is moving towards

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.589 
much everything is moving towards
electronic<00:00:10.889> control<00:00:11.490> rather<00:00:11.820> than<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.360> sort

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
electronic control rather than some sort

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.539 
electronic control rather than some sort
of<00:00:12.630> mechanical<00:00:12.809> control<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
of mechanical control this is just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.670 
of mechanical control this is just
another<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> those<00:00:15.150> processes<00:00:16.020> that's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
another one of those processes that's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.580 
another one of those processes that's
changing<00:00:17.220> over<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.750> gas<00:00:18.930> pedal<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.410> no

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
changing over so your gas pedal is no

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
changing over so your gas pedal is no
longer<00:00:19.800> controlling<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.520> cable<00:00:20.939> rather<00:00:21.480> it's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
longer controlling a cable rather it's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.279 
longer controlling a cable rather it's
just<00:00:21.779> using<00:00:22.289> sensors<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.430> tell<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:24.480> ECU<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
just using sensors to tell your ECU to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560 
just using sensors to tell your ECU to
manage<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.800> much<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.310> open<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.640> throttle<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
manage how much to open the throttle so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.359 
manage how much to open the throttle so
let's<00:00:27.779> take<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.680> works<00:00:28.949> song

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
let's take a look at how this works song

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.150 
let's take a look at how this works song
it's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> pretty<00:00:29.939> simple<00:00:30.210> system<00:00:31.130> you've<00:00:32.130> got

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
it's a pretty simple system you've got

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490 
it's a pretty simple system you've got
your<00:00:32.460> gas<00:00:32.610> pedal<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.899> regular

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
your gas pedal just like in a regular

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.920 
your gas pedal just like in a regular
car<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.399> instead<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.000> gas<00:00:36.239> pedal<00:00:36.719> being

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
car but instead of this gas pedal being

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.500 
car but instead of this gas pedal being
connected<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.739> cable<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:39.030> connected<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
connected to a cable it is connected to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
connected to a cable it is connected to
a<00:00:39.690> position<00:00:40.020> sensor<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.250> wired<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a position sensor which is wired to the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.869 
a position sensor which is wired to the
engine<00:00:42.360> control<00:00:42.540> module<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.399> position

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
engine control module so this position

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
engine control module so this position
sensor<00:00:45.300> senses<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.050> much<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.469> press<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sensor senses how much you press in the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.889 
sensor senses how much you press in the
gas<00:00:47.190> pedal<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> press<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> gas

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
gas pedal when you press in the gas

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.619 
gas pedal when you press in the gas
pedal<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.250> engine<00:00:50.280> control<00:00:50.789> module<00:00:51.120> tells

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
pedal the engine control module tells

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
pedal the engine control module tells
the<00:00:51.750> motor<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.170> turn<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.190> motor<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the motor to turn and that motor is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.479 
the motor to turn and that motor is
connected<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.110> butterfly<00:00:55.920> valve<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
connected to the butterfly valve in the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
connected to the butterfly valve in the
throttle<00:00:56.820> body<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.809> haven't<00:00:58.020> watched<00:00:58.199> my

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
throttle body if you haven't watched my

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.310 
throttle body if you haven't watched my
video<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.980> traditional<00:00:59.670> gas<00:01:00.329> pedal<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> how

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
video on a traditional gas pedal and how

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
video on a traditional gas pedal and how
they<00:01:01.530> function<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.309> recommend<00:01:02.699> doing

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
they function I would recommend doing

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
they function I would recommend doing
that<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:04.019> understand<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.710> system

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that now to understand how this system

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.990 
that now to understand how this system
kind<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> works<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> anyways<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> motor<00:01:08.790> will

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
kind of works so anyways this motor will

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
kind of works so anyways this motor will
rotate<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> will<00:01:09.900> open<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.380> close<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
rotate and it will open or close this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
rotate and it will open or close this
butterfly<00:01:12.180> valve<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
butterfly valve then you're going to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
butterfly valve then you're going to
send<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.700> signal<00:01:14.820> there's<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
send that signal there's going to be a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.530 
send that signal there's going to be a
position<00:01:16.470> sensor<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.549> throttle<00:01:17.790> body<00:01:18.090> or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
position sensor of this throttle body or

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
position sensor of this throttle body or
this<00:01:19.320> butterfly<00:01:19.650> valve<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.729> go

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
this butterfly valve and that will go

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.359 
this butterfly valve and that will go
back<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> engine<00:01:22.470> control<00:01:22.619> module<00:01:22.950> part

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
back to the engine control module part

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
back to the engine control module part
of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> ECU<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:25.080> process<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of the ECU so the process that the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
of the ECU so the process that the
engine<00:01:26.400> control<00:01:26.520> module<00:01:26.820> uses<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.780> you've<00:01:28.439> got

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
engine control module uses is you've got

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.100 
engine control module uses is you've got
your<00:01:28.799> gas<00:01:28.950> pedal<00:01:29.189> position<00:01:29.729> based<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
your gas pedal position based on that it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
your gas pedal position based on that it
rotates<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> motor<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> let<00:01:32.729> off<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
rotates the motor so if you let off the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
rotates the motor so if you let off the
gas<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:33.900> rotate<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.320> motor<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
gas that will rotate the motor so that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
gas that will rotate the motor so that
this<00:01:34.979> butterfly<00:01:35.189> valve<00:01:35.700> goes<00:01:36.329> back<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> almost

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this butterfly valve goes back to almost

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.740 
this butterfly valve goes back to almost
a<00:01:37.200> closed<00:01:37.409> position<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.299> will<00:01:39.390> open<00:01:39.540> or

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
a closed position so that will open or

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
a closed position so that will open or
closer<00:01:39.990> valve<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.549> butterfly<00:01:41.939> valve<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
closer valve or your butterfly valve and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
closer valve or your butterfly valve and
then<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:43.439> check<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> sensor<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
then it will check with the sensor to

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
then it will check with the sensor to
make<00:01:44.670> sure<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> right<00:01:45.210> spot<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
make sure it's in the right spot so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.020 
make sure it's in the right spot so
you're<00:01:46.409> checking<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.159> sure<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you're checking to make sure that the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
you're checking to make sure that the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you can have problems where you might

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.319 
you can have problems where you might
like<00:01:52.110> say<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> sensor<00:01:52.799> goes<00:01:52.829> bad<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.909> can

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
like say the sensor goes bad it can

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.420 
like say the sensor goes bad it can
check<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.110> we'll<00:01:55.259> hey<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
check and know that we'll hey you know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
check and know that we'll hey you know
the<00:01:56.549> throttle<00:01:56.850> position<00:01:56.969> isn't<00:01:57.570> where<00:01:57.689> it's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the throttle position isn't where it's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.810 
the throttle position isn't where it's
supposed<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.610> check

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
supposed to be and then your check

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.950 
supposed to be and then your check
engine<00:01:59.850> light<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.390> come<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.840> know

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
engine light will come on you know

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
engine light will come on you know
you've<00:02:01.110> got<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> problem<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.270> here<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.540> an

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you've got a problem so here we have an

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
you've got a problem so here we have an
electronically<00:02:04.350> controlled<00:02:04.439> throttle<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
electronically controlled throttle and
