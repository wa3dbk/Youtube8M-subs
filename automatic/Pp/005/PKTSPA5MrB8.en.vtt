00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
I'm going to repeat the same petition

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.720 
I'm going to repeat the same petition
which<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.210> did<00:00:15.389> before<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.980> order<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> draw

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
which I did before so in order to draw

which I did before so in order to draw
this<00:00:17.850> endgame<00:00:18.300> quite<00:00:18.810> easily<00:00:19.400> blackness<00:00:20.400> play

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
this endgame quite easily blackness play

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.990 
this endgame quite easily blackness play
rather<00:00:21.930> precisely<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
rather precisely and this is the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.160 
rather precisely and this is the
philidor's<00:00:24.630> defense<00:00:25.460> just<00:00:26.460> remember<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.420> if

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
philidor's defense just remember that if

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.460 
philidor's defense just remember that if
white<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.890> F<00:00:29.189> pawn<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:30.480> say<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.869> bishop

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
white has an F pawn could say a bishop

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709 
white has an F pawn could say a bishop
pawn<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.279> works<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.329> C<00:00:33.540> pawn

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
pawn because it works to see the C pawn

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.709 
pawn because it works to see the C pawn
as<00:00:33.870> well<00:00:34.430> then<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.460> can't<00:00:35.880> rely<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.149> passive

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
as well then you can't rely on passive

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.979 
as well then you can't rely on passive
defense<00:00:37.079> by<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.000> porn<00:00:39.329> were<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
defense by the way if the porn were a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
defense by the way if the porn were a
knight<00:00:40.290> spawn<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.820> passively

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
knight spawn then you can just passively

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.860 
knight spawn then you can just passively
defend<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.559> King<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.610> g8<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
defend with your King on g8 and your

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
defend with your King on g8 and your
rook<00:00:46.110> covering<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.469> eighth-ranked<00:00:49.469> okay<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
rook covering the eighth-ranked okay so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.029 
rook covering the eighth-ranked okay so
it's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> bishop<00:00:51.629> form<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.590> defense

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's a bishop form for little defense

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.700 
it's a bishop form for little defense
how<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.640> draw<00:00:53.850> well<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.840> need<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.140> active

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
how do we draw well we need to go active

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.569 
how do we draw well we need to go active
here<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.370> crucial<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.390> checked<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.579> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here it's crucial to get checked and to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
here it's crucial to get checked and to
stop<00:00:59.940> white<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> advancing<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.649> why<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
stop white to advancing so that's why we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.479 
stop white to advancing so that's why we
play<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> position<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.619> move<00:01:04.830> rook

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
play in this position the good move rook

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.510 
play in this position the good move rook
b6<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> most<00:01:06.750> precise<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.710> must<00:01:08.010> play

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
b6 is most precise and you must play

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
b6 is most precise and you must play
this<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.080> played<00:01:10.409> erroneously<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.600> I'd

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
this if you played erroneously with I'd

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
this if you played erroneously with I'd
know<00:01:12.810> let's<00:01:13.049> say<00:01:13.260> rook<00:01:13.860> b1<00:01:14.340> well<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.939> think

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
know let's say rook b1 well then I think

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
know let's say rook b1 well then I think
King<00:01:15.450> g6<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.259> fact<00:01:16.500> winning<00:01:16.799> okay<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
King g6 is in fact winning okay so it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.399 
King g6 is in fact winning okay so it
would<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.299> six<00:01:18.570> remember<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.960> move<00:01:19.200> I'll

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
would be six remember this move I'll

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.219 
would be six remember this move I'll
repeat<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.580> b6<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.720> idea<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
repeat that for you look b6 the idea is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.240 
repeat that for you look b6 the idea is
that<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.830> cover<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.570> sixth<00:01:24.570> rank<00:01:25.040> we<00:01:26.040> could

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that we cover the sixth rank we could

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.080 
that we cover the sixth rank we could
see<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> third<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:28.220> really<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> King<00:01:29.790> cannot

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
see the third and really the King cannot

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.310 
see the third and really the King cannot
advance<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.400> checks<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.700> help<00:01:33.000> white

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
advance and checks don't help white

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
advance and checks don't help white
because<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> repeat<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.909> only<00:01:36.119> way

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
because we just repeat so the only way

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
because we just repeat so the only way
for<00:01:36.990> white<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.380> any<00:01:37.619> progress<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.220> with

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
for white to make any progress is with

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.170 
for white to make any progress is with
f6<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.470> fact<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.189> doesn't<00:01:41.729> help<00:01:41.909> him

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
f6 and in fact this doesn't help him

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
f6 and in fact this doesn't help him
because<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> must<00:01:43.259> remember<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.649> key

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
because now you must remember this key

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
because now you must remember this key
move<00:01:44.130> rook<00:01:44.759> b1<00:01:45.180> brilliant<00:01:45.930> okay<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.439> are

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
move rook b1 brilliant okay we are

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
move rook b1 brilliant okay we are
attacking<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> idea<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> simply<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
attacking and the idea is simply that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.870 
attacking and the idea is simply that
again<00:01:50.159> checking<00:01:51.119> doesn't<00:01:51.540> help<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> white

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
again checking doesn't help so white

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
again checking doesn't help so white
will<00:01:54.060> eventually<00:01:54.570> realize<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> bring

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
will eventually realize he has to bring

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.249 
will eventually realize he has to bring
his<00:01:56.100> King<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> create<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> mating<00:01:57.270> threat<00:01:57.600> but

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
his King to create a mating threat but

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
his King to create a mating threat but
now<00:01:58.950> rook<00:01:59.909> g1<00:02:00.390> check<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.219> kaboom<00:02:02.219> we've<00:02:02.640> blown

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
now rook g1 check and kaboom we've blown

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
now rook g1 check and kaboom we've blown
all<00:02:03.240> his<00:02:03.689> attack<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:04.860> okay

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
all his attack out of the water okay

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.819 
all his attack out of the water okay
simply<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.409> no<00:02:07.530> shelter

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
simply because now there's no shelter

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.639 
simply because now there's no shelter
and<00:02:08.280> he<00:02:08.340> cannot<00:02:08.700> hide<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> pawn<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.140> f5

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and he cannot hide with the pawn on f5

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.480 
and he cannot hide with the pawn on f5
hitting<00:02:11.489> could<00:02:11.640> come<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
hitting could come to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.280 
hitting could come to
at<00:02:12.580> six<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:12.970> now<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.300> porn<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.900> blocking

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
at six but now the porn is blocking

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.620 
at six but now the porn is blocking
