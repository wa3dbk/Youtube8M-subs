pieces<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:34.159> paper<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.630> way<00:01:35.899> tightly<00:01:36.590> as<00:01:36.890> you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
pieces of paper this way tightly as you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.809 
pieces of paper this way tightly as you
can<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.610> other<00:01:37.820> way<00:01:39.369> make<00:01:40.369> sure<00:01:40.399> they<00:01:40.789> are

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
can the other way make sure they are

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.870 
can the other way make sure they are
very<00:01:41.210> tight<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:45.020> if<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:45.619> do<00:01:46.069> a<00:01:46.100> bad<00:01:46.579> job<00:01:46.610> of

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
very tight and if you do a bad job of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.429 
very tight and if you do a bad job of
rolling<00:01:47.179> like<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.600> founded<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.319> press<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:50.439> band

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
rolling like I founded it press the band

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.620 
rolling like I founded it press the band
where<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.890> see<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.189> paper<00:01:52.459> bowl<00:01:52.789> against

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
where you can see the paper bowl against

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.199 
where you can see the paper bowl against
the<00:01:54.140> table<00:01:54.350> or<00:01:54.770> whatever<00:01:55.670> scraps<00:01:56.000> your

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:48.960 

and<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:31.450> always<00:02:31.720> keep<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:46.620> all<00:02:47.620> right<00:02:47.820> for<00:02:48.820> this

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
and as always keep it all right for this

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.530 
and as always keep it all right for this
second<00:02:49.870> one<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.440> need<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.800> much<00:02:51.280> shorter<00:02:51.580> than

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
second one you need it much shorter than

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:02.240 
second one you need it much shorter than
your<00:02:52.990> other<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.220> cut<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.090> about<00:02:56.010> half<00:02:57.010> way

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.180 

that's<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.580> be<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.910> handle<00:03:04.709> okay<00:03:05.709> go

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that you have your three tubes what you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.300 
that you have your three tubes what you
need<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.810> save<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.830> one<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.070> later

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
need to do is save this one for later

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.870 
need to do is save this one for later
take<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.300> biggest<00:03:13.690> tube<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.580> your<00:03:15.580> second

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
take your biggest tube and your second

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.540 
take your biggest tube and your second
biggest<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.380> set<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:17.500> one<00:03:17.650> horizontally<00:03:18.370> and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
biggest to set this one horizontally and

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.160 
biggest to set this one horizontally and
this<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:19.030> kind<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.900> at<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> midpoint<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:22.170> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
this one kind of at a midpoint on the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.500 
this one kind of at a midpoint on the
longer<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:23.980> near<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:25.000> ends<00:03:25.360> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
longer one but near one of the ends and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.480 
longer one but near one of the ends and
then<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.350> one<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.010> use<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> lot<00:03:27.459> of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
then this one is going to use a lot of

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.990 
then this one is going to use a lot of
tape<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:28.870> need<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.170> do<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.530> get<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.550> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
tape what we need to do is get it on the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.729 
tape what we need to do is get it on the
one<00:03:31.180> end<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.570> then<00:03:32.410> tape<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:32.920> down<00:03:34.380> as<00:03:35.380> I'm

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
one end and then tape it down as I'm

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:51.350 
one end and then tape it down as I'm
doing<00:03:36.100> very<00:03:36.310> cuddly<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:39.130> way<00:03:40.320> we'll<00:03:41.320> break

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
