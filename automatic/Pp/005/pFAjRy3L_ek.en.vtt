00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.559
 in 1955 the engineer dante Giacosa la 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.169
 presentation of the sixteenth century fiat 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.839
 stated we tried to do 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.460
 new both for the sake of progress and 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.980
 to find more and more solutions 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.930
 simple this in excellent condition 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.760
 conservation is one of the very first 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.560
 prototypes of the 600 made in 1952 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.880
 apparently he is the only survivor of five 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.130
 built between 1952 and 54 all 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.130
 all different from each other with the name 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.950
 project the car wanted one hundred 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.780
 motorize post-war Italy 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.970
 substitute for the glorious little mouse had to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.670
 comfortably carry four people and a 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.700
 minimum baggage the project provided 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.710
 a weight that had to be around 450 kg 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.990
 and a cruising speed that does not 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 had to be less than 85 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.010
 then kilometers in 1952 lay then 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.510
 director of technical offices 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.220
 motor vehicles chose the solution more 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 simple and inexpensive 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.630
 as already done by ferdinand porsche for 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.049
 the volkswagen and renault for the 4 horses 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.750
 take everything back at your disposal 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.340
 rear engine and rear wheel drive 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.530
 weight savings were three points 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.109
 essential the supporting body was chosen 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.149
 to enclose the cockpit and the compartment of 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.729
 an engine designed ad hoc that he had 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.229
 dimensions decidedly contained on 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.679
 two-cylinder engine av with 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.649
 air cooling was 500 70 cm 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:36.380
 public the bodies in die-cast aluminum 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.869
 rear lights also acted as 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.850
 air conveyor a single axis a 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.200
 cams commanded the rockers and the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.689
 hera distribution 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 with other side features 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.759
 innovative of the prototype was the absolute 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.920
 lack of clutch pedal between 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.090
 the intent of the project was not only that 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.579
 that of building a car 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.560
 economic is capable but also of being 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.140
 extremely intuitive and easy to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.090
 conduct the layout of the mechanics 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.329
 in the engine compartment he then had to allow 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.159
 access to easy maintenance i 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.110
 results should have been 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.000
 rather disappointing given that the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.420
 engine design came to an end 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.190
 abandoned for the final 600 yes 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.260
 instead he chose a four-cylinder in 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.700
 water-cooled line that 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.980
 became a classic in the following years 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.160
 with various adaptations and increases of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.049
 cubature up to over 900 cc will arrive at 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.349
 motorize the 112 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.450
 the panda and the 1 the prototype we have 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.970
 photographed finished tests and abandonment 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.120
 of the twin-cylinder engine probably 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.930
 still mechanics was no longer used 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.430
 for several decades it has been blocked 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.530
 unloaded from the truck is moved by hand 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.859
 only one remains in our studies 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.549
 great curiosity to hear the sound of 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.549
 its twin-cylinder engine
