howdy<00:00:41.040> didn't<00:00:41.489> invent<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.020> it's<00:00:43.020> actually

howdy didn't invent it it's actually

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
howdy didn't invent it it's actually
been<00:00:43.500> used<00:00:43.739> before<00:00:43.910> by<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> countries<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
been used before by the countries that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
been used before by the countries that
would<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.590> were<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.890> able<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.520> fuel<00:00:47.910> by

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
would not were not able to get fuel by

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
would not were not able to get fuel by
other<00:00:48.600> means<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.230> example<00:00:49.610> Nazi<00:00:50.610> Germany

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
other means for example Nazi Germany

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.100 
other means for example Nazi Germany
during<00:00:51.090> World<00:00:51.329> War<00:00:51.570> two

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
during World War two

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.920 
during World War two
it's<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.460> energy<00:00:54.210> efficient<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's also not that energy efficient you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.430 
it's also not that energy efficient you
have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> spend<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.070> ton<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> energy<00:00:57.440> relative

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
have to spend a ton of energy relative

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
have to spend a ton of energy relative
to<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.100> recover<00:00:59.670> by<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.329> burning<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to what you recover by then burning this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
to what you recover by then burning this
fuel<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.280> surprised<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
fuel so I was kind of surprised that it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
fuel so I was kind of surprised that it
made<00:01:03.359> such<00:01:03.629> headlines<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.350> interesting<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
made such headlines as interesting as it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.700 
made such headlines as interesting as it
is<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.360> able<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> create<00:01:06.930> fuel<00:01:07.200> from<00:01:07.470> water

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
is to be able to create fuel from water

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
is to be able to create fuel from water
and<00:01:07.890> carbon<00:01:08.189> dioxide<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.510> is

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and carbon dioxide that this is

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.160 
and carbon dioxide that this is
something<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.680> 90<00:01:11.100> years<00:01:11.340> old

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
something that's that's 90 years old

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
something that's that's 90 years old
yeah<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.560> uh<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.340> unfortunately<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.360> still

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
yeah it's uh and unfortunately it still

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.710 
yeah it's uh and unfortunately it still
looks<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.200> something<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.799> relies<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
looks like it's something that relies on

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
looks like it's something that relies on
electrolysis<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.909> we

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
electrolysis which is not you know we

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
electrolysis which is not you know we
need<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.479> more<00:01:21.659> efficient<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.470> it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
need to be more efficient at that it's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
need to be more efficient at that it's
it's<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.520> best<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.450> most

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's not that the best the most

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's not that the best the most
streamlined<00:01:25.020> process<00:01:25.439> yet<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.299> it's<00:01:27.299> still

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
streamlined process yet so it's still

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
streamlined process yet so it's still
interesting<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.799> great<00:01:29.009> if

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
interesting and it it would be great if

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
interesting and it it would be great if
there<00:01:29.310> were<00:01:29.430> cars<00:01:29.640> running<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
there were cars running off this but you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.560 
there were cars running off this but you
know<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.530> gonna<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.920> this

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
know I don't think we're gonna see this

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
know I don't think we're gonna see this
you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.799> mass-produced<00:01:34.799> by<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.159> means<00:01:35.369> yeah

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you know mass-produced by any means yeah

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
you know mass-produced by any means yeah
and<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.939> only<00:01:36.090> does<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> process<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and not only does the process of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.859 
and not only does the process of
creating<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> fuel<00:01:37.920> itself<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.630> only

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
creating the fuel itself is it not only

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
creating the fuel itself is it not only
is<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.020> process<00:01:40.500> relatively<00:01:41.400> inefficient

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is that process relatively inefficient

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.240 
is that process relatively inefficient
but<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> order<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.320> enough<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> stuff

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
but in order to get enough of this stuff

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.730 
but in order to get enough of this stuff
that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.549> could<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> any<00:01:46.470> kind

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that you could really use it to any kind

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.069 
that you could really use it to any kind
of<00:01:46.799> great<00:01:47.009> extent<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.360> create<00:01:48.600> new

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
of great extent you have to create new

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.670 
of great extent you have to create new
plants<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.700> set<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
plants that are set up to do this and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
plants that are set up to do this and
that<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.399> additional<00:01:54.000> cost<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.479> an<00:01:54.630> added

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that is an additional cost and an added

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
that is an additional cost and an added
inefficiency<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:56.430> interesting<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.119> love

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
inefficiency so very interesting I love

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.139 
inefficiency so very interesting I love
this<00:01:57.509> type<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> research<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.439> let's<00:01:58.680> not

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
this type of research but let's not

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.190 
this type of research but let's not

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that it's something newer or or more
