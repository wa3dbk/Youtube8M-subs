00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 characteristics of a microphone 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.569
 professional condenser from the best 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.480
 value for money we will make a brief 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.360
 unboxing and we will discover the features 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 that differentiate a dynamic microphone 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.750
 from a condenser microphone let's start 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 to some technical features 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.949
 this microphone weighs about a pound 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.030
 and made of metal and is manufactured in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.090
 China but designed in Germany on 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.920
 three-pin base for cable contact 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.450
 xlr and a support for the microphone stand 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.879
 the pings are gold plated 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.489
 therefore it is recommended to use for the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.190
 high quality cable connection 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 possibly gold plated this is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.219
 the c1 microphone package at the bottom 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 on the right we have the logo of the house 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.539
 producer while top left 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.809
 we have the key features of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.610
 this appliance 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.020
 we take the opportunity to see the differences 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
 that there are between a microphone a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.130
 dynamic microphone capacitor il 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.470
 dynamic microphone is definitely that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 more widespread is the condenser microphone 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 uses a capacitor is the element 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.549
 key that translates the mechanical signal 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.549
 of sound waves in electrical signal 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.850
 this condenser microphone is also 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 much more delicate than a 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.440
 dynamic microphone and to manage it 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.800
 you need adequate sound cards or 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.690
 of professional mixers for what 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.390
 regards this mic we have a 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.880
 Russian led that indicates the status of 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.500
 appliance operation on 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.400
 forehead together with the microphone comes to us 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.680
 given a practical case with 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.820
 inside the sponge to protect 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.820
 the draw over time 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.610
 this microphone as all microphone a 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.069
 professional capacitor need 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.430
 of a 48-fold call power supply 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.230
 phantom power we can give 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.569
 this feed through a mixer 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.000
 through an adequate sound card that 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.300
 have this kind of features 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.030
 or through micropower ps 400 like 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040
 this we are about to see and by rai 48 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.050
 times needed 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.650
 this appliance is equipped with 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.900
 12 volt power supply and allows 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.530
 connect a microphone via a cable 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.310
 cannon canon and then attack the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.940
 micropower ps 400 to a mixer or a 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 adequate sound card via a cable 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.130
 cannon always attack that 3 mm 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.379
 this device suffers a bit from the 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.090
 noise generated by electrical signals ed 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.549
 electromagnetic therefore we recommend 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:18.049
 use good cables and keep the ps 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.049
 400 away from electromagnetic sources 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.250
 thanks for watching
