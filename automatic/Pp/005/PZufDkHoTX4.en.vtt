00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
going to want to stop finding it so if

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.970 
going to want to stop finding it so if
you<00:02:25.500> come<00:02:25.830> across<00:02:26.010> redstone<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.970> lapis<00:02:27.330> lazuli

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
you come across redstone a lapis lazuli

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.440 
you come across redstone a lapis lazuli
then<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:30.150> probably<00:02:30.180> gonna<00:02:31.050> find<00:02:32.450> some

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
then you are probably gonna find some

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.350 
then you are probably gonna find some
more<00:02:33.750> redstone<00:02:34.470> cuz<00:02:35.400> never<00:02:35.970> get<00:02:36.150> enough

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
more redstone cuz never get enough

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.500 
more redstone cuz never get enough
redstone<00:02:36.750> doing<00:02:37.260> threads<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.650> my<00:02:37.770> neck<00:02:37.950> guns

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
redstone doing threads on my neck guns

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.580 
redstone doing threads on my neck guns
so<00:02:39.680> yeah<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.640> only<00:02:41.820> mine<00:02:42.150> redstone

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
so yeah and you can only mine redstone

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.030 
so yeah and you can only mine redstone
within<00:02:43.590> iron<00:02:43.920> pickaxe<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.440> mine<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.860> with

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
within iron pickaxe if you mine it with

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.140 
within iron pickaxe if you mine it with
any<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.640> pickaxe<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.760> just

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
any other pickaxe then it's it's just

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.570 
any other pickaxe then it's it's just
gonna<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.440> waste<00:02:52.710> your<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.459> you're

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
gonna be a waste your time and you're

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.150 
gonna be a waste your time and you're
not<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.650> whenever<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.950> mind<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
not going to get it whenever your mind a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.530 
not going to get it whenever your mind a
block<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.580> gives<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.850> four<00:02:57.090> or<00:02:57.180> five<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.510> of

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
block it gives you four or five out of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:08.670 
block it gives you four or five out of
time<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:59.360> yep

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.910 

you<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:09.459> use<00:03:09.670> redstone<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:14.769> make<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you can use redstone for you can make a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.759 
you can use redstone for you can make a
railroad<00:03:15.629> track<00:03:16.629> or<00:03:17.439> you<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.670> use<00:03:19.769> redstone

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
railroad track or you can use redstone

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.890 
railroad track or you can use redstone
torch<00:03:21.159> and<00:03:21.519> red<00:03:21.879> circle<00:03:22.239> just<00:03:22.390> don't<00:03:22.599> give<00:03:22.750> off

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
torch and red circle just don't give off

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.559 
torch and red circle just don't give off
any<00:03:23.200> life<00:03:23.500> there<00:03:23.769> are<00:03:24.189> mainly<00:03:24.489> for<00:03:24.909> red<00:03:25.239> some

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
any life there are mainly for red some

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.720 
any life there are mainly for red some
railroad<00:03:26.439> tracks<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:28.439> in<00:03:29.439> lapis<00:03:29.769> lazuli<00:03:29.950> it's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
railroad tracks so in lapis lazuli it's

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.300 
railroad tracks so in lapis lazuli it's
kind<00:03:31.359> of<00:03:31.450> useless<00:03:31.810> except<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.709> can<00:03:32.889> only<00:03:33.010> make

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
kind of useless except you can only make

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
kind of useless except you can only make
um<00:03:34.500> blue<00:03:35.500> wool<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.780> probably<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.870> few<00:03:37.930> other

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
um blue wool and probably a few other

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.869 
um blue wool and probably a few other
things<00:03:38.349> but<00:03:39.090> ya<00:03:40.109> blue<00:03:41.109> rules<00:03:41.439> blue<00:03:42.010> wool<00:03:42.639> is

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
things but ya blue rules blue wool is

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.289 
things but ya blue rules blue wool is
pretty<00:03:43.150> much<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.889> can't<00:03:45.159> make<00:03:45.310> red

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
pretty much it and you can't make red

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.830 
pretty much it and you can't make red
bull<00:03:46.569> with<00:03:46.870> redstone<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> don't<00:03:49.389> you<00:03:49.659> don't

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
bull with redstone you don't you don't

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.210 
bull with redstone you don't you don't
have<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.109> have<00:03:50.139> an<00:03:50.379> iron<00:03:50.530> pickaxe<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.099> mine

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
have to have an iron pickaxe to mine

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:01.970 
have to have an iron pickaxe to mine
lapis<00:03:51.760> lazuli

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.920 

so<00:04:02.519> yeah<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.120> want<00:04:03.300> to<00:04:03.360> dig<00:04:03.510> deeper<00:04:03.840> you

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
so yeah if you want to dig deeper you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.449 
so yeah if you want to dig deeper you
can<00:04:04.050> go<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.379> dig<00:04:04.590> deeper<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:07.099> know<00:04:08.099> if<00:04:08.340> you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
can go and dig deeper and know if you

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.339 
can go and dig deeper and know if you
dig<00:04:08.610> deeper<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.510> come<00:04:10.170> across<00:04:10.379> bedrock<00:04:12.349> which

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
dig deeper you come across bedrock which

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.680 
dig deeper you come across bedrock which
bed<00:04:13.890> wrap<00:04:14.069> can't<00:04:14.370> be<00:04:14.489> broken<00:04:14.730> everybody<00:04:15.480> knows

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
bed wrap can't be broken everybody knows

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.420 
bed wrap can't be broken everybody knows
that

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.370 

and<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.580> didn't<00:04:25.820> even<00:04:25.850> dig<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.750> deep<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.320> we

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
and we didn't even dig that deep and we

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.730 
and we didn't even dig that deep and we
found<00:04:27.590> more<00:04:27.770> redstone<00:04:28.720> yay<00:04:29.720> gotta<00:04:30.530> love

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
found more redstone yay gotta love

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:38.370 
found more redstone yay gotta love
redstone<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:32.800> it's<00:04:33.800> getting<00:04:34.010> dark

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.500 

and<00:04:38.950> it<00:04:39.070> does<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.550> still<00:04:39.910> does<00:04:40.120> take<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> little

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
and it does it still does take a little

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.330 
and it does it still does take a little
while<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.050> mine<00:04:41.170> redstone<00:04:41.200> with<00:04:41.920> an<00:04:42.130> iron

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
while to mine redstone with an iron

00:04:42.340 --> 00:05:02.110 
while to mine redstone with an iron
pickaxe

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.350 

okay<00:05:03.120> now<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.480> continue<00:05:03.960> mining<00:05:04.620> our<00:05:05.100> our<00:05:05.820> red

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
okay now to continue mining our our red

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:31.530 
okay now to continue mining our our red
stuff

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.590 

but<00:05:32.110> in<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:32.380> world<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.860> they're<00:05:33.100> doing

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.070 

okay<00:05:38.410> I'm<00:05:39.220> gonna<00:05:39.550> take<00:05:39.760> beeper<00:05:40.150> see<00:05:40.840> what<00:05:41.020> I

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
okay I'm gonna take beeper see what I

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.220 
okay I'm gonna take beeper see what I
can<00:05:41.140> find<00:05:41.290> probably<00:05:42.280> some<00:05:42.430> bedrock<00:05:42.750> but<00:05:43.750> maybe

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
can find probably some bedrock but maybe

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:54.570 
can find probably some bedrock but maybe
stuff<00:05:44.680> around<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.010> pepper<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.880> never<00:05:46.090> know

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.920 

well<00:05:55.240> that's<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.530> slouchy

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.110 

ah<00:06:03.280> yep<00:06:04.280> some<00:06:05.000> bedrock<00:06:05.949> most<00:06:06.949> of<00:06:07.160> time<00:06:07.340> well

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
ah yep some bedrock most of time well

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.310 
ah yep some bedrock most of time well
not<00:06:08.210> all<00:06:08.419> the<00:06:08.449> time<00:06:08.720> sometimes<00:06:09.139> you<00:06:10.039> can<00:06:10.220> find

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
not all the time sometimes you can find

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.770 
not all the time sometimes you can find
things<00:06:12.320> around<00:06:12.590> bedrock<00:06:13.100> but<00:06:14.090> not<00:06:14.600> all<00:06:14.750> the

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
things around bedrock but not all the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.520 
things around bedrock but not all the
time<00:06:15.020> because<00:06:15.910> if<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:17.150> find<00:06:17.449> stuff<00:06:18.050> before

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
time because if you find stuff before

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.170 
time because if you find stuff before
you<00:06:18.560> find<00:06:18.889> bedrock<00:06:19.150> then<00:06:22.060> you're<00:06:23.060> probably

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
you find bedrock then you're probably

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.430 
you find bedrock then you're probably
not<00:06:23.389> going<00:06:23.600> to<00:06:23.660> find<00:06:23.810> anything<00:06:24.050> around<00:06:24.289> the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
not going to find anything around the
