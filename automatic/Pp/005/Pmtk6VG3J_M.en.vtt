technique of pruning those is totally

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.120 
technique of pruning those is totally
different<00:00:26.140> than<00:00:26.470> what<00:00:26.499> we've<00:00:26.740> done<00:00:26.769> in<00:00:27.039> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
different than what we've done in the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.179 
different than what we've done in the
past<00:00:27.369> it<00:00:27.849> is<00:00:28.419> with<00:00:29.409> a<00:00:29.439> climbing<00:00:29.859> rose<00:00:30.039> of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
past it is with a climbing rose of

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.230 
past it is with a climbing rose of
course<00:00:30.369> you<00:00:30.490> want<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.699> leave<00:00:30.849> some<00:00:31.029> more<00:00:31.150> of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
my tools in one place I didn't have to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.919 
my tools in one place I didn't have to
run<00:01:12.759> around<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.119> find<00:01:13.299> them<00:01:13.509> every<00:01:13.749> time<00:01:13.869> I

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
wanted to use them I'm ready to go for

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.209 
wanted to use them I'm ready to go for

any situation so Chris I'm all set with

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.010 
any situation so Chris I'm all set with
all<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.549> tools<00:01:18.850> right<00:01:19.119> here<00:01:19.179> so<00:01:19.569> now<00:01:19.600> what's

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
all the tools right here so now what's

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.450 
all the tools right here so now what's
the<00:01:20.200> next<00:01:20.380> step<00:01:20.679> what<00:01:20.920> are<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.100> looking<00:01:21.429> for

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the next step what are we looking for

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.249 
the next step what are we looking for
what<00:01:22.390> we're<00:01:22.539> doing<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.899> we're<00:01:22.990> going<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.140> look

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
what we're doing is we're going to look

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.389 
what we're doing is we're going to look
for<00:01:23.439> canes<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:23.859> can<00:01:24.009> train<00:01:24.249> out

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
for canes that we can train out

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.789 
for canes that we can train out
laterally<00:01:24.929> the<00:01:25.929> reason<00:01:26.229> it's<00:01:26.350> important<00:01:26.710> to

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
laterally the reason it's important to

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.620 
laterally the reason it's important to
train<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.130> many<00:01:27.340> canes<00:01:27.909> out<00:01:28.060> laterally<00:01:28.509> as

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
train as many canes out laterally as

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.419 
train as many canes out laterally as
possible<00:01:29.109> is<00:01:29.259> because<00:01:29.649> if<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.890> allow<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> cane

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
possible is because if you allow a cane

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.370 
possible is because if you allow a cane
to<00:01:30.579> grow<00:01:30.729> straight<00:01:31.090> up<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.929> will<00:01:32.079> typically

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
to grow straight up it will typically

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.260 
to grow straight up it will typically
only<00:01:32.649> bloom<00:01:33.009> on<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.429> tips<00:01:33.670> you'll<00:01:33.999> notice

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
only bloom on the tips you'll notice

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.639 
only bloom on the tips you'll notice
there's<00:01:34.420> not<00:01:34.539> a<00:01:34.569> lot<00:01:34.749> of<00:01:34.780> side<00:01:35.049> shoots<00:01:35.380> coming

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
there's not a lot of side shoots coming

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.160 
there's not a lot of side shoots coming
here<00:01:35.950> versus<00:01:36.819> this<00:01:36.939> cane<00:01:37.179> over<00:01:37.329> here<00:01:37.659> or<00:01:37.869> this

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
here versus this cane over here or this

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.779 
here versus this cane over here or this
one<00:01:38.229> where<00:01:38.560> we've<00:01:38.740> laterally<00:01:39.189> trained<00:01:39.460> and

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
one where we've laterally trained and

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.279 
one where we've laterally trained and
you<00:01:40.299> can<00:01:40.479> see<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.749> each<00:01:40.899> one<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.139> those

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
you can see in each one of those

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.379 
you can see in each one of those
produces<00:01:41.920> flowers<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.909> in<00:01:43.030> turn<00:01:43.210> you're

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
produces flowers so in turn you're

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
produces flowers so in turn you're
getting<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.689> for<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.899> whole<00:01:44.020> length<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
getting it for the whole length of the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.020 
getting it for the whole length of the
cane<00:01:44.649> versus<00:01:45.009> only<00:01:45.159> on<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.490> tip<00:01:45.639> of<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.850> cane

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
cane versus only on the tip of the cane

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.989 
cane versus only on the tip of the cane
so<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:47.560> great<00:01:47.770> against<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.280> fence<00:01:48.670> I

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
so and it's great against this fence I

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.520 
so and it's great against this fence I
mean<00:01:49.149> it's<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.359> great<00:01:49.509> idea<00:01:49.749> to<00:01:50.139> Train<00:01:50.380> it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
mean it's a great idea to Train it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.050 
mean it's a great idea to Train it
against<00:01:50.859> a<00:01:50.979> fence<00:01:51.189> they<00:01:51.429> don't<00:01:51.609> have<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.939> go

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
against a fence they don't have to go

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.239 
against a fence they don't have to go
into<00:01:52.209> an<00:01:52.389> arbor<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:53.049> can<00:01:53.229> hide<00:01:53.439> a<00:01:53.469> fence<00:01:53.889> you

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
into an arbor you can hide a fence you

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.580 
into an arbor you can hide a fence you
can<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:54.939> lot<00:01:55.209> more<00:01:55.240> with<00:01:55.749> them<00:01:55.990> than<00:01:56.289> just

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
can do a lot more with them than just

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.039 
can do a lot more with them than just
going<00:01:57.399> straight<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.909> exactly<00:01:58.779> in<00:01:58.899> fact

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
going straight up exactly in fact

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.080 
going straight up exactly in fact
they're<00:01:59.469> very<00:01:59.499> very<00:02:00.340> versatile<00:02:00.759> at<00:02:00.880> going

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
they're very very versatile at going

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.179 
they're very very versatile at going
sideways<00:02:01.359> you<00:02:02.109> get<00:02:02.289> much<00:02:02.499> more<00:02:02.529> bloom<00:02:02.979> out<00:02:03.159> of

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
sideways you get much more bloom out of

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.800 
sideways you get much more bloom out of
it<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.549> also<00:02:03.700> avoid<00:02:04.029> the<00:02:04.329> knobby<00:02:04.539> new

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it and you also avoid the knobby new

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.690 
it and you also avoid the knobby new
things<00:02:05.079> anytime<00:02:05.529> you<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.770> laterally<00:02:06.219> train

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
things anytime you can laterally train

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.090 
things anytime you can laterally train
it<00:02:06.789> keeps<00:02:07.299> foliage<00:02:07.749> and<00:02:07.959> flowers<00:02:08.140> lower<00:02:08.770> down

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
it keeps foliage and flowers lower down

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.759 
it keeps foliage and flowers lower down
on<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.340> plant<00:02:09.610> very<00:02:10.270> nice<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.560> one

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
on the plant very nice you know this one

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.530 
on the plant very nice you know this one
looks<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:12.610> would<00:02:12.849> take<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.239> bit<00:02:13.390> of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
looks like we would take a little bit of

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.300 
looks like we would take a little bit of
time<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:14.409> you<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.590> another<00:02:14.980> one<00:02:15.220> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
time to do but you have another one to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.260 
time to do but you have another one to
show<00:02:15.370> us<00:02:15.790> would<00:02:16.000> be

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
show us would be

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
show us would be

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
just like this with no flowers on it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880 
just like this with no flowers on it
just<00:02:24.910> was<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> really<00:02:25.270> pretty<00:02:25.810> pretty<00:02:26.500> piece

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
just was a really pretty pretty piece

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.000 
just was a really pretty pretty piece
now<00:02:27.160> show<00:02:27.430> us<00:02:27.580> exactly<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.330> happened<00:02:28.810> here

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
now show us exactly what happened here

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.110 
now show us exactly what happened here
what<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.130> did<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.400> we<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.670> went<00:02:31.090> through

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
what we did is we actually went through

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640 
what we did is we actually went through
and<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.510> had<00:02:31.600> thinned<00:02:31.840> out<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.170> Canes<00:02:32.440> we

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and we had thinned out the Canes we

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.990 
and we had thinned out the Canes we
picked<00:02:32.890> out<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> Canes<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.640> we<00:02:33.730> wanted<00:02:33.940> to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
picked out the Canes that we wanted to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.820 
picked out the Canes that we wanted to
keep<00:02:34.150> for<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.510> year<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.960> then<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:35.560> started

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
keep for this year and then we started

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.860 
keep for this year and then we started
training<00:02:36.070> them<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.460> laterally<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
training them out laterally and as you

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.240 
training them out laterally and as you
can<00:02:37.990> see<00:02:38.140> by<00:02:38.290> doing<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.680> look<00:02:38.860> at<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> buds

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
can see by doing that look at the buds

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.560 
can see by doing that look at the buds
that<00:02:39.370> actually<00:02:39.820> are<00:02:39.940> already<00:02:40.150> starting<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
that actually are already starting to

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.910 
that actually are already starting to
poke<00:02:40.720> out<00:02:40.870> each<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.380> those<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.620> actually

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
poke out each one of those is actually

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.070 
poke out each one of those is actually
going<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.100> produce<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.490> flower<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.930> see

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
going to produce a flower so you can see

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.990 
going to produce a flower so you can see
the<00:02:44.200> advantages<00:02:44.710> over<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.130> versus<00:02:45.640> having<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
the advantages over this versus having a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.250 
the advantages over this versus having a
plant<00:02:46.210> that<00:02:46.270> just<00:02:46.510> grows<00:02:46.660> straight<00:02:46.900> up<00:02:47.050> right

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
plant that just grows straight up right

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.140 
plant that just grows straight up right
you<00:02:47.830> know<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> great<00:02:48.850> visual

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
you know I think this is a great visual

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.900 
you know I think this is a great visual
we<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.600> get<00:02:49.810> really<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.710> good<00:02:51.130> idea<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.670> what<00:02:51.880> to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
we can get really a good idea of what to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.880 
we can get really a good idea of what to
do<00:02:52.120> with<00:02:52.240> our<00:02:52.420> roses<00:02:52.630> at<00:02:52.960> home<00:02:53.170> thank<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.680> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890
