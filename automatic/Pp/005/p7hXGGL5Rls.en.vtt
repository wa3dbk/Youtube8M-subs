00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240 

I<00:00:02.870> have<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.020> best<00:00:04.350> bar<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:05.040> some<00:00:06.980> six<00:00:07.980> gauge

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
I have this best bar and some six gauge

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.150 
I have this best bar and some six gauge
wires<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.559> put<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:10.740> own<00:00:10.800> terminal<00:00:11.309> ends<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
wires I put my own terminal ends on that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.750 
wires I put my own terminal ends on that
and<00:00:15.500> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> ground<00:00:17.720> with<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.760> charging

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and this is the ground with a charging

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.470 
and this is the ground with a charging
system<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:22.519> the<00:00:23.519> solar<00:00:23.850> system<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:26.119> each<00:00:27.119> wire

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
system on the solar system and each wire

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.350 
system on the solar system and each wire
I<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.830> 24<00:00:29.279> volt<00:00:30.529> system<00:00:31.640> each<00:00:32.640> wire<00:00:33.030> goes

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I have 24 volt system each wire goes

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.709 
I have 24 volt system each wire goes
over<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:36.260> 24<00:00:37.260> volt<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:38.280> 24<00:00:39.030> volt<00:00:39.270> batteries

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
over to 24 volt to 24 volt batteries

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.610 
over to 24 volt to 24 volt batteries
this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.920> ground<00:00:41.570> for<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:43.760> set<00:00:44.760> of

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
this is the ground for one set of

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
this is the ground for one set of
batteries<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.980> makes<00:00:47.190> 24<00:00:47.670> volt<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.059> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
batteries that makes 24 volt and then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.670 
batteries that makes 24 volt and then
there's<00:00:49.170> another<00:00:49.320> ground<00:00:50.100> wire<00:00:50.989> right<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.930 

it<00:00:55.680> comes<00:00:55.710> over<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.960> connects<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.940> set

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it comes over here connects to this set

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.609 
it comes over here connects to this set
of<00:00:59.969> batteries<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.170> 24<00:01:01.649> volts<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.450 

got<00:01:10.619> these<00:01:11.119> gold-plated<00:01:12.119> connections<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
got these gold-plated connections I

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690 
got these gold-plated connections I
think<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.970> were<00:01:15.030> intended<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:17.280> car

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
think they were intended for like car

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.649 
think they were intended for like car
stereos<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.240> stuff<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:20.250> any<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
stereos and stuff but any way to get a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.990 
stereos and stuff but any way to get a
really<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:22.140> connection<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.820> use

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
really good connection if you can use

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880 
really good connection if you can use
gold<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.540> platinum<00:01:24.689> platinum<00:01:25.409> pretty

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
gold or platinum platinum pretty

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
gold or platinum platinum pretty
expensive<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:27.360> I've<00:01:27.479> got<00:01:27.750> gold<00:01:27.990> plated

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
expensive and I've got gold plated

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
expensive and I've got gold plated
terminals<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.070> they're<00:01:29.250> probably<00:01:30.060> solid

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
terminals I think they're probably solid

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.830 
terminals I think they're probably solid
brass<00:01:31.880> gold-plated<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> point<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.540> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
brass gold-plated but the point is is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.969 
brass gold-plated but the point is is
that<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> positive<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that you want to have a positive and a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.260 
that you want to have a positive and a
negative<00:01:41.659> wire<00:01:43.280> running<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> each<00:01:44.610> battery<00:01:45.090> if

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
negative wire running to each battery if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
negative wire running to each battery if
you<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> 12-volt<00:01:46.259> system<00:01:46.470> each

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you have like a 12-volt system each

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.580 
you have like a 12-volt system each
battery<00:01:47.369> would<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.729> its<00:01:47.880> own<00:01:48.409> charging<00:01:49.409> wire

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
battery would have its own charging wire

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.810 
battery would have its own charging wire
so<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.479> equal<00:01:52.640> amount<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so that they get equal amount of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
so that they get equal amount of
charging<00:01:55.520> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.969> hook<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.860> say

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
charging if you just hook it up to say

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.280 
charging if you just hook it up to say
one<00:01:59.579> battery<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.680> end<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:03.290> first

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
one battery on the end that first

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.510 
one battery on the end that first
battery<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> most<00:02:05.759> charge

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
battery is going to get the most charge

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.819 
battery is going to get the most charge
but<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:09.030> still<00:02:09.509> haven't<00:02:09.720> done<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> positive

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
but I still haven't done the positive

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.229 
but I still haven't done the positive
wiring<00:02:12.730> side<00:02:12.969> yet<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.420> started<00:02:14.079> with<00:02:14.200> this

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
wiring side yet I just started with this

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.959 
wiring side yet I just started with this
ground<00:02:16.239> part<00:02:16.689> I<00:02:17.129> have<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.159> bus<00:02:18.519> wire<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:18.939> I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
ground part I have a bus wire but I

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.750 
ground part I have a bus wire but I
haven't<00:02:19.180> installed<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.750> yet<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:20.859> did<00:02:21.549> this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
haven't installed it yet I did this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.250 
haven't installed it yet I did this
yesterday<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.599> thought<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.930> might<00:02:23.109> like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
yesterday and I thought you might like

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.479 
yesterday and I thought you might like
to<00:02:23.290> see<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:28.049> let's<00:02:29.049> see<00:02:29.260> I've<00:02:30.250> been

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
to see it and let's see I've been

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.789 
to see it and let's see I've been
switching<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:31.120> my<00:02:31.389> I<00:02:34.709> guess<00:02:35.709> it's<00:02:35.980> got<00:02:37.799> too

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
switching all my I guess it's got too

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.640 
switching all my I guess it's got too
much<00:02:38.980> voltage<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:39.909> a<00:02:39.939> little<00:02:40.090> bit<00:02:40.650> it's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
much voltage there for a little bit it's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.929 
much voltage there for a little bit it's
dumping<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.189> guess<00:02:42.370> we're<00:02:42.519> getting<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:42.760> lot<00:02:42.879> of

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
dumping I guess we're getting a lot of

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.990 
dumping I guess we're getting a lot of
Sun<00:02:43.269> but<00:02:44.079> anyway<00:02:44.500> I'm<00:02:45.069> trying<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.549> switch<00:02:45.760> all

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
Sun but anyway I'm trying to switch all

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.809 
Sun but anyway I'm trying to switch all
my<00:02:46.180> little<00:02:46.389> post<00:02:46.689> out<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.980> gold<00:02:48.250> plate<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:48.790> I

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
my little post out with gold plate so I

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.550 
my little post out with gold plate so I
can<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.329> most<00:02:49.480> electricity<00:02:50.049> flowing

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
can get the most electricity flowing

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.530 
can get the most electricity flowing
through<00:02:50.709> there<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.340> my<00:02:54.489> old<00:02:54.730> term<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.480> own

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
through there and my old term for my own

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.500 
through there and my old term for my own
post<00:02:55.840> look<00:02:56.049> like<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.340> bunny<00:02:58.030> winter

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
post look like this and bunny winter

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.330 
post look like this and bunny winter
they<00:02:59.169> look<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.500> that<00:03:01.590> anyway<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.889> thought<00:03:03.189> you

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
they look like that anyway I thought you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.269 
they look like that anyway I thought you
might<00:03:03.489> like<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.730> see<00:03:04.060> that
