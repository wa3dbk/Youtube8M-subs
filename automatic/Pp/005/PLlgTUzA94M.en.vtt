basically<00:02:21.780> barbarian<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.950> Archer<00:02:23.280> rush<00:02:23.550> and

basically barbarian and Archer rush and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.490 
basically barbarian and Archer rush and
that<00:02:24.239> never<00:02:24.480> loses<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> couple<00:02:26.310> balloons
