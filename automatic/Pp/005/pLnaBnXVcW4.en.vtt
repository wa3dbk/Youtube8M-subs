things by now so just have a go at

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.270 
things by now so just have a go at
plucking<00:03:36.840> those<00:03:36.959> strings<00:03:37.290> again<00:03:37.440> four<00:03:37.950> three

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
plucking those strings again four three

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.270 
plucking those strings again four three
two<00:03:38.549> one

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.730 

okay<00:03:42.030> very<00:03:42.330> good<00:03:42.390> now<00:03:43.050> once<00:03:43.319> you've<00:03:43.500> done<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
okay very good now once you've done that

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740 
okay very good now once you've done that
I<00:03:44.160> want<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.610> go<00:03:44.730> back<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.300> second

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
I want you to go back to the second

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.890 
I want you to go back to the second
string<00:03:46.020> with<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.410> middle<00:03:46.680> finger<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.900> then

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
string with the middle finger and then

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.160 
string with the middle finger and then
the<00:03:49.050> third<00:03:49.260> string<00:03:49.709> with<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.250> first<00:03:50.459> finger

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
the third string with the first finger

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.960 
the third string with the first finger
so<00:03:52.170> if<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.500> join<00:03:52.830> those<00:03:53.040> notes<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.640> end<00:03:53.790> it

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
so if we join those notes on the end it

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.880 
so if we join those notes on the end it
should<00:03:54.000> sound<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:54.480> this

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.700 

okay<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.300> what<00:04:00.450> happens<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.200> can<00:04:01.380> repeat

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
okay now what happens is you can repeat

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.590 
okay now what happens is you can repeat
that<00:04:01.920> over<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.460> over<00:04:02.610> again<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.360> joins

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that over and over again and it joins

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:14.190 
that over and over again and it joins
together<00:04:03.900> perfectly<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.860> this

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.379 

okay<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.400> can<00:04:15.550> see<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.970> sounds

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
okay and you can see that that sounds

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.140 
okay and you can see that that sounds
really<00:04:16.780> nice<00:04:16.930> now<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.590> suggest<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.370> can<00:04:18.669> change

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
really nice now I suggest you can change

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.569 
really nice now I suggest you can change
their<00:04:19.419> different<00:04:19.750> chords<00:04:20.109> for<00:04:21.010> example<00:04:21.400> if<00:04:21.489> we

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
their different chords for example if we

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.250 
their different chords for example if we
went<00:04:21.730> to<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> G<00:04:22.180> chord<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.930> course<00:04:23.110> you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
went to the G chord and of course you

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.720 
went to the G chord and of course you
already<00:04:23.380> know<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.830> G<00:04:23.980> chord<00:04:24.220> because<00:04:24.460> we

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
already know the G chord because we

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.800 
already know the G chord because we
learned<00:04:24.940> that<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.300> one<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.600> previous

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
learned that in one of the previous

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.620 
learned that in one of the previous
segments<00:04:26.530> but<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.669> refresh<00:04:27.970> your<00:04:28.270> memory

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.480 
segments but just to refresh your memory

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
the first string at fret 3 ok you can

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.790 
the first string at fret 3 ok you can
pause<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.810> video<00:04:40.930> if<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.350> just<00:04:41.530> need<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
pause the video if you just need to

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.890 
pause the video if you just need to
check<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.100> now<00:04:42.820> what's<00:04:43.120> going<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.389> happen<00:04:43.750> is

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
check that now what's going to happen is

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.110 
check that now what's going to happen is
the<00:04:44.440> thumb<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.040> now<00:04:45.190> going<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.460> put<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.790> sixth

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
the thumb is now going to put the sixth

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.390 
the thumb is now going to put the sixth
string<00:04:46.360> because<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.410> some<00:04:47.650> always<00:04:47.830> plucks<00:04:48.250> a

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
string because the some always plucks a

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.100 
string because the some always plucks a
root<00:04:48.580> note<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.090> chord<00:04:49.120> when<00:04:49.750> we<00:04:49.930> were<00:04:50.050> on

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
root note of the chord when we were on

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.050 
root note of the chord when we were on
the<00:04:50.350> D<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.800> root<00:04:50.979> note<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.820> fourth

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
the D the root note was the fourth

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.180 
the D the root note was the fourth
string<00:04:52.360> but<00:04:52.600> now<00:04:52.750> we're<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.139> G<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.979> root

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
string but now we're on the G the root

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.159 
string but now we're on the G the root
note<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.729> sixth<00:04:55.030> string<00:04:55.120> ok<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.780> hope<00:04:56.050> that

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
note is the sixth string ok I hope that

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.440 
note is the sixth string ok I hope that
makes<00:04:56.380> sense<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.370> these<00:04:57.580> three<00:04:57.820> fingers<00:04:58.060> are

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
makes sense but these three fingers are

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.120 
makes sense but these three fingers are
still<00:04:58.720> going<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.080> be<00:04:59.169> on<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.380> same<00:04:59.590> strings<00:04:59.950> as

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
still going to be on the same strings as

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.340 
still going to be on the same strings as
before<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.729> third<00:05:00.940> string<00:05:01.330> second<00:05:02.110> string

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
before the third string second string

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.530 
before the third string second string
and<00:05:02.560> first<00:05:02.860> string<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:03.760> when<00:05:04.000> we<00:05:04.150> apply<00:05:04.479> this

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
and first string so when we apply this

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.870 
and first string so when we apply this
picking<00:05:05.139> pattern<00:05:05.500> it'll<00:05:05.800> sound<00:05:05.950> like<00:05:06.070> this

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.110 

great<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.260> what<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.440> suggest<00:05:14.620> you<00:05:14.890> do<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.640> do

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
great so what I suggest you do is to do

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.180 
great so what I suggest you do is to do
that<00:05:16.300> picking<00:05:16.690> pattern<00:05:17.050> twice<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.590> D<00:05:17.890> and

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
that picking pattern twice on the D and

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.370 
that picking pattern twice on the D and
then<00:05:18.730> twice<00:05:19.060> on<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.270> G<00:05:19.540> so<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.050> should<00:05:20.230> sound

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
then twice on the G so it should sound

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.340 
then twice on the G so it should sound
like<00:05:20.500> this

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.220 

you

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:41.090 

and<00:05:30.680> then<00:05:30.800> you<00:05:30.950> can<00:05:31.100> do<00:05:31.250> again

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.020 

you

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
you

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.420 
you
okay<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.720> think<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.260> get<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.500> idea<00:05:44.590> now<00:05:45.400> I

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
okay I think you get the idea now I

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.820 
okay I think you get the idea now I
suggest<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:46.150> practice<00:05:47.020> that<00:05:47.410> with<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.710> other

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
suggest you practice that with the other

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.470 
suggest you practice that with the other
chords<00:05:48.160> you<00:05:48.220> know<00:05:48.340> as<00:05:48.490> well<00:05:48.610> like<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:48.940> E<00:05:49.150> and
