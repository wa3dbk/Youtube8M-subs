00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
better if we had two islands however I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.669 
better if we had two islands however I
think<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.820> fine<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> raw<00:00:12.660> egg<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
think it's fine we have the raw egg to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
think it's fine we have the raw egg to
hold<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.950> ground<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:15.059> he's<00:00:15.389> blue<00:00:15.599> white<00:00:15.870> he

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
hold the ground if he's blue white he

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.859 
hold the ground if he's blue white he
