what's up guys captain back again I'm
are<00:00:03.629> upgrading<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:04.290> electrical<00:00:04.950> staff<00:00:05.400> we

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
are upgrading this electrical staff we

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970 
are upgrading this electrical staff we
want<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.210> nobody's<00:00:06.509> keyboard<00:00:07.290> keys<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
want to nobody's keyboard keys on the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.709 
want to nobody's keyboard keys on the
button<00:00:08.370> from<00:00:08.580> one<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.880> seven<00:00:09.120> from<00:00:09.420> left<00:00:09.660> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
button from one to seven from left to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.209 
button from one to seven from left to
right<00:00:09.809> amigo<00:00:10.910> 136<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.540> force<00:00:12.780> card<00:00:13.219> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
right amigo 136 is the force card the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.210 
right amigo 136 is the force card the
next<00:00:14.490> card<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.630> odds<00:00:15.839> except<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.740> number

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
next card is the odds except for number

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.189 
next card is the odds except for number
one<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.880> will<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.060> three<00:00:18.510> five<00:00:19.109> seven<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
one so it will be three five seven and

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.330 
one so it will be three five seven and
the<00:00:22.199> last<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.730> evens<00:00:24.269> which<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.410> 2

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the last one is all the evens which is 2

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.599 
the last one is all the evens which is 2
for<00:00:26.970> 6<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.349> long<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> nobody<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> from

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
for 6 so as long as you nobody is from

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.759 
for 6 so as long as you nobody is from
one<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> seven<00:00:30.269> from<00:00:30.750> left<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.140> using

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
one to seven from left to right using

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.520 
one to seven from left to right using
that<00:00:31.890> code<00:00:32.160> should<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.669> fine<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.870> three<00:00:34.230> six

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that code should be fine one three six

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.780 
that code should be fine one three six
three<00:00:35.149> five<00:00:36.149> seven<00:00:36.690> two<00:00:37.350> four<00:00:37.620> six<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> that's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
three five seven two four six and that's

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.290 
three five seven two four six and that's
the<00:00:38.969> fourth<00:00:39.210> step<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> next<00:00:40.829> step<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the fourth step and the next step is the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.470 
the fourth step and the next step is the
electrical<00:00:42.809> switches<00:00:43.320> around<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.950> map<00:00:44.480> some

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
electrical switches around the map some

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
electrical switches around the map some
people<00:00:45.780> say<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.140> random<00:00:46.579> I've<00:00:47.579> done

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
people say these are random I've done

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
people say these are random I've done
this<00:00:48.000> seven<00:00:48.809> eight<00:00:48.960> times<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.010> always

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
this seven eight times and it's always

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.420 
this seven eight times and it's always
been<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> same<00:00:51.059> sequence<00:00:52.430> presumably

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
been the same sequence presumably

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
been the same sequence presumably
because<00:00:53.699> nobody<00:00:54.570> has<00:00:54.899> messed<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
because nobody has messed about with the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
because nobody has messed about with the
switches<00:00:56.730> saying<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.690> wonder<00:00:57.899> what<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.199> are

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
switches saying I wonder what these are

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.770 
switches saying I wonder what these are
for<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.920> flip<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> switch<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> messes<00:01:00.660> with

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
for and flip the switch and messes with

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260 
for and flip the switch and messes with
the<00:01:00.870> sequence<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.890> force<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.059> we're

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the sequence but force one here we're

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.960 
the sequence but force one here we're
gonna<00:01:03.420> exit<00:01:04.110> through<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> portal<00:01:05.309> teleporter

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
gonna exit through the portal teleporter

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
gonna exit through the portal teleporter
from<00:01:06.330> crazy<00:01:06.960> place<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.070> bring<00:01:08.220> us<00:01:08.460> up

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
from crazy place which will bring us up

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
from crazy place which will bring us up
to<00:01:08.729> stamina<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.799> gonna<00:01:10.950> hit

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to stamina and we're just gonna hit

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.429 
to stamina and we're just gonna hit
unweight<00:01:11.760> under<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:12.180> switches<00:01:12.570> until<00:01:13.290> they

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
unweight under your switches until they

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.039 
unweight under your switches until they
stop<00:01:13.740> spiking<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.960> sequence<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.040> found<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.840> be

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
stop spiking the sequence I found to be

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.380 
stop spiking the sequence I found to be
over<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:21.320> stamina<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.780> tank<00:01:24.780> area

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
over and over is stamina the tank area

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.679 
over and over is stamina the tank area
right<00:01:27.390> above<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> church<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.570> be

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
right above me and the church will be

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.249 
right above me and the church will be
the<00:01:30.810> next<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.329> after<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> where<00:01:34.110> we're

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the next one and after that where we're

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.640 
the next one and after that where we're
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> electrical<00:01:36.780> switch<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
going to the electrical switch which is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
going to the electrical switch which is
by<00:01:38.900> juggernog<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.920> around<00:01:41.700> where

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
by juggernog it's actually around where

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.200 
by juggernog it's actually around where
the<00:01:42.470> robot<00:01:43.470> steps<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.130> around<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.270> side

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
bombs is the sixth one and I believe

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.260 
bombs is the sixth one and I believe
this<00:02:34.710> has<00:02:34.830> happened<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.460> don't<00:02:36.120> know<00:02:36.180> how<00:02:36.240> many

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
this has happened I don't know how many

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
this has happened I don't know how many
times<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.960> there<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.160> workshop

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
times but there is one in the workshop

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.830 
times but there is one in the workshop
just<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.800> exit<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.640> no<00:02:41.790> man's<00:02:42.090> land<00:02:42.209> but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
just on the exit to no man's land but

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.020 
just on the exit to no man's land but
it's<00:02:43.020> always<00:02:43.290> torn<00:02:43.800> off<00:02:44.070> or<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.640> say<00:02:44.850> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it's always torn off or so say it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350 
it's always torn off or so say it's

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
always in the correct position so we

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.570 
always in the correct position so we
always<00:02:48.510> skip<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:50.070> just<00:02:50.340> here<00:02:50.550> on

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.130 
always skip that one it's just here on
the<00:02:50.790> right<00:02:50.940> hand<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.360> we're<00:02:51.630> gonna<00:02:51.750> skip<00:02:51.959> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
right now we just line up all these

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.740 
right now we just line up all these
disks<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:32.710> finally<00:04:33.710> get<00:04:33.830> rid<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:34.040> that<00:04:34.160> or

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
disks to finally get rid of that or

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
there we go and buy it so it goes

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:47.820 
there we go and buy it so it goes
through<00:04:39.760> into<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.850> crazy<00:04:41.060> place<00:04:45.550> so<00:04:46.550> that's

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
through into the crazy place so that's

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.150 
through into the crazy place so that's
upgrading<00:04:48.830> stage<00:04:50.080> /<00:04:51.080> step<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.560> just<00:04:51.590> throw<00:04:52.010> it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
upgrading stage / step is just throw it
