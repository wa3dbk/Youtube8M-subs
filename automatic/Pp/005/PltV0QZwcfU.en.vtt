look a little on the small side but when

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.520 
look a little on the small side but when
I<00:01:43.270> look<00:01:43.450> at<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.600> like<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.380> looks

I look at it like this it just looks

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.680 
I look at it like this it just looks
perfectly<00:01:45.040> fine<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.060> may<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.600> was

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
perfectly fine so it may be that it was

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.630 
perfectly fine so it may be that it was
just<00:01:46.900> done<00:01:47.080> looking<00:01:47.380> at<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.590> giant<00:01:48.040> Godzilla

look<00:01:51.340> at<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.880> think<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.299> looks<00:01:52.479> like<00:01:52.630> it's

connected with ball pegs you can get

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.710 
connected with ball pegs you can get
just<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.489> head<00:03:30.640> all<00:03:30.760> by<00:03:30.879> itself<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.269> look<00:03:31.420> down

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
just the head all by itself to look down

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.410 
just the head all by itself to look down
you<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.260> rotate<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:33.010> side<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.250> side<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:33.730> this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
you can rotate it side to side like this

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.809 
you can rotate it side to side like this
and<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.989> pivots<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.620> little<00:03:35.829> bit<00:03:36.010> right<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.489> he

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and it pivots a little bit right here he

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.550 
and it pivots a little bit right here he
also<00:03:36.940> has<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> neck<00:03:37.480> joint<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.930> rotates<00:03:38.319> side

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
also has a neck joint that rotates side

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.020 
also has a neck joint that rotates side
to<00:03:38.739> side<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.129> can<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.579> move<00:03:39.700> back<00:03:40.000> a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
to side you can get it to move back a

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.699 
to side you can get it to move back a
little<00:03:40.239> bit<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.019> moves<00:03:41.200> down<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> little

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
little bit and it moves down a little

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.039 
little bit and it moves down a little
bit<00:03:41.919> and<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.700> can<00:03:42.880> get<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.389> pivot<00:03:43.569> as<00:03:43.810> well

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
bit and you can get it to pivot as well

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.720 
bit and you can get it to pivot as well
he<00:03:44.319> has<00:03:44.410> shoulders<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.919> move<00:03:45.099> outward<00:03:45.549> you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
he has shoulders that move outward you

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.789 
he has shoulders that move outward you
can<00:03:45.940> move<00:03:46.120> them<00:03:46.269> forward<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.319> scales<00:03:47.650> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
can move them forward and the scales and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.110 
can move them forward and the scales and
everything<00:03:47.889> are<00:03:48.190> sculpted<00:03:48.669> all<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:49.030> way

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
everything are sculpted all the way

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.550 
everything are sculpted all the way
through<00:03:49.389> here<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.900> can<00:03:49.930> see<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.500> just

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
through here you can see that it just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.050 
through here you can see that it just
goes<00:03:50.799> all<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.099> way<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.310> there<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:51.880> don't

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
goes all the way in there and you don't

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.699 
goes all the way in there and you don't
have<00:03:52.150> any<00:03:52.419> weird<00:03:52.660> blank<00:03:53.019> spots<00:03:53.379> or<00:03:53.560> anything

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
have any weird blank spots or anything

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.530 
have any weird blank spots or anything
like<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:53.919> so<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.519> lot<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:54.910> rotation<00:03:55.150> right

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
like that so a lot of rotation right

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.539 
like that so a lot of rotation right
here<00:03:55.720> at<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> shoulder<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.739> elbow<00:03:56.769> bends<00:03:57.370> at

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
here at the shoulder the elbow bends at

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.659 
here at the shoulder the elbow bends at
90<00:03:57.790> degrees<00:03:58.120> also<00:03:58.480> rotates<00:03:59.459> Godzilla<00:04:00.459> and

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
90 degrees also rotates Godzilla and

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.400 
90 degrees also rotates Godzilla and
then<00:04:00.940> he<00:04:01.060> rotates<00:04:01.510> right<00:04:01.690> here<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.169> wrist

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
then he rotates right here on the wrist

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.960 
then he rotates right here on the wrist
and<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:02.919> actually<00:04:03.160> on<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.310> ball<00:04:03.519> peg<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.879> you

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
and it's actually on a ball peg so you

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.520 
and it's actually on a ball peg so you
can<00:04:04.060> move<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.329> any<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.660> around<00:04:04.780> right<00:04:05.109> here

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
can move in any way around right here

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.770 
can move in any way around right here
and<00:04:05.709> then<00:04:06.160> he<00:04:06.250> has<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> diaphragm<00:04:06.970> joint<00:04:07.569> or<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and then he has a diaphragm joint or a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.839 
and then he has a diaphragm joint or a
waist<00:04:08.079> joint<00:04:08.500> whatever<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.250> want<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.459> call<00:04:09.639> it

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
waist joint whatever you want to call it

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.490 
waist joint whatever you want to call it
actually<00:04:10.239> I<00:04:10.269> don't<00:04:10.480> know<00:04:10.569> and<00:04:10.750> rotate<00:04:11.169> it<00:04:11.290> side

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
actually I don't know and rotate it side

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.849 
actually I don't know and rotate it side
to<00:04:11.530> side

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
to side

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.009 
to side
and<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.340> moves<00:04:12.549> forward<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.180> back<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> little

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
and it moves forward and back a little

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.599 
and it moves forward and back a little
bit<00:04:14.230> too<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:14.859> that's<00:04:15.010> pretty<00:04:15.220> cool<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.519> you

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
bit too so that's pretty cool and you

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.129 
bit too so that's pretty cool and you
can<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:15.910> shift<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.239> away<00:04:16.449> from<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> spines

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
can just shift it away from the spines

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.539 
can just shift it away from the spines
if<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.380> want<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.560> move<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.799> back<00:04:18.010> more<00:04:18.310> you

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
if you want to move it back more you

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.710 
if you want to move it back more you
know<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:18.849> that's<00:04:19.000> pretty<00:04:19.269> nice

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
know so that's pretty nice

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.210 
know so that's pretty nice
you<00:04:20.019> had<00:04:20.139> some<00:04:20.260> nice<00:04:20.380> hip<00:04:20.620> joints<00:04:20.889> over<00:04:20.979> here

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
you had some nice hip joints over here

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.100 
you had some nice hip joints over here
they<00:04:21.370> move<00:04:21.579> outward<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.720> can't<00:04:22.960> rotate

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
they move outward and you can't rotate

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.659 
they move outward and you can't rotate
forward<00:04:23.680> with<00:04:23.830> these<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:24.250> they<00:04:24.370> kind<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.610> have

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
forward with these but they kind of have

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.640 
forward with these but they kind of have
that<00:04:24.760> angle<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.330> him<00:04:25.630> he<00:04:25.810> also<00:04:25.960> has<00:04:26.139> knees<00:04:26.410> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
that angle to him he also has knees that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.379 
that angle to him he also has knees that
rotate<00:04:27.010> side<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.310> side<00:04:27.669> and<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.180> can

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
rotate side to side and you can

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.790 
rotate side to side and you can
straighten<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.840> legs<00:04:29.110> out<00:04:29.349> a<00:04:29.410> little<00:04:29.530> bit

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
straighten the legs out a little bit

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.529 
straighten the legs out a little bit
right<00:04:29.979> there<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:30.669> that's<00:04:30.849> pretty<00:04:31.030> cool<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.330> do

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
right there so that's pretty cool you do

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.300 
right there so that's pretty cool you do
get<00:04:31.750> some<00:04:32.020> bending<00:04:32.620> right<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:33.010> at<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.160> knee

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
get some bending right there at the knee

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.279 
get some bending right there at the knee
and<00:04:33.550> straighten<00:04:34.150> out<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.539> much<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.169> it

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
and straighten out that much but it

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.960 
and straighten out that much but it
doesn't<00:04:35.530> bend<00:04:35.710> anymore<00:04:36.130> than<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.370> going

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
doesn't bend anymore than that going

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.850 
doesn't bend anymore than that going
inward<00:04:37.449> he<00:04:37.840> has<00:04:37.930> ankles<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.289> move<00:04:38.470> down<00:04:38.650> and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
inward he has ankles that move down and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.189 
inward he has ankles that move down and
up<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.220> little<00:04:39.370> bit<00:04:39.580> he<00:04:40.000> does<00:04:40.270> have<00:04:40.510> ankle<00:04:40.900> pivot

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
up a little bit he does have ankle pivot

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.230 
up a little bit he does have ankle pivot
which<00:04:41.320> is<00:04:41.470> nice<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.490> first<00:04:42.699> 2014

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
which is nice so this is the first 2014

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.720 
which is nice so this is the first 2014
Godzilla<00:04:43.720> figure<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.020> have<00:04:44.199> with

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
Godzilla figure I have with

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.190 
Godzilla figure I have with
pivot<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.300> rotates<00:04:45.630> side<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.930> side<00:04:46.080> as

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.750 
pivot and it rotates side to side as
well<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.590> it<00:04:46.950> does<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.220> peg<00:04:47.400> holes<00:04:47.580> at<00:04:47.700> the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
well and it does have peg holes at the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.160 
well and it does have peg holes at the
bottom<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:48.090> each<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.420> its<00:04:48.480> feet<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:48.900> then<00:04:49.080> on

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
bottom of each of its feet and then on

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.020 
bottom of each of its feet and then on
to<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.440> tail<00:04:49.650> it<00:04:49.860> rotates<00:04:50.280> right<00:04:50.520> here<00:04:50.790> at<00:04:50.940> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
to the tail it rotates right here at the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.760 
to the tail it rotates right here at the
base<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.510> tail<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.230> shifts<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:52.620> and

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
base of the tail and it shifts in and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.290 
base of the tail and it shifts in and
out<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.040> these<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.340> all<00:04:53.430> on<00:04:53.610> ball<00:04:53.910> joints<00:04:54.210> you

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
out so these are all on ball joints you

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.820 
out so these are all on ball joints you
can<00:04:54.330> pretty<00:04:54.690> much<00:04:54.780> rotate<00:04:55.200> them<00:04:55.380> all<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.680> way

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
can pretty much rotate them all the way

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.890 
can pretty much rotate them all the way
around<00:04:56.160> same<00:04:56.700> thing<00:04:56.880> with<00:04:57.000> this<00:04:57.210> right<00:04:57.870> here

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
around same thing with this right here

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.800 
around same thing with this right here
so<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.590> get<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:58.890> two<00:04:59.310> three<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.570> then<00:05:00.750> a

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
so you get one two three and then a

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.780 
so you get one two three and then a
fourth<00:05:01.260> joint<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:02.010> over<00:05:02.280> here<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.670> is

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
fourth joint right over here and this is

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.150 
fourth joint right over here and this is
where<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.060> attaches<00:05:03.360> into<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.170> body<00:05:04.440> which<00:05:05.010> is

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
where it attaches into the body which is

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.470 
where it attaches into the body which is
kind<00:05:05.340> of<00:05:05.370> tough<00:05:05.760> pushing<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.270> in<00:05:06.360> there

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
kind of tough pushing it in there

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.670 
kind of tough pushing it in there
especially<00:05:06.600> because<00:05:06.960> these<00:05:07.170> spikes<00:05:07.530> are

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
especially because these spikes are

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.350 
especially because these spikes are
pretty<00:05:07.950> sharp<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.730> most<00:05:08.940> definitely<00:05:09.300> an

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
pretty sharp this is most definitely an

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.180 
pretty sharp this is most definitely an
adult<00:05:09.720> collectible<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.650> don't<00:05:10.920> want<00:05:11.130> to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
adult collectible so you don't want to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.410 
adult collectible so you don't want to
be<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.490> know<00:05:11.520> letting<00:05:11.790> kids<00:05:12.030> hitting<00:05:12.330> each

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
be you know letting kids hitting each

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.410 
be you know letting kids hitting each
other<00:05:12.630> with<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.930> oh<00:05:13.970> they<00:05:14.970> could<00:05:15.090> scratch

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
other with this oh they could scratch

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.660 
other with this oh they could scratch
each<00:05:15.600> other<00:05:15.750> pretty<00:05:16.080> bad<00:05:16.290> but<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.160> can<00:05:17.400> move

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
each other pretty bad but you can move

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.490 
each other pretty bad but you can move
this<00:05:17.880> part<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.450> out<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.080> bendy

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
this part in and out and it is a bendy

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.260 
this part in and out and it is a bendy
tail<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.980> you<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.580> see<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.820> little<00:05:21.030> vent

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
tail and you can see the little vent

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.090 
tail and you can see the little vent
things<00:05:21.690> right<00:05:21.930> here<00:05:22.110> for<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.320> bendy<00:05:22.620> tail<00:05:22.800> and

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
things right here for the bendy tail and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.620 
things right here for the bendy tail and
it<00:05:23.280> goes<00:05:23.460> all<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.730> way<00:05:23.910> up<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.150> here<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:24.390> once

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
it goes all the way up to here so once

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.520 
it goes all the way up to here so once
you<00:05:24.720> get<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.930> this<00:05:25.110> point

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
you get to this point

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.010 
you get to this point
it<00:05:25.680> no<00:05:26.190> longer<00:05:26.220> bends<00:05:26.760> so<00:05:27.210> let's<00:05:27.600> see<00:05:27.810> actually

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
it no longer bends so let's see actually

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.020 
it no longer bends so let's see actually
the<00:05:28.560> last<00:05:28.710> bending<00:05:29.130> point<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.550> really<00:05:29.850> right

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
the last bending point is really right

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.210 
the last bending point is really right
there<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.600> Godzilla<00:05:31.050> stands<00:05:31.410> at<00:05:31.620> about<00:05:31.860> six

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
there so Godzilla stands at about six

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.490 
there so Godzilla stands at about six
