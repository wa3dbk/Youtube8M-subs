00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.449
 guillaume da spent a few months in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.740
 box 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.500
 what are you up to and what about 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 city ​​so generally I have a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.509
 impression very positive since the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 first thing is that I spent 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.780
 on all the summer months so this is a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.780
 region that is very beautiful 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.970
 a natural level on the Loire is a 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.250
 the only river 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.419
 which is really wild in France I 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.560
 believe that's what I think 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.210
 the area is very beautiful there is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.620
 many things to visit every 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.519
 castles at birth even amboise he 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.980
 there is the house where leonard 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:47.180
 vinci died to a past past 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.620
 years monga amboise castle and then 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.399
 good there is the city ​​of towers too who 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.250
 is about 20 minutes 20 30 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.730
 minutes by car or train gift 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.739
 is a very beautiful city with a center 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.510
 bah past preserved with respect to 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.510
 medieval historic center 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 if not good the city of the city of amboise 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 we'll say she's about halfway 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.990
 route between the village and the city 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.460
 because it's both a city 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 because we can not know everything 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 the world but 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.930
 there is still a mood and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 nice enough since my opinion there are some 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 small traders have we go quickly 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.430
 spotted 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.630
 my stores gradually we get 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.070
 meeting we know people anyway 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.290
 so there is this little atmosphere of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.900
 village that is pretty cool and that is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.030
 anyway 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.790
 finally there is also the presence of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.520
 eurocentre students who brings a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.560
 little international touch with all 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.820
 the Japanese and the Germans the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.950
 mexicans who 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.350
 and it is that they give life etc 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.110
 that give life to the city and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.880
 especially the presence of mick jagger 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.010
 oh yes for us but he has a castle in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:16.510
 three kilometers from the center of amboise and 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.950
 Well, it's a star, it's a small 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 tail was actually it's more of a 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.420
 legend because no one has seen it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 so we do not know if he's really here 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.480
 but it attracts the curious so 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.650
 that's another positive aspect of this 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.739
 beautiful city of amboise 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.940
 so if you have the opportunity to come there 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.930
 you will have a wonderful holiday 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.930
 thank you very much nothing
