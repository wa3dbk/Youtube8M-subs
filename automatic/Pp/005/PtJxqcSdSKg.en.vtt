show you an update for um my epic
project<00:00:18.990> i<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.160> quick<00:00:20.340> calculation<00:00:20.720> earlier

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
project i do a quick calculation earlier

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.740 
project i do a quick calculation earlier
on<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.289> i'm<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:23.330> forty<00:00:24.330> six

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
on that i'm up to about forty six

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.120 
on that i'm up to about forty six
percent<00:00:24.930> complete<00:00:25.680> that's<00:00:26.640> based<00:00:26.849> on

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
percent complete that's based on

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.030 
percent complete that's based on
calculate<00:00:29.130> percentages<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.779> I've<00:00:30.960> done

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
calculate percentages of what I've done

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
calculate percentages of what I've done
so<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.219> calculating<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> I've<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so like calculating that I've about this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
so like calculating that I've about this
far<00:00:34.079> done<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.890> part<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.460> ninety

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
far done with one part so like ninety

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
far done with one part so like ninety
percent<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.239> part<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> whatever<00:00:37.110> another

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
percent in one part and whatever another

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.729 
percent in one part and whatever another
and<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.820> yeah<00:00:38.940> ran<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.300> forty<00:00:40.020> six<00:00:40.559> percent

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and so yeah ran about forty six percent

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.750 
and so yeah ran about forty six percent
that's<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.660> taken<00:00:43.050> forever<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> load<00:00:43.620> duh<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's just taken forever to load duh I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
that's just taken forever to load duh I
can<00:00:45.030> understand<00:00:45.450> why<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> lot<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
can understand why it's a lot to it and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
can understand why it's a lot to it and
I've<00:00:47.670> done<00:00:47.879> quite<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.300> bit<00:00:48.390> since<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:48.870> last<00:00:49.050> made

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I've done quite a bit since i last made

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
I've done quite a bit since i last made
a<00:00:49.289> video<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:50.570> my<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.190> it's

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a video on my thing so this here it's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
a video on my thing so this here it's
probably<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> latest<00:00:54.300> edition<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.469> rest

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
probably the latest edition and the rest

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.080 
probably the latest edition and the rest
of<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:56.129> section<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.940> talk

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
of this back section here which are talk

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.099 
of this back section here which are talk
about<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> well<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> binary

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
about it well this here is a binary

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.820 
about it well this here is a binary
decoder<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> i've<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.670> i've<00:01:03.120> decided<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:04.140> i've

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
decoder so i've got i've decided or i've

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.750 
decoder so i've got i've decided or i've
converted<00:01:05.369> my<00:01:05.670> system<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> binary<00:01:06.810> decoder

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
converted my system to a binary decoder

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.219 
converted my system to a binary decoder
a<00:01:08.760> binary<00:01:09.799> storage<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.310> binary<00:01:11.670> decoder

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
a binary storage and then binary decoder

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
a binary storage and then binary decoder
because<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.650> more<00:01:13.680> efficient<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.689> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
because it's a lot more efficient and so

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
because it's a lot more efficient and so
for<00:01:15.869> example<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:18.180> character

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
for example that there is one character

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
for example that there is one character
so<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> letter<00:01:21.150> M<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> comes

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
so that is a letter M so when it comes

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
so that is a letter M so when it comes
through<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> goes<00:01:24.750> backwards

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
through it because it goes backwards

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
through it because it goes backwards
through<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.530> comes<00:01:25.799> back<00:01:26.040> through<00:01:26.310> here

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
through there comes back through here

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
through there comes back through here
and<00:01:28.340> will<00:01:29.340> code<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.560> probably<00:01:31.560> roundabout

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and will code for probably roundabout

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
and will code for probably roundabout
hereish<00:01:32.460> M<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.909> was<00:01:35.970> right

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
hereish M which I think I was right

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
hereish M which I think I was right
right<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> money<00:01:37.049> almost<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:38.840> was<00:01:39.840> how

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right on the money almost I was how

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
right on the money almost I was how
about<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.360> exactly<00:01:42.540> am<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.740> do

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
about that that is exactly am what do

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
about that that is exactly am what do
you<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.729> yeah<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you know so yeah that's my there so it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.280 
you know so yeah that's my there so it
comes<00:01:46.680> through<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.509> code<00:01:48.780> M<00:01:49.079> which

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
comes through here it would code M which

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
comes through here it would code M which
is<00:01:49.470> M<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.250> currently<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> five-by-five<00:01:51.090> array

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is M is currently a five-by-five array

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.289 
is M is currently a five-by-five array
of<00:01:51.960> numbers<00:01:52.549> by<00:01:53.549> hope<00:01:53.729> trust<00:01:53.880> me<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.180> not

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
of numbers by hope trust me I do not

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.520 
of numbers by hope trust me I do not
script<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.990> lucky<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
script that I was just lucky and so that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
script that I was just lucky and so that
M<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:59.159> come<00:01:59.399> through<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.030> screen<00:02:00.329> here

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
M will come through on this screen here

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.429 
M will come through on this screen here
and<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.530> screen<00:02:01.799> these<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.790> bus<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.439> then

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
and the screen these this bus and then

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.859 
and the screen these this bus and then
display<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.009> screen<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.659> looks

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
display on the screen now you this looks

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
display on the screen now you this looks
a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:07.079> more<00:02:07.140> complicated<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.580> know

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
a lot more complicated then I know

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
a lot more complicated then I know
scrolling<00:02:09.659> texting<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.439> because

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
scrolling texting and that's because

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.479 
scrolling texting and that's because
I've<00:02:10.950> added<00:02:11.329> the<00:02:12.329> functionality<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:13.489> three

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
I've added the functionality for three

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.140 
I've added the functionality for three
possible<00:02:15.060> speeds<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.040> thing<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
possible speeds on the on the thing so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.000 
possible speeds on the on the thing so
let<00:02:18.659> me<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.900> reset<00:02:19.290> these<00:02:19.409> two<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:21.030> lag<00:02:22.010> I'm

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
let me just reset these two that lag I'm

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
let me just reset these two that lag I'm
going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.700> eventually<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.150> them<00:02:24.390> connected

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
going to eventually have them connected

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.500 
going to eventually have them connected
in<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
in there but that's this is just a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.179 
in there but that's this is just a
manual<00:02:27.900> function<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.439> I<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.650> play<00:02:28.859> with<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.129> a

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
manual function so I can play with it a

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.360 
manual function so I can play with it a
bit<00:02:29.220> more<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.659> for<00:02:31.470> example<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.069> wanted

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
bit more so like for example if I wanted

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.660 
bit more so like for example if I wanted
it<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.909> be<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.959> middle<00:02:34.470> speed<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:35.430> two

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it to be the middle speed these two

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.309 
it to be the middle speed these two
would<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:35.939> down<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.750> would<00:02:36.930> go<00:02:37.079> down

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
would go down so that one would go down

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.140 
would go down so that one would go down
and<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.299> go<00:02:39.450> down<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.970> yeah

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and that one we go down and so yeah

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.479 
and that one we go down and so yeah
that's<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:43.650> essentially<00:02:44.129> how<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.340> going

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that's that's essentially how it's going

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.599 
that's that's essentially how it's going
to<00:02:44.519> work<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:44.970> i'll<00:02:45.030> probably<00:02:46.370> have<00:02:47.370> another

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
to work so i'll probably have another

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.089 
to work so i'll probably have another
binary<00:02:47.940> system<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.019> have<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> two-bit

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
binary system for that so have a two-bit

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.849 
binary system for that so have a two-bit
system<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.379> work<00:02:52.409> out<00:02:52.799> perfectly

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
system and that would work out perfectly

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.289 
system and that would work out perfectly
for<00:02:54.379> functioning<00:02:55.379> which<00:02:55.530> speed<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.489> on<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
for functioning which speed is is on and

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.330 
for functioning which speed is is on and
which<00:02:57.450> ones<00:02:57.659> are<00:02:57.810> off<00:02:58.040> but<00:02:59.040> I'll<00:02:59.129> worry<00:02:59.280> about

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
which ones are off but I'll worry about

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.410 
which ones are off but I'll worry about
that<00:02:59.489> later<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:01.609> yeah<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:02.879> essentially<00:03:03.209> how

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that later so yeah so essentially how

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.479 
that later so yeah so essentially how
this<00:03:03.599> back<00:03:03.840> section<00:03:04.049> work<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.040> just

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
this back section work this is just

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.920 
this back section work this is just
basically<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.909> scrolling<00:03:06.329> text<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.780> is

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
basically the scrolling text this is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
basically the scrolling text this is
where<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.819> restored<00:03:08.819> why<00:03:09.689> isn't<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
where the restored why isn't that on the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.050 
where the restored why isn't that on the
stored<00:03:12.030> questions<00:03:13.370> why<00:03:14.370> isn't<00:03:14.639> that<00:03:14.669> on<00:03:14.879> I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
stored questions why isn't that on I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.530 
stored questions why isn't that on I
worry<00:03:15.389> about<00:03:15.419> that<00:03:15.690> later<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:17.660> that's<00:03:18.660> not<00:03:18.870> on

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
worry about that later but that's not on

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.569 
worry about that later but that's not on
odd<00:03:21.540> oh<00:03:23.239> I<00:03:24.239> see<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:25.530> line<00:03:25.769> there<00:03:26.099> is<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
odd oh I see that line there is it is

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:34.620 
odd oh I see that line there is it is
down<00:03:28.609> interesting

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.070 

on<00:03:35.410> two<00:03:35.860> seconds<00:03:37.380> that's<00:03:38.380> weird<00:03:39.960> should<00:03:40.960> be

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
on two seconds that's weird should be

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.760 
on two seconds that's weird should be
fixed<00:03:41.500> now<00:03:42.030> yep<00:03:43.050> that's<00:03:44.050> weird<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.440> don't<00:03:44.680> know

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
fixed now yep that's weird I don't know

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.770 
fixed now yep that's weird I don't know
why<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:44.920> did<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.160> all<00:03:46.090> right<00:03:46.210> anyway<00:03:46.660> it's

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
why I did that all right anyway it's

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.980 
why I did that all right anyway it's
fixed<00:03:46.990> now<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.950> these<00:03:48.460> here<00:03:48.670> after<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.780> user

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
fixed now so these here after the user

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.060 
fixed now so these here after the user
inputted<00:03:51.660> responses<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.290> bottom<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:53.800> being

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
inputted responses the bottom one being

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.700 
inputted responses the bottom one being
the<00:03:54.160> first<00:03:54.520> one<00:03:54.730> stored<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.450> that<00:03:56.110> will<00:03:56.320> go<00:03:56.650> to

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
the first one stored and that will go to

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.420 
the first one stored and that will go to
here<00:03:57.750> since<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.870> read<00:03:59.080> from<00:03:59.380> left<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.340> right

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
here since you read from left to right

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.850 
here since you read from left to right
this<00:04:01.180> will<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.630> first<00:04:01.870> user<00:04:02.410> inputted

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
this will be the first user inputted

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.040 
this will be the first user inputted
letter<00:04:03.190> which<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.270> come<00:04:04.450> from<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.660> bottom

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
letter which you come from that bottom

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.200 
letter which you come from that bottom
row<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.560> each<00:04:05.680> row<00:04:06.070> each<00:04:06.460> corresponding<00:04:07.000> row

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
row and each row each corresponding row

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.490 
row and each row each corresponding row
is<00:04:07.480> an<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.400> digit<00:04:09.400> from<00:04:09.580> on<00:04:09.940> here<00:04:10.300> so<00:04:11.020> let's<00:04:11.410> have

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
is an a digit from on here so let's have

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.050 
is an a digit from on here so let's have
a<00:04:11.560> look<00:04:11.590> at<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:11.860> inside<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.460> can<00:04:12.640> kind<00:04:13.030> of

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
a look at the inside so you can kind of

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.340 
a look at the inside so you can kind of
see<00:04:13.120> what<00:04:13.300> I'm<00:04:13.360> talking<00:04:13.420> about<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.990> what<00:04:14.200> this

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
see what I'm talking about and what this

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.229 
see what I'm talking about and what this
is<00:04:14.500> all<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.790> especially<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.940> are<00:04:15.970> new

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
is all about especially if you are new

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.580 
is all about especially if you are new
to<00:04:16.270> my<00:04:16.510> system<00:04:17.110> or<00:04:17.350> my<00:04:18.160> project<00:04:19.470> you'll<00:04:20.470> be

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
to my system or my project you'll be

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.960 
to my system or my project you'll be
able<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.739> understand<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.250> better<00:04:21.310> now<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:21.790> don't

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
able to understand it better now I don't

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.670 
able to understand it better now I don't
know<00:04:22.060> why<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.270> lighting<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:22.990> messed<00:04:23.230> up<00:04:23.410> it's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
know why the lighting so messed up it's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.000 
know why the lighting so messed up it's
a<00:04:24.510> it's<00:04:25.510> something<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.110> have<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.380> fix<00:04:26.560> up<00:04:26.770> later

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
a it's something I have to fix up later

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.630 
a it's something I have to fix up later
though<00:04:28.170> but<00:04:29.170> yeah<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.740> wasn't<00:04:30.130> like<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.490> in

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
though but yeah it wasn't like this in

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.370 
though but yeah it wasn't like this in
minute<00:04:30.850> ago<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.300> essentially<00:04:32.050> what's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
minute ago so essentially what's

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.740 
minute ago so essentially what's
happening<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.950> these<00:04:33.880> sections<00:04:34.240> below<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
happening is these sections below the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.990 
happening is these sections below the
red<00:04:34.930> wall<00:04:36.090> for<00:04:37.090> my<00:04:37.390> user<00:04:37.720> inputted<00:04:38.290> answers

question<00:04:41.770> scroll<00:04:42.130> across<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:44.340> see<00:04:45.340> be<00:04:45.460> able

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
question scroll across and see be able

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.010 
question scroll across and see be able
to<00:04:45.670> see<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.940> question<00:04:46.090> scroll<00:04:46.570> across<00:04:46.690> and

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
to see the question scroll across and

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.340 
to see the question scroll across and
then<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.200> be<00:04:47.320> able<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.770> input<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:49.210> answer<00:04:49.780> so

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
then you be able to input and answer so

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.350 
then you be able to input and answer so
it's<00:04:50.740> very<00:04:51.070> different<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:51.610> anything<00:04:51.970> else

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
it's very different to anything else

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.180 
it's very different to anything else
you've<00:04:52.540> probably<00:04:53.170> ever<00:04:53.290> played<00:04:53.710> before<00:04:53.890> and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
you've probably ever played before and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.640 
you've probably ever played before and
that<00:04:55.090> redstone<00:04:55.390> is<00:04:55.540> known<00:04:56.020> for<00:04:56.200> its<00:04:56.410> own<00:04:56.530> the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
that redstone is known for its own the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.880 
that redstone is known for its own the
lighting<00:04:57.040> is<00:04:57.160> really<00:04:57.190> messed<00:04:57.940> up<00:04:58.320> but<00:04:59.320> I<00:04:59.350> will

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
lighting is really messed up but I will

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.840 
lighting is really messed up but I will
fix<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.460> up<00:05:00.550> later<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:02.950> yeah<00:05:03.130> that's<00:05:03.280> the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
fix it up later and so yeah that's the

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.490 
fix it up later and so yeah that's the
basis<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.480> this<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:05.050> my<00:05:05.230> input

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
basis of it this here is my input

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.610 
basis of it this here is my input
selection<00:05:05.980> for<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:07.260> for<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.290> different

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
selection for the for the different

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.570 
selection for the for the different
buttons<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.280> like<00:05:09.520> here's<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.600> my<00:05:11.580> buttons

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
buttons so like here's a my buttons

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.040 
buttons so like here's a my buttons
they're<00:05:12.910> eventually<00:05:13.090> going<00:05:13.450> to<00:05:13.510> connect<00:05:13.840> to

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
they're eventually going to connect to

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.010 
they're eventually going to connect to
this<00:05:14.470> thing<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:16.060> then<00:05:16.240> from<00:05:16.480> there<00:05:16.540> to

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
this thing and then from there to

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.840 
this thing and then from there to
wherever<00:05:17.230> they<00:05:17.470> go<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:18.010> is<00:05:18.190> for<00:05:19.110> those

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
wherever they go this is for those

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.730 
wherever they go this is for those
letters<00:05:21.850> of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.090> alphabet<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.690> eventually<00:05:23.590> go

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
letters of the alphabet to eventually go

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.250 
letters of the alphabet to eventually go
and<00:05:23.890> imprint<00:05:24.280> on<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.790> memory<00:05:25.350> for<00:05:26.940> display

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
and imprint on this memory for display

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.690 
and imprint on this memory for display
so<00:05:29.260> there's<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.440> lot<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.650> different<00:05:30.400> things<00:05:30.430> to

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
so there's a lot of different things to

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.000 
so there's a lot of different things to
take<00:05:30.820> into<00:05:30.880> account<00:05:31.270> this<00:05:31.750> here<00:05:32.140> this<00:05:32.170> stack

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
take into account this here this stack

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.770 
take into account this here this stack
which<00:05:33.250> is<00:05:33.400> currently<00:05:33.610> too<00:05:33.880> high<00:05:34.090> will<00:05:34.660> be<00:05:34.750> a

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
which is currently too high will be a

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.260 
which is currently too high will be a
lot<00:05:35.020> higher<00:05:35.230> when<00:05:35.470> it's<00:05:35.590> done<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.910> this<00:05:37.090> is

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
lot higher when it's done and this is

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.960 
lot higher when it's done and this is
where<00:05:37.510> all<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.840> text<00:05:38.260> is<00:05:38.380> stored<00:05:38.970> currently

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
where all the text is stored currently

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.710 
where all the text is stored currently
I've<00:05:40.090> stored<00:05:40.330> about<00:05:40.690> half<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.860> sentence<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
I've stored about half a sentence I

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.270 
I've stored about half a sentence I
recently<00:05:43.720> obviously<00:05:44.500> restarted<00:05:45.010> all<00:05:45.100> that

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
recently obviously restarted all that

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.239 
recently obviously restarted all that
but<00:05:45.910> this<00:05:46.150> whole<00:05:46.479> line

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
but this whole line

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.729 
but this whole line
this<00:05:48.429> whole<00:05:48.639> line<00:05:48.969> from<00:05:49.299> the<00:05:49.929> very<00:05:50.439> back<00:05:50.709> of

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:50.739 
this whole line from the very back of

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.239 
this whole line from the very back of
the<00:05:50.889> screen<00:05:51.249> to<00:05:51.969> hear<00:05:52.269> stores<00:05:53.169> 70<00:05:54.039> characters

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:54.249 
the screen to hear stores 70 characters

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.359 
the screen to hear stores 70 characters
or<00:05:54.729> 71<00:05:55.689> at<00:05:55.809> maximum<00:05:56.259> so<00:05:56.949> I'm<00:05:57.069> pretty<00:05:57.249> happy

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:57.369 
or 71 at maximum so I'm pretty happy

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:01.679 
or 71 at maximum so I'm pretty happy
about<00:05:57.639> that<00:05:58.439> so<00:05:59.439> I'm<00:06:00.039> going<00:06:00.099> to<00:06:00.689> haven't

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:01.689 
about that so I'm going to haven't

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:03.059 
about that so I'm going to haven't
started<00:06:01.929> storing<00:06:02.139> my<00:06:02.289> questions<00:06:02.709> yet<00:06:02.949> or

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
started storing my questions yet or

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.189 
started storing my questions yet or
anything<00:06:03.099> like<00:06:03.369> that<00:06:03.549> but<00:06:04.509> they're<00:06:04.869> coming

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
anything like that but they're coming

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.879 
anything like that but they're coming
and<00:06:05.379> I'm<00:06:06.309> working<00:06:06.639> on<00:06:06.759> it<00:06:06.909> so<00:06:07.629> yeah<00:06:08.409> I<00:06:08.649> still

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
and I'm working on it so yeah I still

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.379 
and I'm working on it so yeah I still
come<00:06:09.009> to<00:06:09.039> i<00:06:09.159> picked<00:06:09.429> up<00:06:09.549> the<00:06:09.699> em<00:06:09.849> straight<00:06:10.179> away

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
come to i picked up the em straight away

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.569 
come to i picked up the em straight away
that<00:06:10.419> with<00:06:10.659> that<00:06:11.199> was<00:06:11.289> awesome<00:06:11.589> I've<00:06:12.399> been

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:12.579 
that with that was awesome I've been

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.339 
that with that was awesome I've been
working<00:06:12.909> up<00:06:12.999> just<00:06:13.149> too<00:06:13.299> much<00:06:13.449> I<00:06:13.599> think<00:06:13.629> so

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
working up just too much I think so

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.749 
working up just too much I think so
essentially<00:06:14.649> what<00:06:14.829> happens<00:06:15.159> is<00:06:15.309> as<00:06:15.549> you<00:06:15.639> can

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
essentially what happens is as you can

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.219 
essentially what happens is as you can
see<00:06:15.849> as<00:06:15.909> a<00:06:15.999> whole<00:06:16.149> bunch<00:06:16.359> of<00:06:16.479> torches<00:06:16.869> and<00:06:17.079> what

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
see as a whole bunch of torches and what

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.539 
see as a whole bunch of torches and what
that<00:06:17.409> basically<00:06:17.619> how<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.339> works<00:06:18.519> is<00:06:18.959> a

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:20.549 
that basically how that works is a

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:23.279 
that basically how that works is a
binary<00:06:21.549> number<00:06:21.939> will<00:06:22.089> come<00:06:22.239> through<00:06:22.719> down

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
binary number will come through down

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.429 
binary number will come through down
down<00:06:24.099> this<00:06:24.309> thing<00:06:24.989> and<00:06:25.989> then<00:06:26.169> what<00:06:26.319> will

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
down this thing and then what will

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.139 
down this thing and then what will
happen<00:06:26.709> is<00:06:26.829> it<00:06:26.860> will<00:06:27.009> come<00:06:27.249> down<00:06:27.279> through<00:06:27.789> here

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:28.149 
happen is it will come down through here

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:32.429 
happen is it will come down through here
and<00:06:29.189> for<00:06:30.189> every<00:06:30.309> lote<00:06:30.969> if<00:06:31.179> there's<00:06:31.749> some<00:06:32.019> these

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:32.439 
and for every lote if there's some these

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:34.559 
and for every lote if there's some these
will<00:06:32.649> correspond<00:06:33.189> to<00:06:33.369> the<00:06:33.879> different<00:06:33.909> values

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:34.569 
will correspond to the different values

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:40.909 
will correspond to the different values
so<00:06:34.839> this<00:06:35.589> only<00:06:35.709> has<00:06:35.949> one<00:06:36.219> torch<00:06:36.489> on<00:06:36.729> now<00:06:37.709> this

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.079 

actually<00:06:41.919> I<00:06:42.129> probably<00:06:42.309> should<00:06:42.549> modify<00:06:42.819> it<00:06:42.999> a

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:43.089 
actually I probably should modify it a

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.919 
actually I probably should modify it a
little<00:06:43.119> bit<00:06:44.369> yeah<00:06:45.369> I'm<00:06:45.969> still<00:06:46.269> working<00:06:46.629> on<00:06:46.749> how

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:46.929 
little bit yeah I'm still working on how

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:49.289 
little bit yeah I'm still working on how
I'm<00:06:47.019> going<00:06:47.199> to<00:06:47.289> have<00:06:47.499> it<00:06:47.529> display<00:06:47.979> but<00:06:48.249> it's<00:06:48.789> um

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:49.299 
I'm going to have it display but it's um

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:50.909 
I'm going to have it display but it's um
essentially<00:06:49.989> for<00:06:50.199> each<00:06:50.319> one<00:06:50.499> of<00:06:50.529> these<00:06:50.679> that's

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
essentially for each one of these that's

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:52.859 
essentially for each one of these that's
coded<00:06:51.189> it<00:06:51.489> will<00:06:51.639> print<00:06:52.329> out<00:06:52.509> a<00:06:52.569> different

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:52.869 
coded it will print out a different

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:56.759 
coded it will print out a different
letter<00:06:53.199> of<00:06:53.529> the<00:06:54.189> alphabet<00:06:54.219> and<00:06:54.789> then<00:06:55.649> it<00:06:56.649> will

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:56.769 
letter of the alphabet and then it will

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:58.529 
letter of the alphabet and then it will
display<00:06:57.099> on<00:06:57.129> the<00:06:57.249> screen<00:06:57.339> that's<00:06:58.059> how<00:06:58.269> I'm

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
display on the screen that's how I'm

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.459 
display on the screen that's how I'm
going<00:06:58.719> to<00:06:59.849> do<00:07:00.849> everything<00:07:01.029> basically<00:07:01.779> it's

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:02.469 
going to do everything basically it's

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:03.989 
going to do everything basically it's
going<00:07:02.739> to<00:07:02.769> be<00:07:02.889> the<00:07:03.009> it's<00:07:03.189> probably<00:07:03.549> easiest

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:03.999 
going to be the it's probably easiest

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:09.929 
going to be the it's probably easiest
way<00:07:04.209> to<00:07:04.269> do<00:07:04.539> it<00:07:04.659> and<00:07:05.909> in<00:07:06.909> yeah<00:07:08.009> I<00:07:09.009> don't<00:07:09.879> know

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:09.939 
way to do it and in yeah I don't know

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.850 
way to do it and in yeah I don't know
what<00:07:10.029> else<00:07:10.089> to<00:07:10.239> say<00:07:10.479> i<00:07:10.689> think<00:07:11.199> i've<00:07:11.349> i've

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
what else to say i think i've i've

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.419 
what else to say i think i've i've
covered<00:07:12.099> what<00:07:12.339> i<00:07:12.399> wanted<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.699> cover<00:07:13.079> and

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:14.429 
covered what i wanted to cover and

00:07:14.429 --> 00:07:16.739 
covered what i wanted to cover and
actually<00:07:15.429> I<00:07:15.489> already<00:07:15.669> can<00:07:16.299> see<00:07:16.449> a<00:07:16.479> problem

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:16.749 
actually I already can see a problem

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:18.299 
actually I already can see a problem
with<00:07:16.869> this<00:07:17.139> system<00:07:17.349> I<00:07:17.679> need<00:07:17.829> to<00:07:17.919> work<00:07:18.069> on<00:07:18.249> that

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:18.309 
with this system I need to work on that

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:20.069 
with this system I need to work on that
so<00:07:18.879> probably<00:07:19.209> be<00:07:19.299> different<00:07:19.659> next<00:07:19.719> time<00:07:19.869> you

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:20.079 
so probably be different next time you

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.169 
so probably be different next time you
see<00:07:20.229> it<00:07:20.339> and<00:07:21.339> I<00:07:21.459> still<00:07:21.639> need<00:07:21.759> to<00:07:21.849> hook<00:07:21.999> up<00:07:22.149> my

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:22.179 
see it and I still need to hook up my

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:23.789 
see it and I still need to hook up my
reset<00:07:22.779> line<00:07:22.989> for<00:07:23.319> every<00:07:23.469> time<00:07:23.649> a<00:07:23.679> new

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:23.799 
reset line for every time a new

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:26.369 
reset line for every time a new
character<00:07:24.189> comes<00:07:24.519> through<00:07:24.819> but<00:07:25.719> um<00:07:25.929> that's

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379 
character comes through but um that's

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.799 
character comes through but um that's
still<00:07:26.709> a<00:07:26.739> work<00:07:27.009> in<00:07:27.039> progress<00:07:27.429> and<00:07:27.849> I'll<00:07:27.999> figure
