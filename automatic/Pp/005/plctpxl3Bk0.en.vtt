00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
because it's cheaper you can also do

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.410 
because it's cheaper you can also do
other<00:01:00.600> ones<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.969> persians<00:01:02.969> probably<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
other ones but persians probably the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.979 
get any closer he will
so<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.290> makes<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.680> little<00:02:11.799> bit<00:02:11.980> harder<00:02:12.430> so

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
so that makes it a little bit harder so

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.190 
so that makes it a little bit harder so
I've<00:02:13.989> advanced<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.739> futile<00:02:15.010> age<00:02:15.989> Daniel<00:02:16.989> should

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
I've advanced a futile age Daniel should

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.839 
I've advanced a futile age Daniel should
already<00:02:17.409> be<00:02:17.530> there<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.430> he<00:02:18.519> should<00:02:18.760> be

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
already be there and he should be

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.289 
already be there and he should be
producing<00:02:19.360> archers<00:02:19.989> soon<00:02:20.290> but<00:02:20.970> what<00:02:21.970> stinks

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
producing archers soon but what stinks

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.479 
producing archers soon but what stinks
about<00:02:22.480> his<00:02:23.049> rush<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.769> he's<00:02:23.920> going<00:02:24.129> against<00:02:24.430> a

about his rush is he's going against a
golf<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.360> Goths<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.349> make<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> bunch<00:02:26.739> of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
golf and Goths like to make a bunch of

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.330 
golf and Goths like to make a bunch of
towers<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.879> their<00:02:28.090> only<00:02:28.269> defense<00:02:29.340> so
