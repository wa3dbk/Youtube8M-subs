well<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.560> key<00:03:34.799> thing<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.220> was<00:03:35.370> looking

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
well the key thing that I was looking

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.520 
well the key thing that I was looking
for<00:03:35.909> was<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.299> see<00:03:36.569> if<00:03:36.840> she<00:03:37.110> was<00:03:37.290> going<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
for was to see if she was going to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.860 
for was to see if she was going to
recover<00:03:37.890> from<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.670> punch<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.150> she<00:03:39.360> took

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
recover from the punch that she took

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.410 
recover from the punch that she took
I<00:03:39.900> watched<00:03:40.440> her<00:03:40.620> very<00:03:40.830> closely<00:03:41.160> she<00:03:41.910> staggered

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
I watched her very closely she staggered

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.130 
I watched her very closely she staggered
she<00:03:43.230> never<00:03:44.040> made<00:03:44.340> eye<00:03:44.370> contact<00:03:44.489> with<00:03:45.239> me<00:03:45.420> so

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
she never made eye contact with me so

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.650 
she never made eye contact with me so
safety<00:03:46.739> comes<00:03:46.980> first<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.640> that's<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.390> reason

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
safety comes first and that's the reason

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.539 
safety comes first and that's the reason
why<00:03:48.780> stuff<00:03:49.019> as<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> shot<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.739> temple<00:03:49.950> wasn't

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
why stuff as a shot to the temple wasn't

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.710 
why stuff as a shot to the temple wasn't
it<00:03:50.640> that's<00:03:50.760> why<00:03:50.940> your<00:03:51.120> legs<00:03:51.269> are<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:51.540> from
