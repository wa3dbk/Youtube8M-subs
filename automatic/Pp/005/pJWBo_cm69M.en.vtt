00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.779
 guide to the disastrous tournament 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.269
 venerable gold let's see how 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:15.059
 beat late underneath one of the three 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 meters then the team that I use 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 she is composed of the young explains 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.410
 deadly of a scary crate and a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 wide of the jungle 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.160
 so we will start with the young 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.160
 explains we put a chromosome there 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.900
 then we will put a pressure shot 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900
 blinding 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.210
 me 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.470
 and behind to make a small injury 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 piercing you so there normally at 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.440
 next turn must use his crack 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500
 death so not to lose two rounds 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 we're going to put the crappy crate 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:04.640
 here is the creepy cash we go 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 make a small storm back 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:23.299
 then a baneful curse and there we 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.210
 gets itx on the art of the jungle so 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.530
 is actually the tank of the group that has 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.149
 power tank and with so long consumer 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.149
 to put a shot of the acid 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.530
 so we bury it 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.340
 and that's the second rule 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.780
 so is there if he had to pretend it the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.970
 dead who was supported will use them 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.180
 immediately we will put ourselves in a 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.370
 little look he finally not all of 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 following since we ashton in contracts 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.230
 gone there it's really out of luck 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 because here he's going to reuse his crack 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.240
 death so what are we going to do is 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.540
 we're going to get new lakes 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.540
 creepy 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.900
 for matt a storm das like that one 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.900
 finish the pen behind that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:42.180
 then a cursed curse a 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
 agony 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.070
 after we get home the young man explains deadly 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 still in violent poison 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.460
 the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.460
 then a wound piercing you 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.810
 and a small wooden cross zone and 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:29.110
 party favors will let play that is to say the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:33.300
 next turn and here we beat tarbes 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.300
