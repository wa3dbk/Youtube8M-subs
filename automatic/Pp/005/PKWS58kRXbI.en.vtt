the gate and talk about some of the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.540 
the gate and talk about some of the
important<00:00:46.870> features<00:00:47.020> of<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:48.040> swimming<00:00:48.370> pool

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
important features of a swimming pool

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.880 
important features of a swimming pool
fence<00:00:48.910> gate<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:50.469> right

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
fence gate all right

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.240 
fence gate all right
this<00:00:51.309> fence<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.910> 48<00:00:52.629> inches<00:00:52.930> tall<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.530> if<00:00:54.160> you

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
this fence is 48 inches tall and if you

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.100 
this fence is 48 inches tall and if you
take<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.489> look<00:00:54.730> at<00:00:54.850> this<00:00:55.030> latch<00:00:55.360> here<00:00:55.840> which<00:00:55.989> is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
take a look at this latch here which is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.040 
take a look at this latch here which is
a<00:00:56.140> magnetic<00:00:56.850> latch<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:58.450> can<00:00:58.600> see<00:00:58.750> that<00:00:58.930> it

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
a magnetic latch you can see that it

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.610 
a magnetic latch you can see that it
does<00:00:59.289> extend<00:00:59.860> above<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.399> top<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.850> fence

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
does extend above the top of the fence

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.219 
does extend above the top of the fence
the<00:01:02.620> latch<00:01:03.460> does<00:01:03.820> need<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.059> be<00:01:04.180> 54<00:01:04.750> inches<00:01:05.049> off

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
the latch does need to be 54 inches off

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.559 
the latch does need to be 54 inches off
the<00:01:05.259> ground<00:01:05.649> by<00:01:06.100> code<00:01:06.460> that's<00:01:07.000> why<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.240> does

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:07.569 
the ground by code that's why I does

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:11.690 
the ground by code that's why I does
this<00:01:07.779> and<00:01:08.249> another<00:01:09.249> feature<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:10.179> gate<00:01:10.749> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this and another feature of this gate is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.169 
this and another feature of this gate is
that<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.880> latch<00:01:13.149> needs<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.079> be<00:01:14.670> self<00:01:15.670> latching

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
that the latch needs to be self latching

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.209 
that the latch needs to be self latching
so<00:01:16.959> we<00:01:17.950> open<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.279> gate<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.509> gate<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:21.009> latch

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
so we open the gate the gate the latch

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.029 
so we open the gate the gate the latch
needs<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.819> self<00:01:22.090> last<00:01:22.389> just<00:01:22.749> like<00:01:22.810> that<00:01:23.079> ok

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
needs to self last just like that ok

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.190 
needs to self last just like that ok
another<00:01:24.310> important<00:01:24.789> feature<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.119> pool<00:01:25.899> fence

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
another important feature of pool fence

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.469 
another important feature of pool fence
gates<00:01:26.560> excuse<00:01:27.549> me<00:01:27.670> while<00:01:27.819> I<00:01:27.849> get<00:01:27.969> this<00:01:28.179> ready

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
gates excuse me while I get this ready

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.639 
gates excuse me while I get this ready
is<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:29.529> day<00:01:29.829> swing<00:01:30.579> out<00:01:30.789> away<00:01:31.509> from<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.499> pool

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
is that day swing out away from the pool

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.589 
is that day swing out away from the pool
they<00:01:32.979> have<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.369> swing<00:01:33.609> away<00:01:34.060> from<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.389> pool

00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:34.599 
they have to swing away from the pool

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.529 
they have to swing away from the pool
that's<00:01:35.049> critical<00:01:35.619> will<00:01:36.549> not<00:01:36.729> pass<00:01:36.969> code<00:01:37.270> if<00:01:37.419> it

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
that's critical will not pass code if it

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.510 
that's critical will not pass code if it
does<00:01:37.659> not<00:01:37.840> swing<00:01:38.109> away<00:01:38.229> from<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:38.499> pool<00:01:38.679> last

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
does not swing away from the pool last

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.159 
does not swing away from the pool last
thing<00:01:39.789> on<00:01:39.939> a<00:01:39.969> pool<00:01:40.209> fence<00:01:40.450> gate<00:01:40.659> is<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:40.990> needs

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:41.169 
thing on a pool fence gate is it needs

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:42.319 
thing on a pool fence gate is it needs
to<00:01:41.349> self<00:01:41.649> closed

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to self closed

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.279 
to self closed
okay<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:44.109> pool<00:01:44.679> fence<00:01:44.979> gates<00:01:45.419> need<00:01:46.419> to<00:01:46.659> swing

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
okay so pool fence gates need to swing

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.010 
okay so pool fence gates need to swing
away<00:01:47.529> from<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.009> pool<00:01:48.279> self<00:01:49.029> closed<00:01:49.359> and<00:01:49.689> self

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
away from the pool self closed and self

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.010 
away from the pool self closed and self
latch<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:51.399> latch<00:01:51.999> does<00:01:52.359> need<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.569> be<00:01:52.689> fifty

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
latch the latch does need to be fifty

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.319 
latch the latch does need to be fifty
four<00:01:53.200> inches<00:01:53.380> off<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.590> ground<00:01:54.299> minimum

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329

that's Nationwide Building Code some
areas<00:01:57.520> may<00:01:58.169> require<00:01:59.169> more<00:01:59.950> height<00:02:00.189> or<00:02:00.489> even

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
areas may require more height or even

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.049 
areas may require more height or even
more<00:02:01.059> restrictions<00:02:02.020> than<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.759> can<00:02:03.789> see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:04.059 
more restrictions than this you can see

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:06.569 
more restrictions than this you can see
that<00:02:04.239> the<00:02:04.450> fence<00:02:05.169> ties<00:02:05.499> in<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.219> garage

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
that the fence ties in with this garage

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.260 
that the fence ties in with this garage
okay<00:02:07.569> then<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.709> goes<00:02:09.220> back<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.729> garage<00:02:09.940> and

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
okay then it goes back to the garage and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.319

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
go with the 48 inch fence simply so we

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.920 
go with the 48 inch fence simply so we
