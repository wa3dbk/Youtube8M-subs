00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 the best and it was the best bodywork 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.320

 of course for 40 years 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.570
 completely transformed the most modern 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.430
 materials 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:30.170
 electronic systems and cockpit assistants 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.170
 still driver oriented 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.630
 Now touring called touring 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.700
 no one raises any questions 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.480
 but initially its release is not planned 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 I was very you homo 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 it happened let's say so on family 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 circumstances I had a daughter when 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.180
 we went on vacation we always had 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.550
 problem with things they didn't fit in 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.710
 trunk treshki usual and since I 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.180
 bodies engaged in it struck me as 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.310
 why not make your own 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.650
 station wagon 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.840
 Especially since I wanted to continue to ride on 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.959
 BMW company at the time 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.940
 wagon was not and therefore in April 84 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.100
 years, I began to think that for this you can 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.990
 make and came up with move the back 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.790
 rack and lengthen the roof 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.690
 I already have an image to my head 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.660
 formed and small background for many 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.820
 BMW 3 Series was and is not easy 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.170
 vehicle but also a symbol 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.270
 lifestyle 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.270
 but for collectors the object of passion 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.720

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.280
 in the latest version of treshki compared to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.920
