00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 as bob would say after a sorry appearance 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.710
 wise and seriously political 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 cross problems of the blow that intrigues me and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 jacques the connectors of microphones are 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 a little julien vanni not why not me 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:29.189
 My name is that at the beginning of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:33.570
 play it normally I can be really 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:44.820
 would vote early that he gave himself trouble 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 of guys a bird to eat I read with 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 I'd bet even when I had 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 on big buildings and all that is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.629
 just architecturally but ok 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 the course it was not bad that you 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 makes you want to re my little test for 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.090
 to be a link in the description to if 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090
 I'm thinking about it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.409
 to the video of my old lover I 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 also does on the subject of standards 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.040
 watering 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.090
 it's gone 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.000
 diop or so the 7th stewardship and health 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.950
 in general 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 finally for the normal and reassembled his 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.870
 platforms the rise to the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.870
 area 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:39.820
 not a single fault maybe not due the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.820
 say because I feel that I see myself where 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.759
 my eyes widen no big case 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.590
 but that's how it's done 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.149
 like that we do my day I am 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.149
 almost I am brasc the supras this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.410
 no no no I blew in my hand 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.470
 but in fact it's a very early thing 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.760
 no no no no no no no I return 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.140
 from where I was playing more faux pas for 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.750
 stop ice cream 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.090
 understand I go back to the small gp 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.540
 ellipses so I got in 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510
 creative here and that's it at least I get you 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 shows more than no it's not what 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.760
 make me redo everything take laurel 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.890
 perfect for twenty minutes of 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:59.720
 a little nasty course is severe on 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:03:03.350
 early and then chorus other stuff 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.910
 it was crashing goes through the pass by 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:35.680
 there we go when we do what by the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:35.680
 perla the canvas top to a clepsydre 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.910
 excerpt of agreement where is the guy does not have 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.799
 finished his map what big low he told us 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.579
 that he appreciates he will really appreciate 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.370
 let's say sat ap 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.330
 I'll do right now or ccc 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.220
 does not have who is really 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.660
 pretty really pretty who is very faithful 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:07.660
 at play and yeah he would make it enjoy 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:11.000
 because there are so-called 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.350
 block commands to put some 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.450
 checkpoints on his map it could be 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.000
 really really helpful to some 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.840
 moments like but not right now and 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.769
 that would allow us to at least 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.300
 respect the deadline respected the map in 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.580
 terms of checkpoint because there one 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.970
 go back almost where you want 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.750
 so 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.310
 so this is our era is very cool good 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.560
 well listen to one the next update 1 I think 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.440
 that as soon as he goes out I'll try to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:46.780
 keep informed and we beat France 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.680
 seems to listen listen to listen 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.960
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 still not a little green thumb 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.620
 will favor a comment to tell us 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.120
 what you thought tomorrow times 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.920
 I do the best I can because 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.860
 must know that to make a video 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.570
 commented joking it's really 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.910
 meaning it's really technical 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.630
 because it's been a long time since I 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.310
 do I have filmed it must feel 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.080
 level of speech but in order to 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.020
 make videos regularly actually 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.880
 for this plan well be comfortable with 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:22.430
 with take cloud public viewer rather good 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.390
 I mean to the next subscribers 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.310
 of the chain if you are still not 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.730
 a favorite fold what strikes me on 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.620
 a comment to the support tell me what 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.240
 you thought of this tablecloth 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.070
 from pleasure to know too is it 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.840
 that you have thought about them especially 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.270
 mirror's edge players it's to be 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.870
 really nice to know 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:47.479
 good go good as I can not 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:50.479
 stop me from finishing in style 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.160
 a few will do something a little 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.360
 little tnt in the phase of these 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.650
 buildings that's true plus these 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.700
 buildings are really well arranged 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.590
 so we do not see the limits of 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.360
 map 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.419
 thing that there was my think the author 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.780
 really really really pretty 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:09.230
 frankly 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.230
 we are rebels hop it's gone 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:33.690
 quality does not know unhappy 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:40.740
 here with michel place and find me 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:43.740
 no master by samurai here is 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:51.800
 how honest I am it is a player 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:53.790
 hurts we're going to ruin this tablecloth 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.150
 it's not my style it's really not 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.150
 my genre 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.460
 so beautiful it's like crushed 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:12.070
 passers-by on gt1 it's bad but we like 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:16.410
 so much to do it I was at the centro the 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.410
 keeping gt5 that is not going by the exit 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.450
 here is a 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.210
 next time will do the whole map this 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.860
 could be an idea that the tnt in 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.930
 each of the buildings in the map why 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.970
 not those who pass a little simple but 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.980
 it's so tired we see the costs 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.730
 i mean next time we 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.240
 got dressed rather sexy go to the 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.810
 next 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.370
 wear well and and baba for the 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.320
 umpteenth time next 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.320
 hi to all the scenarios
