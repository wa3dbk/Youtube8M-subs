00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everybody is a double clutch luca 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.130
 this is the presentation of the shoe 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.130
 jordan apple tree is the time 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.920
 as always we start from 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.990
 cushioning that in this shoe is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 one of the main features e 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.030
 most important indeed adopts the same 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.090
 scheme the same amortization of the 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.950
 jordan twilight or 28 that for those who don't 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.620
 remember it is that shoe that is 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.390
 went a lot in 2013 was used 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.260
 especially from ray allen who has 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 practically a top part 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.579
 of the upper which is an ankle boot and with the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.769
 you certainly recognize the zipper 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.179
 in short, we have in the back 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.940
 also in the front one 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.609
 of the midsole an air purse 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 or zoomer is inserted precisely in the 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.929
 mission is that we can hear 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 very much also thanks to the flight plate 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.010
 of jordan brand that we will see later in the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.629
 support section for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.179
 regarding the materials of the upper 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.569
 we have the classic in neoprene briefs 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.510
 which is at the bottom of the shoe 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.390
 and enel in the outer part we have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 this synthetic leather that covers everything 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 the therefore all the upper that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.880
 at the beginning maybe it is a bit hard but 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 however, by playing in it yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.820
 softens and above all thanks to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 these cuts at the level of the laces yes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.300
 allows to have lines after 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.820
 bending that we do absolutely 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.820
 forget about having the shoe on the foot 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.350
 regarding the fit the shoe 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.090
 westerhout size therefore of the same 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.130
 size with which we regularly go with 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.109
 the other shoes with regard to the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.630
 support we have at the sole level 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.909
 the jordan flight plate that it is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.759
 also used in the Jordan superfly 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.459
 up but in this shoe as in yours 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.649
 eni and therefore in the 28 is constituted in 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.539
 carbon fiber and is divided into three 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.420
 completely separate portions that is 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.299
 and so we coupled a plate 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.239
 rear one central and one in the van 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.739
 foot and that gives us a maxim 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.200
 bending at the part level 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.629
 front of the foot and also allows us 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.610
 to fully feel the zoom and to of 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.349
 nike regarding support 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.870
 at the top of the shoe 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.549
 therefore in the for in the upper we have a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.340
 cut quite high at the level of the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.379
 cabin is very comfortable and 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 especially thanks to this skin that 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.970
 however it is not very very soft and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.920
 we have the support you feel 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.680
 side level 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.349
 not to forget even the boss or the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.650
 counter that is nothing but this piece 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.650
 of tpu put in this case outside 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.349
 of the shoe that gives support e 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.049
 above all it blocks serves to block the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.120
 back of the foot in the moment 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.609
 of the transition then the roll 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.989
 of the foot on the foot van like 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.910
 final considerations 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.099
 well this is dinner here 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.840
 tenth signed on carmelo anthony 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.549
 quinn of one of the best players 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.930
 jordan brand adopts the lower part 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.180
 used in jordan its born as 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.870
 we said before is therefore a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.090
 absolutely oiled technology e 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.170
 is that it was judged among the best 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 of 2013 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.250
 at the level of performance and an upper 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 as we have seen before 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.700
 initially quite rigid but 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.530
 however playing with it in time 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.180
 it softens for the rest we can 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.060
 to say that it is still a very shoe 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.890
