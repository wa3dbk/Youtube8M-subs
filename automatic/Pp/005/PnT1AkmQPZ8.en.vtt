00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 so call we have here the c2 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.130
 and the pony championat is outside beer 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.260
 Blessing could be extremely many small ponies 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.030
 belong at 14 o'clock and at a quarter before 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 two years ago got the message that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 first pony champion art is easier 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.330
 Well, I see quite the must have out 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 I tried with my clothes 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 rauszubekommen the maximum of over 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 Hoping to cross the finish line 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.560
 I will not have any chances here 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.960
 are many trained bodies or almost 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.309
 and I just want you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 the first impression of this round 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.149
 give about this championate and hope 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 that I can help you with that a bit 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.550
 I had no idea the campina 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 Times are generally from the ponies 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.550
 go championat within a radius displayed in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 five minutes 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 Now everyone is storming and wanting to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:56.129
 sign up but yes I hope that sees 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.079
 Chic and star, that's me 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.600
 I will not have a chance but I suppose 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.250
 That's not it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 more, there are also free to say I 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 stop 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.600
 the video is champion and I leave 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 Now time to pass and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 so that you can see everyone right away 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.110
 yes the last few seconds is here 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.790
 I'm not the start line here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 but it is always drawn when we 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.070
 riding there means stop us 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.049
 leaves the competition group that is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.680
 here is always the start line now too 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.270
 if we are not marked 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 20 seconds only the first pony 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.820
 I am a championat in stars table online 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.579
 I'm of course a pauli fan I am 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.930
 now just a bit excited 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.520
 it would certainly be packed full 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 right yes 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.539
 over there with the registrations now 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 The groups are always created in 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.090
 one in there i hope the one is mine 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.090
 not angry now 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:14.690
 Yes, we wait until the competition group 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.519
 is created Eppelborn probably are 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.390
 you are too late or you just hate 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.390
 a completely done so 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:30.829

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:37.700

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.120
 countdown 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.720
 the start line seems to be there 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.630
 that is very strange they have 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 probably wrong 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.319
 they will have to fix that 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.579

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.430
