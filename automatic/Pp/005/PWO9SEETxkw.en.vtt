00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
part there's going to be a few towers

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.419 
part there's going to be a few towers
here<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.319> don't<00:00:07.319> know<00:00:07.410> why<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.620> swap<00:00:08.099> off<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
here I don't know why I swap off the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.709 
here I don't know why I swap off the
panzer<00:00:08.790> shank<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:09.120> you're<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.660> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
panzer shank because you're going to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.299 
panzer shank because you're going to
need<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> panzer<00:00:10.380> shank<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.800> second<00:00:11.130> here

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
need the panzer shank in a second here

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.270 
need the panzer shank in a second here
so<00:00:11.660> you<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:12.929> ammo<00:00:13.200> ammo<00:00:13.380> from<00:00:13.799> last<00:00:14.070> time

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
so you have any ammo ammo from last time

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.390 
so you have any ammo ammo from last time
don't<00:00:15.089> swap<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.949> I'm<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.250> I'm<00:00:17.369> just

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
don't swap it off I'm just I'm just

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
don't swap it off I'm just I'm just
going<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> pick<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.930> over

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
going to pick up that one you see over

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.400 
going to pick up that one you see over
there<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.350> second<00:00:19.730> anyway<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.410> they're

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
there in a second anyway so they're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.349 
there in a second anyway so they're
they're<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.160> these<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.699> sniper

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
they're going to be these like sniper

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.349 
they're going to be these like sniper
towers<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.080> guess<00:00:25.400> that<00:00:26.400> you're<00:00:27.000> gonna<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
towers I guess that you're gonna have to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.429 
towers I guess that you're gonna have to
take<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> rocket<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:29.929> grab<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> Panzer

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
take out with a rocket so grab a Panzer

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.610 
take out with a rocket so grab a Panzer
shank<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> those<00:00:34.110> areas<00:00:34.500> in

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
shank and this is one of those areas in

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.600 
shank and this is one of those areas in
the<00:00:34.710> game<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> keep<00:00:35.460> moving

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the game where you have to keep moving

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.490 
the game where you have to keep moving
forward<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.360> else<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.809> enemies<00:00:37.170> just

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
forward or else the at enemies just

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
forward or else the at enemies just
continually<00:00:38.309> respawning<00:00:39.000> you'll<00:00:39.149> get

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
continually respawning you'll get

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.799 
continually respawning you'll get
nowhere<00:00:40.040> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.480> respawn

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
nowhere so I don't know if they respawn

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.400 
nowhere so I don't know if they respawn
in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> towers<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.899> like<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.930> blow<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.350> up

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
in the towers but I like to blow them up

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
in the towers but I like to blow them up
anyway<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> case<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> move<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850

anyway just in case so move off to the
right<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> lot<00:00:51.840> of

aren't burning watch out because if an

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
aren't burning watch out because if an
enemy<00:00:59.219> gets<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.670> grenade<00:01:00.000> beer<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
enemy gets a grenade beer and it's a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.179 
enemy gets a grenade beer and it's a
bomb<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:04.159> just<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.400> cover<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.299> um

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
bomb so just take cover back here um

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
bomb so just take cover back here um
there's<00:01:08.189> tons<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> cover<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
there's tons of cover here so it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.940 
there's tons of cover here so it
shouldn't<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.619> problem<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.950> pretty

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
shouldn't really be a problem and pretty

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
shouldn't really be a problem and pretty
much<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.850> you'll<00:01:15.240> notice<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.720> throw<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
much that you'll notice they throw a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
much that you'll notice they throw a
bunch<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> grenades<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.460> close

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
bunch of grenades just if you're close

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600 
bunch of grenades just if you're close
enough<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.060> throw<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.460> most<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
enough to throw them back but most of

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
enough to throw them back but most of
the<00:01:20.670> cover<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.420> anyway<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:22.320> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the cover here is good anyway so if it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
the cover here is good anyway so if it's
if<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> grenade<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.549> behind<00:01:24.180> cover<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> your

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
if the grenade is behind cover and your

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
if the grenade is behind cover and your
kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> behind<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.570> grenade<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
kind of behind if the grenade is the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
kind of behind if the grenade is the
high<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> cover<00:01:30.509> between<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
high if there's a cover between you and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
high if there's a cover between you and
grenade<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.939> grenade<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.689> hurt

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
grenade then the grenade will not hurt

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.060 
grenade then the grenade will not hurt
you<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.350> long<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.790> cover

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
you as long as it's good cover

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.560 
you as long as it's good cover
so<00:01:37.990> keep<00:01:38.990> moving<00:01:39.290> up<00:01:39.409> on<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.620> right

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
so keep moving up on the right

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.670 
so keep moving up on the right
eventually<00:01:41.570> you'll<00:01:41.750> hit<00:01:41.930> one<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.620> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
eventually you'll hit one of the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.950 
eventually you'll hit one of the
triggers<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:43.070> makes<00:01:44.000> your<00:01:44.120> allies<00:01:44.510> move<00:01:44.780> up

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
triggers that makes your allies move up

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.080 
triggers that makes your allies move up
and<00:01:45.110> makes<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.590> infinite<00:01:46.040> enemy<00:01:46.700> stop

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
and makes the infinite enemy stop

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.520 
and makes the infinite enemy stop
spawning<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:53.119> keep<00:01:53.869> around<00:01:54.140> your

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
spawning and so keep around your

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.260 
spawning and so keep around your
single-shot<00:01:55.190> rifle<00:01:56.740> whether<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.890> be<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
single-shot rifle whether it be the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.900 
single-shot rifle whether it be the
mosin<00:01:59.270> nagant<00:01:59.360> or<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.960> jouvert<00:02:00.550> like<00:02:01.550> i<00:02:01.700> have

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
mosin nagant or the jouvert like i have

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:13.020 
mosin nagant or the jouvert like i have
here<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.179> keep<00:02:08.420> killing<00:02:08.990> bitches<00:02:09.170> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.449 

after<00:02:14.030> otros<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.540> say<00:02:14.950> shit<00:02:16.390> um<00:02:17.470> oh<00:02:18.470> yeah

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
after otros and say shit um oh yeah

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.590 
after otros and say shit um oh yeah
there's<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.700> lot<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:19.940> stuff<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.480> be

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
there's a lot of stuff that can be

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.540 
there's a lot of stuff that can be
really<00:02:20.870> easily<00:02:21.230> shot<00:02:21.590> during<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:21.950> level<00:02:22.310> so

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
really easily shot during this level so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.540 
really easily shot during this level so
make<00:02:23.300> good<00:02:23.510> use<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.959> like<00:02:24.459> pretty<00:02:25.459> much

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
make good use of it like pretty much

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.460 
make good use of it like pretty much
anything<00:02:25.790> that's<00:02:26.180> wood<00:02:26.750> that's<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
anything that's wood that's like a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.479 
anything that's wood that's like a
pallet<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.730> be<00:02:28.850> shot<00:02:29.090> through<00:02:29.830> or<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> think

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
pallet can be shot through or I think

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.310 
pallet can be shot through or I think
barrels<00:02:31.880> as<00:02:32.060> well<00:02:32.269> can<00:02:32.600> be<00:02:32.720> shot<00:02:32.930> through<00:02:33.170> but

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
barrels as well can be shot through but

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.540 
barrels as well can be shot through but
not<00:02:33.500> sure

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.440 

so<00:02:38.270> keep<00:02:38.570> moving<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:40.060> there<00:02:41.060> should<00:02:41.270> be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
so keep moving up and there should be

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.950 
so keep moving up and there should be
guys<00:02:41.600> hiding<00:02:41.990> behind<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.520> trucks<00:02:43.810> they<00:02:44.810> can

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
guys hiding behind the trucks they can

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.000 
guys hiding behind the trucks they can
be<00:02:45.080> really<00:02:45.470> easily<00:02:45.800> shot<00:02:46.160> considering<00:02:46.940> that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
be really easily shot considering that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.980 
be really easily shot considering that
they<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.310> seen<00:02:49.580> under<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.000> trucks<00:02:50.360> so

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
they can be seen under the trucks so

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.430 
they can be seen under the trucks so
keep<00:02:51.290> moving<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:52.540> use<00:02:53.540> your<00:02:53.660> panzer<00:02:54.050> shank<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
keep moving up use your panzer shank to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.500 
keep moving up use your panzer shank to
take<00:02:54.590> out<00:02:54.770> any<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> towers<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.380> um

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
take out any of the towers you see um

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.840 
take out any of the towers you see um
and<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.830> there's<00:03:01.190> going<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.400> be<00:03:01.460> this<00:03:01.520> big

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
and so there's going to be this big

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.580 
and so there's going to be this big
fence<00:03:02.330> you're<00:03:02.690> gonna<00:03:02.810> want<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.080> move<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.380> on

they don't respawn in that tower up

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.210 
they don't respawn in that tower up
there<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:06.440> there's<00:04:06.709> still<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> guy<00:04:07.100> up

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
there but if there's still a guy up

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.820 
there but if there's still a guy up
there<00:04:07.370> or<00:04:07.550> recommend<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.030> blow<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.360> up

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
there or recommend you blow it up

there or recommend you blow it up
so<00:04:10.830> this<00:04:11.069> part<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.610> be<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.790> little<00:04:12.090> bit

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
so this part can be a little bit

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.330 
so this part can be a little bit
challenging<00:04:12.720> there's<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.990> big<00:04:13.350> kind<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.100> Bunker

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
challenging there's a big kind of Bunker

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.650 
challenging there's a big kind of Bunker
up<00:04:15.200> no<00:04:16.200> not<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> bunker<00:04:16.799> like<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.250> guess<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.389> Hut

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
up no not a bunker like I guess a Hut

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.120 
up no not a bunker like I guess a Hut
off<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.410> right<00:04:19.590> there<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.889> there's<00:04:20.010> gonna

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
off of the right there and there's gonna
