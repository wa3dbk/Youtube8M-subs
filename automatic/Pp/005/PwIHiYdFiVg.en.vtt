cheat get some bone meal and boom you
get<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> huge<00:00:43.559> tree<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.629> tree<00:00:46.579> looks

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
get a huge tree so this tree looks

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
get a huge tree so this tree looks
pretty<00:00:47.850> awesome<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.510> opinion<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
pretty awesome in my opinion that is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.790 
pretty awesome in my opinion that is
probably<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> coolest<00:00:50.460> tree<00:00:51.120> I've<00:00:51.239> ever<00:00:51.329> seen

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
probably the coolest tree I've ever seen

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.189 
probably the coolest tree I've ever seen
but<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:53.100> uh<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.840> see<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.050> looks

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
but let's uh let's see what it looks

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
but let's uh let's see what it looks
like<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> inside<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> make

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
like on the inside so when you make

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
like on the inside so when you make
custom<00:00:58.350> trees<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.190> good<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.489> making

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
custom trees it's not as good as making

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
custom trees it's not as good as making
a<00:00:59.879> forest<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:00.870> reasons<00:01:01.289> as<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.219> see

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
a forest for some reasons as you can see

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
a forest for some reasons as you can see
here<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.870> let<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> better<00:01:04.920> view

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
here or here let me get a better view

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.330 
here or here let me get a better view
there<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> hollow<00:01:06.479> inside<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.250> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
there is not a hollow inside so when you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
there is not a hollow inside so when you
make<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> tree<00:01:09.330> by<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.080> tree<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.770> not

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
make a tree by just a tree like not

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.600 
make a tree by just a tree like not
making<00:01:11.400> multiple<00:01:12.060> trees<00:01:12.900> at<00:01:13.049> once<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.610> forest

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
making multiple trees at once or forest

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.690 
making multiple trees at once or forest
you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.140> hollow<00:01:16.770> inside<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you don't get a hollow inside so you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.870 
you don't get a hollow inside so you
can't<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.570> fun<00:01:18.869> inside<00:01:19.490> but<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.700> does

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
can't like have fun inside but it does

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
can't like have fun inside but it does
make<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.630> cool<00:01:21.990> awesome<00:01:22.320> tree<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
make this really cool awesome tree and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.840 
make this really cool awesome tree and
if<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:23.880> playing<00:01:24.090> single<00:01:24.689> player<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
if you're playing single player you can

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
if you're playing single player you can
mine<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.930> take<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
mine all that if you want to take you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440 
mine all that if you want to take you
make<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.590> diamond<00:01:28.770> block<00:01:29.159> tree<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.790> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
make like a diamond block tree if you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
make like a diamond block tree if you
really<00:01:30.780> wanted<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.280> that's<00:01:32.280> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> cheating

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
really wanted to that's kind of cheating

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.350 
really wanted to that's kind of cheating
but<00:01:33.299> oh<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.920> we're<00:01:35.369> gonna<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.670> invade

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
but oh well so now we're gonna go invade

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
but oh well so now we're gonna go invade
this<00:01:36.930> snow<00:01:37.380> biome<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:39.229> let's<00:01:40.229> make<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> forest

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this snow biome and let's make a forest

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
this snow biome and let's make a forest
out<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> all<00:01:41.310> those<00:01:41.520> trees<00:01:41.970> looking<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
out of all those trees looking like that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.960 
out of all those trees looking like that
so<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.950> got<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> stake<00:01:44.939> your

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so what you got to need to do stake your

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
so what you got to need to do stake your
obsidia<00:01:45.979> place<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.220> down<00:01:47.540> take<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.689> wool

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
obsidia place one on down take your wool

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
obsidia place one on down take your wool
which<00:01:49.740> were<00:01:50.009> your<00:01:50.430> logs<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.600> mine<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> brown

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
which were your logs but mine is brown
