00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
his knee on the club and I gave up my 75

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.900 
his knee on the club and I gave up my 75
I<00:03:30.970> truly<00:03:31.840> believe<00:03:32.230> hit<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.530> search<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.890> 75<00:03:33.250> so

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
I truly believe hit the search of 75 so

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.850 
I truly believe hit the search of 75 so
I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.420> spring<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.080> reading<00:03:35.380> frame<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
I think spring the reading frame and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.360 
I think spring the reading frame and
then<00:03:35.980> we<00:03:36.130> have<00:03:36.510> satco<00:03:37.510> i<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:38.980> gonna<00:03:39.130> be<00:03:39.340> a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
then we have satco i think is gonna be a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.539 
then we have satco i think is gonna be a
setting<00:03:39.670> for<00:03:39.820> striker<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.320> it<00:03:42.100> looks<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
setting for striker so it looks like a

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.250 
setting for striker so it looks like a
pretty<00:03:42.910> amazing<00:03:43.329> plane<00:03:43.690> then<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.079> have

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
pretty amazing plane then we have

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.780 
pretty amazing plane then we have
balance<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.010> went<00:03:45.190> too<00:03:45.400> much<00:03:45.579> on

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
balance I think I went too much on

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.740 
balance I think I went too much on
valencia<00:03:46.390> by<00:03:47.049> game<00:03:47.290> on<00:03:47.470> my<00:03:47.590> 78<00:03:48.100> i<00:03:48.640> think<00:03:49.180> if<00:03:49.510> he

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
valencia by game on my 78 i think if he

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.289 
valencia by game on my 78 i think if he
gets<00:03:49.989> out<00:03:50.170> rated<00:03:50.590> he's<00:03:50.680> gonna<00:03:50.920> be<00:03:51.130> at<00:03:51.220> 75<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.000> 76

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
gets out rated he's gonna be at 75 to 76

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.500 
gets out rated he's gonna be at 75 to 76
i<00:03:52.900> think<00:03:53.500> i<00:03:53.620> did<00:03:53.890> too<00:03:54.430> much<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.880> upgradable

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510

i think i did too much of a upgradable
to<00:03:55.690> him<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:57.130> probably<00:03:57.519> because<00:03:57.640> he<00:03:57.910> played

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150
