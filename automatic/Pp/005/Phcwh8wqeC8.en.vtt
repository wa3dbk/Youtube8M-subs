stands that are a little bit nicer than
the<00:00:20.939> centuries<00:00:21.939> in<00:00:22.240> my<00:00:22.449> opinion<00:00:22.900> they<00:00:23.170> have<00:00:23.320> a

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
the centuries in my opinion they have a

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.460 
the centuries in my opinion they have a
couple<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:23.800> nice<00:00:23.949> features<00:00:25.259> one<00:00:26.259> of<00:00:26.380> the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
couple of nice features one of the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.909 
couple of nice features one of the
features<00:00:26.859> that<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:28.419> ants<00:00:28.630> Co<00:00:28.929> has<00:00:29.169> is<00:00:29.589> it<00:00:29.769> has

camera it just clips on the side by 2
bolt<00:01:07.509> 2<00:01:07.780> screws<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.549> pretty<00:01:09.759> easy<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:10.150> do

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
bolt 2 screws it's pretty easy to do

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
bolt 2 screws it's pretty easy to do
it's<00:01:10.900> pretty<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.820> simple<00:01:13.210> design<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it's pretty pretty simple design the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.899 
it's pretty pretty simple design the
same<00:01:21.640> design<00:01:22.150> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.920> centuries<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> bit

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
same design on the centuries is a bit

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.090 
same design on the centuries is a bit
different<00:01:25.119> headings<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.320> side<00:01:26.500> here<00:01:27.009> it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
different headings on the side here it

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.240 
different headings on the side here it
is<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.509> little<00:01:28.600> bit<00:01:28.810> longer<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.070> can

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
is it's a little bit longer but you can

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.240 
is it's a little bit longer but you can
put<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:30.490> pieces<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.180> individually<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:33.009> this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
put the pieces in individually like this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.399 
put the pieces in individually like this
and<00:01:33.549> then<00:01:34.030> also<00:01:34.390> hangs<00:01:34.689> on<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.930> side<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
and then also hangs on the side of the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.660 
and then also hangs on the side of the
camera<00:01:35.619> off<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.729> 2<00:01:36.850> bolts<00:01:37.119> just<00:01:38.430> hangs<00:01:39.430> right

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
camera off of 2 bolts just hangs right

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.700 
camera off of 2 bolts just hangs right
on<00:01:39.909> there<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:41.409> easy

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.810 

this<00:01:46.710> studio<00:01:47.070> camera<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:49.340> basically<00:01:50.340> three

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this studio camera has basically three

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
this studio camera has basically three
standards<00:01:51.450> many<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.350> only<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.650> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
standards many of them only have the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
standards many of them only have the
front<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> rear<00:01:53.900> what<00:01:54.900> most<00:01:55.170> people

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
front and the rear what most people

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.270 
front and the rear what most people
don't<00:01:55.650> realize<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:59.479> this<00:02:00.479> moves<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:02.159> out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
don't realize is this moves in and out

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.399 
don't realize is this moves in and out
here<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.900> many<00:02:04.110> times<00:02:05.540> people<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> camera

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
here so many times people get the camera

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.639 
here so many times people get the camera
and<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.680> don't<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.759> also<00:02:09.090> moves<00:02:09.649> this

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and they don't know it also moves this

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.390 
and they don't know it also moves this
direction<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:14.420> little<00:02:15.420> bit<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> swing<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.400> little

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
direction a little bit of swing a little

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.800 
direction a little bit of swing a little
bit<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.790> tilt<00:02:20.630> comes<00:02:21.630> off<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> rotates<00:02:22.760> this

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
bit of tilt comes off the rotates this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.620 
bit of tilt comes off the rotates this
is<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> sliding<00:02:25.290> back<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.180> shoot<00:02:27.360> half

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
is a sliding back so you can shoot half

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.220 
is a sliding back so you can shoot half
of<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.840> 5x7<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.209> need<00:02:30.420> an<00:02:30.570> insert<00:02:30.930> in

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
of a 5x7 but you do need an insert in

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.770 
of a 5x7 but you do need an insert in
order<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:35.120> there's<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.300> back<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
order to do that there's the back of the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.320 
order to do that there's the back of the
ant's<00:02:37.050> goes<00:02:37.230> through<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.620> camera<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.940> is

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
ant's goes through your camera this is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
ant's goes through your camera this is
the<00:02:39.480> insert<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.380> need<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:41.820> shoot<00:02:42.830> half

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the insert that you need to shoot half

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.180 
the insert that you need to shoot half
of<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> 5x7

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
of a 5x7

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.880 
of a 5x7
this<00:02:47.190> actually<00:02:47.580> might<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> deer<00:02:48.300> door

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
this actually might be for a deer door

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
this actually might be for a deer door
with<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> idea<00:02:51.620> snaps<00:02:52.620> on<00:02:57.799> it<00:02:58.799> moves<00:02:59.160> left<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
with the idea snaps on it moves left and

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.620 
with the idea snaps on it moves left and
right<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:02.130> actually<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.610> bit<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.269> think

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
right it's actually this bit so I think

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.280 
right it's actually this bit so I think
I<00:03:03.690> should<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.880> there<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.910> go<00:03:06.290> watch

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
I should have it on there you go watch

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
I should have it on there you go watch
it<00:03:07.320> I'm<00:03:07.590> doing<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.489> can't<00:03:08.730> really<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.269> in

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
it I'm doing you can't really see it in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.890 
it I'm doing you can't really see it in
there<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:12.350> remember<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.769> 5<00:03:13.980> by<00:03:14.220> 7
