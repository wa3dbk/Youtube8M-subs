00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
away to the planet Earth that's pretty

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.259 
away to the planet Earth that's pretty
powerful<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.640> mean<00:02:14.790> she<00:02:14.910> has<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.209> her

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
powerful I mean she has to have her

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.910 
powerful I mean she has to have her
concentration<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.230> that's<00:02:16.319> still<00:02:16.620> pretty

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
concentration on but that's still pretty

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.610 
concentration on but that's still pretty
powerful<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:18.629> mean<00:02:18.810> if<00:02:18.930> she<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.349> wanted

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
powerful and I mean if she really wanted

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.290 
powerful and I mean if she really wanted
to<00:02:19.680> do<00:02:19.800> some<00:02:20.040> crazy<00:02:20.459> she<00:02:20.790> probably<00:02:21.000> could

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
to do some crazy she probably could

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.809 
to do some crazy she probably could
and<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.379> that's<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:23.220> when<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.580> comes<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
and so that's about it when it comes to

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.250 
and so that's about it when it comes to

at<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.830> exact<00:02:38.099> same<00:02:38.160> way<00:02:38.430> when<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.700> comes

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
at it the exact same way when it comes

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.789 
at it the exact same way when it comes
to<00:02:39.360> Jitsu<00:02:39.870> our<00:02:40.019> cause<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:40.530> really<00:02:40.769> a

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
to Jitsu our cause it's not really a

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.430 
to Jitsu our cause it's not really a
cooking<00:02:41.370> longa<00:02:41.819> or<00:02:41.940> anime<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> can't

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
cooking longa or anime and so I can't

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.259 
cooking longa or anime and so I can't
really<00:02:43.560> take<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:45.030> when<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
really take it like that but when it

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.240 
really take it like that but when it
comes<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> way<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> episode<00:02:46.410> was<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:47.069> just

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
comes to the way the episode was it just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
comes to the way the episode was it just
felt<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.970> drawn<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.870> spread

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
felt like it was drawn out and spread

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.229 
felt like it was drawn out and spread
thin<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.829> came<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> actual<00:02:50.370> plot<00:02:51.000> of
