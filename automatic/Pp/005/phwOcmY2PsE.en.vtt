lands<00:00:19.340> in<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.580> West<00:00:19.840> we've<00:00:20.840> been<00:00:21.020> working<00:00:21.200> on

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
lands in the West we've been working on

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.350 
lands in the West we've been working on
this<00:00:21.619> project<00:00:21.860> for<00:00:22.099> about<00:00:22.369> 18<00:00:22.820> months<00:00:23.060> and

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
this project for about 18 months and

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.749 
this project for about 18 months and
that<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:24.080> understand<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.009> science<00:00:25.490> and

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
that is to understand the science and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.729 
that is to understand the science and
the<00:00:25.820> best<00:00:26.029> evidence<00:00:26.300> that<00:00:26.840> will<00:00:27.290> allow<00:00:27.500> us<00:00:27.529> to

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
the best evidence that will allow us to

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.010 
the best evidence that will allow us to
better<00:00:28.070> manage<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.790> horses<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.390> meet<00:00:29.869> the

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
better manage the horses and meet the

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.440 
better manage the horses and meet the
mission<00:00:30.349> in<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.529> goals<00:00:30.770> of<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.160> program<00:00:31.450> what

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
mission in the goals of the program what

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.030 
mission in the goals of the program what
we<00:00:32.599> started<00:00:32.960> with<00:00:33.020> was<00:00:33.380> where<00:00:33.680> we<00:00:33.829> could<00:00:34.010> find

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
we started with was where we could find

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.799 
we started with was where we could find
common<00:00:34.670> ground<00:00:34.700> among<00:00:35.149> all<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.690> the

common ground among all of the

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.139 
common ground among all of the
stakeholders<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.829> public<00:00:37.160> and<00:00:37.399> that<00:00:37.430> is

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
stakeholders in the public and that is

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.270 
stakeholders in the public and that is
that<00:00:38.390> no<00:00:38.930> one<00:00:39.170> really<00:00:39.200> wants<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.860> see<00:00:40.040> more

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
that no one really wants to see more

horses in long-term holding this is from

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.100 
horses in long-term holding this is from
an<00:00:43.190> economic<00:00:43.700> viewpoint<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.330> costs<00:00:44.570> continue

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
an economic viewpoint the costs continue

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.720 
an economic viewpoint the costs continue
to<00:00:45.140> rise<00:00:45.320> as<00:00:45.770> horses<00:00:46.160> are<00:00:46.280> maintained<00:00:46.700> in

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
to rise as horses are maintained in

to rise as horses are maintained in
long-term<00:00:47.060> holding<00:00:47.840> secondly<00:00:48.770> this<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.100> not

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
long-term holding secondly this is not

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
the vision that is associated with what

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420 
the vision that is associated with what
the<00:00:53.570> public<00:00:53.930> wants<00:00:54.230> to<00:00:54.290> see<00:00:54.380> with<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:55.130> horses

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the public wants to see with with horses

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.600 
the public wants to see with with horses
on<00:00:55.700> on<00:00:55.880> these<00:00:56.420> wild<00:00:57.410> lands<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.070> starting<00:00:58.430> from

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
on on these wild lands so starting from

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.819 
on on these wild lands so starting from
a<00:00:58.700> common<00:00:59.120> ground<00:00:59.420> what<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.260> science<00:01:00.680> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
a common ground what is the science and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.590 
a common ground what is the science and
the<00:01:00.890> best<00:01:01.100> evidence<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.880> would<00:01:02.360> support

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the best evidence that would support

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.840 
the best evidence that would support
improving<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.590> program<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.369> horses<00:01:04.820> are

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
improving the program so that horses are

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.429 
improving the program so that horses are
no<00:01:05.089> longer<00:01:05.329> going<00:01:05.479> into<00:01:06.049> these<00:01:06.140> long-term

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
no longer going into these long-term

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.800 
no longer going into these long-term
facilities<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.329> kind<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.659> as<00:01:08.780> a

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
facilities so with this kind of as a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.499 
facilities so with this kind of as a
background<00:01:09.189> we<00:01:10.189> really<00:01:10.399> looked<00:01:10.640> at<00:01:10.729> both<00:01:10.970> what

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
background we really looked at both what

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.210 
background we really looked at both what
science<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.140> needed<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:12.710> also<00:01:12.890> what<00:01:13.189> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
science is needed but also what the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.370 
science is needed but also what the
opportunities<00:01:13.939> are<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.270> induce<00:01:14.540> change<00:01:14.930> at

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
opportunities are to induce change at

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.590 
opportunities are to induce change at
present<00:01:16.010> so<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.940> science<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:17.420> really

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
present so the science it really

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.630 
present so the science it really
underlies<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.620> better<00:01:18.920> understand

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
underlies this is to better understand

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.990 
underlies this is to better understand
the<00:01:20.000> populations<00:01:20.780> on<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.010> public<00:01:22.340> lands<00:01:22.760> so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the populations on the public lands so

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.730 
the populations on the public lands so
that<00:01:23.150> they<00:01:23.300> can<00:01:23.450> be<00:01:23.479> better<00:01:23.840> managed<00:01:24.380> will

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
that they can be better managed will

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.920 
that they can be better managed will
better<00:01:25.100> understand<00:01:25.670> what<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.000> actual<00:01:26.330> number

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
better understand what the actual number

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.560 
better understand what the actual number
of<00:01:27.140> horses<00:01:27.350> are<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.070> will<00:01:28.250> allow<00:01:28.490> us<00:01:28.520> both<00:01:29.299> to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
of horses are this will allow us both to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.480 
of horses are this will allow us both to
make<00:01:29.750> sure<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.140> we're<00:01:30.320> managing<00:01:30.560> them<00:01:31.070> for

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
make sure that we're managing them for

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.399 
make sure that we're managing them for
genetic<00:01:31.880> health<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.810> animals<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.320> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
genetic health of the animals in the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.430 
genetic health of the animals in the
population<00:01:34.299> secondly<00:01:35.299> allows<00:01:35.630> us<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.990> assess

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
population secondly allows us to assess

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.880 
population secondly allows us to assess
the<00:01:37.100> impact<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.790> any<00:01:37.970> strategies<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:39.500> control

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
the impact of any strategies to control

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.620 
the impact of any strategies to control
their<00:01:40.070> numbers<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:40.940> there<00:01:41.210> are<00:01:41.240> certain

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
their numbers so there are certain

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.560 
their numbers so there are certain
science<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.380> will<00:01:42.530> not<00:01:42.860> only<00:01:43.010> improve<00:01:43.570> our

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
science that will not only improve our

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.359 
science that will not only improve our
understanding<00:01:44.600> our<00:01:45.320> ability<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.830> manage

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
understanding our ability to manage

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.580 
understanding our ability to manage
these<00:01:46.729> horses<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.479> will<00:01:47.780> also<00:01:47.960> make<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.350> more

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
these horses it will also make it more

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.260 
these horses it will also make it more
transparent<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.549> public<00:01:49.760> is<00:01:50.030> more

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
transparent so the public is more

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.230 
transparent so the public is more
engaged<00:01:50.659> in<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:52.250> addition<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:53.150> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
engaged in it so in addition to the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.060 
engaged in it so in addition to the
science<00:01:53.689> that<00:01:53.810> underlies<00:01:54.229> all<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:54.860> there

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
science that underlies all of this there

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.950 
science that underlies all of this there
are<00:01:55.100> current<00:01:55.670> things<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.240> implement<00:01:56.570> now

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
are current things we can implement now

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.620 
are current things we can implement now
to<00:01:57.439> reduce<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.220> growth<00:01:58.790> rate<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.360> horses

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
to reduce the growth rate on the horses

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.880 
to reduce the growth rate on the horses
and<00:01:59.900> we<00:01:59.960> want<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.260> do<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:00.710> two<00:02:00.860> reasons

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
and we want to do this for two reasons

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.060 
and we want to do this for two reasons
the<00:02:01.430> first<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:02.119> if<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.840> horses<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.470> continue

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
the first is if the horses just continue

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.070 
the first is if the horses just continue
to<00:02:04.100> grow<00:02:04.460> regardless<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.479> how<00:02:05.540> much<00:02:05.780> range

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
to grow regardless of how much range

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.440 
to grow regardless of how much range
land<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.530> allocated<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.280> them<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.090> end<00:02:08.239> to

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
land is allocated to them in the end to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.809 
land is allocated to them in the end to
things<00:02:08.659> are<00:02:08.959> assured<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.769> happen<00:02:10.099> that<00:02:10.129> is<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
things are assured to happen that is the

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.940 
things are assured to happen that is the
range<00:02:11.120> land<00:02:11.480> loses<00:02:11.959> its<00:02:12.140> quality<00:02:12.620> it's

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
range land loses its quality it's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.830 
range land loses its quality it's
actually<00:02:13.280> destroyed<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:14.390> use<00:02:14.510> for<00:02:14.540> other

actually destroyed for use for other

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.350 
actually destroyed for use for other
wild<00:02:15.260> animals<00:02:15.409> and<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.670> other<00:02:16.790> problem<00:02:17.239> with

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
wild animals and the other problem with

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.390 
wild animals and the other problem with
that<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.599> eventually<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.349> horses<00:02:18.769> themselves

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that is eventually the horses themselves

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.239 
that is eventually the horses themselves
will<00:02:19.579> become<00:02:19.939> ill<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.239> unthrifty<00:02:21.040> due<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.249 
will become ill and unthrifty due to

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.990 
will become ill and unthrifty due to
inadequate<00:02:22.760> feed<00:02:23.299> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
inadequate access to water so in doing

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.520 
inadequate access to water so in doing
this<00:02:26.850> we<00:02:27.060> want<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.390> reduce<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.050> growth<00:02:28.230> rate

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
this we want to reduce the growth rate

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.140 
this we want to reduce the growth rate
to<00:02:28.710> something<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.280> be<00:02:29.370> managed<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.030> the

to something that can be managed so the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.560 
to something that can be managed so the
horse<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.540> rather<00:02:30.810> than<00:02:31.050> being<00:02:31.260> taken<00:02:31.710> off
