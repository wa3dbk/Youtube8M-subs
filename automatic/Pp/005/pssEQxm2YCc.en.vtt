playing<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.539> things<00:00:18.570> we've<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
playing as with all things we've got to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.510 
playing as with all things we've got to
make<00:00:19.350> sure<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> rudiments<00:00:20.369> down

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
make sure we have the rudiments down

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.840 
make sure we have the rudiments down
before<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.480> progress<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.850> use

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
before we can really progress and use

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.390 
before we can really progress and use
those<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.269> build<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.590> we'll<00:00:25.800> begin<00:00:25.949> first

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
those to build on so we'll begin first

of<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.730> by<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> hold<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.439> pick<00:00:28.590> I've<00:00:28.830> got

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
of all by how to hold the pick I've got

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.810 
of all by how to hold the pick I've got
a<00:00:29.039> blue<00:00:29.490> pick<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.840> contrast<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a blue pick here for contrast what you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
a blue pick here for contrast what you
do<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.750> place<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.550> thumb<00:00:36.200> across<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:38.190> top

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
do is you place the thumb across the top

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
do is you place the thumb across the top
of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> pick<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.149> approximately<00:00:39.870> right

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
of the pick at approximately right

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
of the pick at approximately right
angles<00:00:40.649> I'll<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.280> try<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> bring<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> up

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
angles I'll just try to bring that up

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690 
angles I'll just try to bring that up
closer<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> approximately<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.309> angles<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
closer and approximately right angles to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
closer and approximately right angles to
the<00:00:44.879> tip<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> pick<00:00:45.420> covering<00:00:45.930> about<00:00:46.050> half

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the tip of the pick covering about half

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
the tip of the pick covering about half
of<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> look<00:00:47.640> underneath

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of it now if you have a look underneath

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
of it now if you have a look underneath
now<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> 1st<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> index<00:00:50.550> finger

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
now see how the 1st or the index finger

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
now see how the 1st or the index finger
is<00:00:51.210> almost<00:00:52.140> following<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.379> edge<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
is almost following the the edge of the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.979 
is almost following the the edge of the
pick<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> speak<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.120> basically<00:00:57.629> like

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pick so to speak so it's basically like

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
pick so to speak so it's basically like
thumb<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.629> index<00:01:00.629> finger<00:01:00.750> almost<00:01:01.579> forming

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
thumb and index finger almost forming

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.450 
thumb and index finger almost forming
the<00:01:02.699> cross<00:01:02.940> shape<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.390> crossing<00:01:03.750> each<00:01:03.899> other

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
the cross shape and crossing each other

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.070 
the cross shape and crossing each other
so<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.580> basic<00:01:06.090> pick<00:01:06.240> position<00:01:06.720> holding

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so that's basic pick position holding

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
so that's basic pick position holding
position<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.700> hold<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> pick<00:01:09.360> you've

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
position when you hold the pick you've

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
position when you hold the pick you've
got<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> make<00:01:09.990> sure<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.180> gripped

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
got to make sure that it's not gripped

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
got to make sure that it's not gripped
too<00:01:12.990> firmly<00:01:13.590> otherwise<00:01:14.130> everything<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
too firmly otherwise everything will be

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
too firmly otherwise everything will be
very<00:01:15.180> stiff<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.869> won't<00:01:16.049> footwork<00:01:16.650> for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
very stiff and just won't footwork for

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
very stiff and just won't footwork for
you<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> you've<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.420> sure

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you and you've also got to make sure

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
you and you've also got to make sure
that<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.049> gripped<00:01:19.320> too<00:01:19.439> light<00:01:19.710> because

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that it's not gripped too light because

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.190 
that it's not gripped too light because
otherwise<00:01:20.340> you'll<00:01:20.729> drop<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.080> I've<00:01:22.170> just

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
otherwise you'll drop it so I've just

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.179 
otherwise you'll drop it so I've just
got<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:24.170> ideal<00:01:25.170> grip<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:25.950> hard

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
got to get an ideal grip not too hard

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
got to get an ideal grip not too hard
not<00:01:26.280> too<00:01:26.580> soft<00:01:26.610> you'll<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.210> able<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> work<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
not too soft you'll be able to work that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.510 
not too soft you'll be able to work that
out<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> play<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> synthesis<00:01:29.280> that's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
out as you play in the synthesis that's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690 
out as you play in the synthesis that's
striking<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> strings<00:01:31.549> there<00:01:32.549> are

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
striking the strings there are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
striking the strings there are
essentially<00:01:33.299> two<00:01:33.600> different<00:01:33.630> types<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
essentially two different types of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.030 
essentially two different types of
picking<00:01:35.600> one<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> call<00:01:37.140> flat<00:01:37.740> picking

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
picking one is what I call flat picking

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
picking one is what I call flat picking
and<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> go<00:01:42.079> right

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and that's actually when you go right

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.569 
and that's actually when you go right
angles<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> strings<00:01:44.009> basically

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
angles to the strings basically

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.880 
angles to the strings basically
vertically<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> sound<00:01:46.619> I'm

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
vertically so you get this sound I'm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
vertically so you get this sound I'm
just<00:01:47.070> muting<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.399> strings<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.270> just

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just muting the strings now so just

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
just muting the strings now so just
hearing<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.409> pure<00:01:50.159> favi<00:01:50.729> sound<00:01:51.979> now

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
hearing that that pure favi sound now

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
hearing that that pure favi sound now
that's<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.210> straight<00:01:54.420> across<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that's just going straight across or so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
that's just going straight across or so
if<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.649> show<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> top<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.549> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
if I can show you from the top I know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
if I can show you from the top I know
it's<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.090> difficult<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.380> I'll<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.680> other

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it's a bit difficult but I'll see other

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's a bit difficult but I'll see other
the<00:01:59.399> other<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.880> angling<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> pick<00:02:00.750> how

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the other thing is angling the pick how

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.200 
the other thing is angling the pick how
does<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> sound<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.670> very<00:02:02.880> scratchy

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
does that sound it's very scratchy

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
does that sound it's very scratchy
that's<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.450> too<00:02:06.600> bad<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that's not too bad if you want to get a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
that's not too bad if you want to get a
grungy<00:02:07.979> sound<00:02:08.280> okay<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:08.970> they're<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> two

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
grungy sound okay so they're the two

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630 
grungy sound okay so they're the two
types<00:02:09.959> this

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
types this

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.059 
types this
I<00:02:11.700> call<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> scratch<00:02:12.450> peeking<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> other

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
I call a scratch peeking and the other

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.590 
I call a scratch peeking and the other
one<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.340> flatpicking<00:02:14.850> which<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> much

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
one is flatpicking which is a much

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.070 
one is flatpicking which is a much
cleaner<00:02:15.959> sound<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:18.480> doing<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
cleaner sound so as I'm doing there the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
cleaner sound so as I'm doing there the
first<00:02:19.260> thing<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.770> actually<00:02:20.100> do<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.459> mute

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
first thing you can actually do is mute

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.820 
first thing you can actually do is mute
the<00:02:20.880> strings<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:21.870> fretting<00:02:22.440> hand<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the strings with your fretting hand and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.270 
the strings with your fretting hand and
then<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:24.200> doing<00:02:25.200> downstrokes<00:02:26.100> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
then just start doing downstrokes and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.400 
then just start doing downstrokes and
upstrokes<00:02:26.400> our<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.360> stroke<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.990> when<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> go

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
upstrokes our down stroke is when you go

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.170 
upstrokes our down stroke is when you go
to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.680> floor<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:28.950> upstroke<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to the floor and upstroke is like to the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.020 
to the floor and upstroke is like to the
ceiling<00:02:30.630> or<00:02:30.750> toward<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.230> face<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:32.700> each<00:02:32.880> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
ceiling or toward your face on each of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:50.060 
ceiling or toward your face on each of
the<00:02:33.120> strings<00:02:47.570> see<00:02:48.570> how<00:02:48.690> my<00:02:48.870> fingers<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.530> not

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the strings see how my fingers are not

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.570 
the strings see how my fingers are not
flying<00:02:50.790> out<00:02:51.180> they're<00:02:51.390> actually<00:02:51.840> quite

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
flying out they're actually quite

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580 
flying out they're actually quite
relaxed<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.510> curved<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.410> bit

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
relaxed and just curved in a little bit

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.440 
relaxed and just curved in a little bit
just<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.550> they're<00:02:56.670> sort<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:56.970> gliding

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
just so that they're sort of gliding

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.640 
just so that they're sort of gliding
across<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> top<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.200> strings<00:02:58.470> without

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
across the top of the strings without

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.400 
across the top of the strings without
touching<00:02:59.519> them<00:02:59.820> now<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.600> same<00:03:00.900> picking

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
touching them now the same picking

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.590 
touching them now the same picking
approach<00:03:01.739> goes<00:03:02.040> for<00:03:02.370> only<00:03:02.790> down<00:03:03.000> strokes<00:03:03.390> you

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
approach goes for only down strokes you

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.270 
approach goes for only down strokes you
you<00:03:03.840> generally<00:03:04.290> use<00:03:04.320> down<00:03:04.650> strokes<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:05.190> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
you generally use down strokes if you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040 
you generally use down strokes if you
want<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.550> get<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> slightly<00:03:06.060> more<00:03:06.450> aggressive

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
want to get a slightly more aggressive

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:31.640 
want to get a slightly more aggressive
sound<00:03:07.800> bigger<00:03:08.700> sound<00:03:30.049> okay<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.079> I've<00:03:31.290> got<00:03:31.320> down

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
sound bigger sound okay so I've got down

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.440 
sound bigger sound okay so I've got down
stroke<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.310> stroke<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.150> course<00:03:33.360> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
stroke up stroke and of course a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.990 
stroke up stroke and of course a
combination<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.200> down<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.799> strokes<00:03:35.130> most

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
combination of down and up strokes most

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.640 
combination of down and up strokes most
of<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.209> time<00:03:36.390> when<00:03:36.570> we<00:03:36.690> start<00:03:36.959> picking<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
of the time when we start picking on the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.470 
of the time when we start picking on the
first<00:03:37.950> speed<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.549> phrase<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.000> we're<00:03:39.269> going

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
first speed of a phrase that we're going

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.420 
first speed of a phrase that we're going
to<00:03:39.570> play<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.900> will<00:03:39.989> usually<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> Down<00:03:41.040> stroke

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
to play it will usually be a Down stroke

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.949 
to play it will usually be a Down stroke
but<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.820> really<00:03:42.060> depends<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.570> lot<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
but it really depends a lot on the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.050 
but it really depends a lot on the
phrase<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.100> couple<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.430> things<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.910> do

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
phrase so a couple of things you can do

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.910 
phrase so a couple of things you can do
is<00:03:45.150> besides<00:03:45.570> practicing<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:46.680> across

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
is besides practicing just going across

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.250 
is besides practicing just going across
the<00:03:47.190> strings<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.850> getting<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.329> muted<00:03:49.019> 30

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the strings and getting that muted 30

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.810 
the strings and getting that muted 30
sound<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.160> rhythm<00:03:50.340> correct

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
sound just to get the rhythm correct

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.560 
sound just to get the rhythm correct
first<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.900> you're<00:03:52.019> not<00:03:52.110> sort<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.410> being<00:03:53.570> how

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
first so you're not sort of being how

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.690 
first so you're not sort of being how
can<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.870> say<00:03:55.079> distracted<00:03:55.620> by<00:03:56.040> trying<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.549> play

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
can I say distracted by trying to play

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
can I say distracted by trying to play
notes<00:03:57.030> with<00:03:57.720> your<00:03:57.870> fretting<00:03:58.230> hand<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.620> just<00:03:58.650> do

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
notes with your fretting hand so just do

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.789 
notes with your fretting hand so just do
the<00:03:59.420> muted<00:04:00.420> string<00:04:00.660> exercise<00:04:01.170> first<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.709> then

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
the muted string exercise first and then

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.170 
the muted string exercise first and then
you<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:02.010> start<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.370> vary<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.850> rhythms

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you can start to vary the rhythms

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.030 
you can start to vary the rhythms
something<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:03.989> would<00:04:04.170> go<00:04:04.260> boom<00:04:04.470> boom

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
something like this would go boom boom

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.700 
something like this would go boom boom
boom

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:24.180 

down<00:04:21.450> etc<00:04:22.450> so<00:04:22.930> just<00:04:23.140> make<00:04:23.290> up<00:04:23.470> variations

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
down etc so just make up variations

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.460 
down etc so just make up variations
quarter<00:04:25.150> notes<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.480> triplets<00:04:25.690> for<00:04:26.080> example

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
quarter notes and triplets for example

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.740 
quarter notes and triplets for example
one<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:27.190> triple<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.000> triple<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:28.600> one<00:04:30.750> there

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
one to triple the triple at one there

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.480 
one to triple the triple at one there
are<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.110> many<00:04:32.230> things<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.710> can<00:04:32.860> do<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.250> just

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
are so many things you can do so just

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.760 
are so many things you can do so just
start<00:04:33.760> by<00:04:34.060> doing<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.510> muted<00:04:35.050> string<00:04:35.290> exercise

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
start by doing the muted string exercise

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.500 
start by doing the muted string exercise
first<00:04:36.070> as<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.370> suggest<00:04:36.910> then<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.150> can<00:04:37.270> start

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
first as I suggest then you can start

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.340 
first as I suggest then you can start
adding<00:04:37.690> notes<00:04:39.630> let's<00:04:40.630> just<00:04:40.870> add<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> couple<00:04:41.230> of

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
adding notes let's just add a couple of

00:04:41.350 --> 00:05:02.340 
adding notes let's just add a couple of
notes<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.950> a<00:04:41.980> string<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.460> begin<00:04:42.730> with<00:05:01.350> you

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
notes on the a string to begin with you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.750 
notes on the a string to begin with you
might<00:05:02.560> have<00:05:02.680> noticed<00:05:03.040> there<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.340> get<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.520> bit

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
might have noticed there you get a bit

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.110 
might have noticed there you get a bit
more<00:05:04.030> um<00:05:04.500> buzzy<00:05:05.500> sounds<00:05:05.950> like<00:05:06.130> fret<00:05:06.430> buzz<00:05:06.640> etc

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
more um buzzy sounds like fret buzz etc

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.390 
more um buzzy sounds like fret buzz etc
etc<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:07.720> you've<00:05:07.840> got<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> low<00:05:08.320> action<00:05:08.920> on<00:05:09.250> your

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
etc if you've got a low action on your

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.710 
etc if you've got a low action on your
strings<00:05:09.670> you'll<00:05:09.850> certainly<00:05:10.060> create<00:05:10.510> more

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
strings you'll certainly create more

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.570 
strings you'll certainly create more
fret<00:05:10.960> buzzers<00:05:11.350> on<00:05:11.500> your<00:05:11.650> strings<00:05:12.010> let's<00:05:12.340> try

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
fret buzzers on your strings let's try

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.790 
fret buzzers on your strings let's try
that<00:05:12.790> one<00:05:13.000> now<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:13.480> the<00:05:13.690> scratchy<00:05:14.410> side

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
that one now with the scratchy side

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:26.720 
that one now with the scratchy side
sideways<00:05:15.430> picking

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:37.760 

so<00:05:27.510> just<00:05:27.720> experiment<00:05:28.260> yourself<00:05:36.590> octaves<00:05:37.590> are

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
so just experiment yourself octaves are

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.500 
so just experiment yourself octaves are
very<00:05:37.920> important<00:05:40.580> so<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.640> script<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.150> octave

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
very important so to script the octave

00:05:42.510 --> 00:06:04.200 
very important so to script the octave
play<00:05:43.400> generally<00:05:44.400> downstroke<00:05:45.390> upstroke

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.580 

anything<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:05.300> like<00:06:05.479> just<00:06:05.749> experiment<00:06:06.319> and<00:06:06.469> of

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
anything you like just experiment and of

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.110 
anything you like just experiment and of
course<00:06:06.800> go<00:06:06.949> to<00:06:07.009> the<00:06:07.159> next<00:06:07.400> string<00:06:07.610> group<00:06:07.879> like

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
course go to the next string group like

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:21.580 
course go to the next string group like
the<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.569> the<00:06:08.659> G<00:06:08.840> strings<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:21.080> that<00:06:21.110> will

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
the a and the G strings so that will

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.989 
the a and the G strings so that will
certainly<00:06:22.159> give<00:06:22.340> you<00:06:22.490> enough<00:06:22.759> of<00:06:22.849> an

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:22.999 
certainly give you enough of an

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.519 
certainly give you enough of an
introduction<00:06:23.569> on<00:06:23.659> picking<00:06:24.110> for<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:24.379> to

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
introduction on picking for you to

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.550 
introduction on picking for you to
practice<00:06:24.949> and<00:06:25.189> then<00:06:25.759> start<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.360> apply<00:06:26.689> that<00:06:26.960> to

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
practice and then start to apply that to

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.070 
practice and then start to apply that to
your<00:06:27.590> own<00:06:27.740> style<00:06:28.550> of<00:06:28.729> playing<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.749> enjoy<00:06:30.050> that
