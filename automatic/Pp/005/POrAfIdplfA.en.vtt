00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 my personal claims to the metal detector 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.670
 gorod is no much about it at all such 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.570
 disadvantages but either selects temporarily 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.160
 copy or it is inconvenient for example collet 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 clamp 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 collet gate clamp you pro he hasn't 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 stroke limiter can be twisted 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 until the moment he miss 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 will crack especially here such weather as 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.650
 now around 0 and the hands feel bad and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.980
 plastics fragile and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.970
 and cracking him is very easy 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.420
 I already used to spin it with the average 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.760
 by effort 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.720
 the main thing is that there was no rest 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.720
 and that's enough 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.530
 the second is the wire section 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:01.910
 in fact, it is very difficult to insert 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.180
 maybe it's just for me but my friend 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.270
 who walks in the same mountain there and you about 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.619
 it is exactly the same problem like 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.950
 and there are tags that need to be combined and 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.920
 seemingly 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.220
 well everything has to go really he 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.020
 enters very badly here I am now 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.990
 really trying its statute 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.990
 and this happens every cube 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.660
 combine tags 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.860
 and in the cold it is even harder to do 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.039
 here 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.509
 Now 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.659
 locknut which fixes to 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.939
 the plug does not fall out of the socket 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.430
 also seen in practice every half hour 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.229
 I have to check I do not know how 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.229
 the way she relaxes and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.520
 a fountain appears really phantoms then 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.440
 there is when he starts calling 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.440
 The first thing I do is check. 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.440
 lock nut 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:36.230
 connector still by air by air 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.670
 you about a very good trick he 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.670
 very good pinpoint 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 Well, in practice, direct in practice 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.890
 each 3 fossa is a fossa which 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.670
 rolled lice in reality here 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.320
 pinpoint identified 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.900
 the center of the goal in reality the find lies 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.430
 on the side so every third happens 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 fossa and here the deeper it turns out 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:39.530
 purpose of the fact as he moves more to the side 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.230
 real goal center but again this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.090
 such a feature probably dd coils 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.910
 here it is, that is, not only on the city, but you 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.470
 about another flaw which only 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.390
 that manifested a frenzy is it about you turn on 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.150
 metal detector with power button 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:06.590
 And I have a habit when I 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.480
 digging a hole I very often turn off 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.150
 metal look to save battery and 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.320
 maybe this points gone maybe another 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.209
 some device 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.660
 I just click once I want 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.910
 turn off and every time i 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.890
 one click on the city this pro 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:31.210
 power it just goes next 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:35.200
 simple hold mode it turns off 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.200
 again about the food 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:49.889
 at gareth it's about 4 4 aa batteries, they are 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.349
 such a duck net and takasi is the same 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.699
 most cassette 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:59.009
 food like mountain jedi 2500 not only 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.169
 that it is fragile that is, if it will be 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.479
 battery and miss out there on some 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.960
 hard surface it breaks but 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.240
 very thin and again with such 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.930
 temperature is now 0 degrees 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.779
 it becomes even steeper 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.340
 designations like i owe her 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:23.009
 insert a blog that is, I can her 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.360
 leave so i can rearrange so 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.360
 no no 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.019
 no pointer 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:37.469
 and that's not every time you have to first 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:40.109
 insert it insert yes it was 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:45.289
 right first time got good i 

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:47.789
 insert so i flipped changed pole 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:52.129
 turn on nothing happens 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:56.789
 ok i rearrange it the other way around 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:59.579
 turn on it turned on again I tried 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.359
 turn it off it is not the first time 

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:04.679
 turned off 

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:07.739
 same applies cap which 

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:12.569
 closes the block itself; you can insert it as 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:17.609
 I like it and every time I have her 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:19.759
 I insert first trying to close well here 

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:22.259
 I now put it the first time 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.729
 like little things but each of these 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:28.199
 little nuances are accumulating and 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.429
 starts to take away either time either 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:35.009
 create little inconvenience on the other 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:37.679
 hand I understand that the metal detector 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.589
 no flaws are not better 

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:44.279
 let there be such flaws 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.289
 than the same breaking ears in xtr and 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:50.279
 either inaccurate issue 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.439
 I am pleased with younger phisher models 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.799
 cities about 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:58.909
 even despite its shortcomings read 

00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:58.909
 could they are up to the arena
