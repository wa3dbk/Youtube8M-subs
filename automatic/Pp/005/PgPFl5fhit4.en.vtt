 this brand has been wanting to approve 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.610

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.630
 I never decided so today because of 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.640
 late when there are tribes I have seen a 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.310
 small stand a small stand was not 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.770
 It was a menu and they were three boxes and 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.900
 made of like three goblets and had 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.629
 blushers Lipstick 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.260
 I do not know what else and super eye pencils 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.629
 few thousand- year-old things 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.299
 in case you do not know it on the first south DVD 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.470
 They have put some little things 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.329
 milan and because that can not be 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.560
 consider shelf that if responsible 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.239
 of the first month treatment please 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.310
 put a be in conditions nothing wrong 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.349
 they will change and because I want to see the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.060
 products and I want there to be a tester 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.920
 because on top of that there was no 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.200
 there was what there was contact with a 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.840
 dropper than what there was 122 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.299
 units of each color the super little 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.799
 but well something is something but what I say 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.479
 that nobody has tester and had to be 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.400
 looking for the tones looking for switches by 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.020
 the mobile to decide between ones and 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.970
 others and good that 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.320
 so well let's hope that with everything 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.420
 that I was taking me from Milan is what I 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.680
 they are going to take the whole world because it is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.170
 that's going to fly happy that they give 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.640

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.090

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.069

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.050
