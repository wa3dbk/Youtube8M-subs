00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
would like to look at it just like this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.260

that<00:01:09.420> hook<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.840> lay<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> bait<00:01:10.560> when

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that hook will lay on that bait when

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
that hook will lay on that bait when
it's<00:01:10.920> finished<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> mental

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.889 
imitating this 90 degree Bend and so
then<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.619> feed<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> through<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
then you just feed it through and if you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
then you just feed it through and if you
do<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> right<00:01:49.380> it'll<00:01:49.920> end<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.310> laying<00:01:50.640> about

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
do it right it'll end up laying about

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
do it right it'll end up laying about
like<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.140> when<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> goes<00:01:52.680> inside<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like it will when it goes inside the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.270 
like it will when it goes inside the
body<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.240> hook<00:01:54.450> point<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
body the hook point now will go right in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
body the hook point now will go right in
the<00:01:56.430> slot<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> body<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.170> then<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:58.649> put

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the slot in the body and then I'll put

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
the slot in the body and then I'll put
my<00:01:58.950> finger<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> bait<00:02:00.380> slide

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
my finger on the back of the bait slide

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
my finger on the back of the bait slide
that<00:02:01.590> hook<00:02:01.770> back<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.250> again<00:02:02.549> start<00:02:03.210> pulling

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that hook back and again start pulling

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
that hook back and again start pulling
it<00:02:03.719> through<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.079> soft<00:02:04.710> plastic<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.430> feel

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it through the soft plastic and I feel

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
it through the soft plastic and I feel
it<00:02:05.880> touch<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.360> finger<00:02:06.750> tip<00:02:06.990> right<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
it touch my finger tip right there and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.729 
it touch my finger tip right there and
now<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.580> hook<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.030> laying<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> slot<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
now that hook is laying on a slot this

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.760 
now that hook is laying on a slot this
weedless<00:02:11.450> single<00:02:12.450> hook<00:02:12.629> riding<00:02:13.080> downward

it's<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.820> fish<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> as<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> top<00:02:15.780> water<00:02:15.990> bait

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
it's you can fish it as a top water bait

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's you can fish it as a top water bait
because<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.800> has<00:02:16.950> very<00:02:17.190> little<00:02:17.580> weight<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
because it has very little weight if I

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.900 
because it has very little weight if I
want<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.470> down<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.610> want<00:02:20.820> to
