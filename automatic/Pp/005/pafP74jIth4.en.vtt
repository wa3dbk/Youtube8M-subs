that was the new barricade the barricade
six-point<00:02:26.160> oh<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.750> think<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.590> made<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> lot<00:02:28.950> of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
six-point oh I think that made a lot of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
six-point oh I think that made a lot of
improvements<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:30.060> first<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.870> didn't<00:02:31.830> really

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
improvements at first I didn't really

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.400 
improvements at first I didn't really
like<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> design<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.090> barricade<00:02:33.600> first

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
like the design of the barricade first

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.560 
like the design of the barricade first
time<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.680> saw<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.420> been

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
time I saw it but now it's really been

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.690 
time I saw it but now it's really been
growing<00:02:37.410> on<00:02:37.530> me<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.830> past<00:02:38.040> couple<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.460> days
