00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
well I'm just doing a 1v1 right now but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
well I'm just doing a 1v1 right now but
you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.590> go<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.700> 23<00:00:36.210> B<00:00:36.329> 3

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and 4 view for which is pretty

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.600

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
ridiculous and anyhow in this particular

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.660 
ridiculous and anyhow in this particular
mode<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.010> extra

against<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.690> foes<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.500> well<00:00:49.829> as

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
against your foes as well as

against your foes as well as
specifically<00:00:51.719> indicating<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.530> upgrades

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

you<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.090> turrets<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:55.199> you'll

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you want for your turrets now you'll

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.930 
you want for your turrets now you'll
notice<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> bottom<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
notice the little thing at the bottom so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.319 
notice the little thing at the bottom so
i<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.660> use<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> slider<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.670> actually

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
i can use this slider here to actually

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.280 
i can use this slider here to actually
send<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:02.120> units<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.840> send<00:01:04.229> out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
send out more units or i can send out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.060 
send out more units or i can send out
less<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.129> stronger<00:01:06.030> versions<00:01:06.830> eventually<00:01:07.830> i

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
less but stronger versions eventually i

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.810 
less but stronger versions eventually i
can<00:01:08.460> upgrade<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.380> get<00:01:10.380> flying<00:01:10.950> units<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> come

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
can upgrade and get flying units to come

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
can upgrade and get flying units to come
out<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.380> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> notice<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.130> side

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
out and if you notice on the right side

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.149 
out and if you notice on the right side
under<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.210> tech<00:01:15.540> tree<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> be

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
under my tech tree there are going to be

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
under my tech tree there are going to be
a<00:01:17.250> number<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> options<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.659> either<00:01:19.049> making

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
a number of options for either making

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.020 
a number of options for either making
your<00:01:20.009> units<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:21.119> different<00:01:23.030> activities

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
your units have different activities

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
your units have different activities
that<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.600> perform<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.640> can

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that they can perform or you can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
that they can perform or you can
actually<00:01:27.030> upgrade<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> tech<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.250> certain

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
actually upgrade the tech for certain

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
actually upgrade the tech for certain
turrets<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> balancing<00:01:31.950> act

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
turrets it's kind of a balancing act

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
turrets it's kind of a balancing act
you've<00:01:32.369> gotta<00:01:32.520> decide<00:01:32.939> how<00:01:33.780> strong<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> want

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you've gotta decide how strong you want

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
you've gotta decide how strong you want
to<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> enemy<00:01:34.860> units<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> also

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to make the enemy units but you also

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
to make the enemy units but you also
have<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> defend<00:01:36.360> yourself<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.680> therefore<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have to defend yourself so therefore you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
have to defend yourself so therefore you
need<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:39.270> sure<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.750> yourself

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
need to make sure and get yourself

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.639 
need to make sure and get yourself
strong<00:01:40.619> enough<00:01:40.829> turrets<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.520> survive<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.689> I've

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
strong enough turrets to survive so I've

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
strong enough turrets to survive so I've
been<00:01:43.890> using<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> ones<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:44.880> split

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
been using the ones that actually split

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
been using the ones that actually split
themselves<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.439> when<00:01:46.829> they<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.280> destroyed<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
themselves up when they are destroyed I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.910 
themselves up when they are destroyed I
although<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> notice<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> people<00:01:49.829> are

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
although I notice a lot of people are

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
although I notice a lot of people are
using<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.340> faster<00:01:50.939> units<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> might<00:01:52.380> be

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
using the faster units so that might be

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
using the faster units so that might be
a<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.770> option<00:01:52.979> too<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.670> course<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> game<00:01:54.060> did

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
a good option too of course the game did

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
a good option too of course the game did
just<00:01:54.479> release<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> don't<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.259> how<00:01:55.470> well

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
just release so I don't know how well

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.560 
just release so I don't know how well
balanced<00:01:56.159> everything<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.149> haven't<00:01:57.479> played

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
balanced everything is I haven't played

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
balanced everything is I haven't played
the<00:01:57.719> game<00:01:57.750> long<00:01:58.110> enough<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.710> actually

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the game long enough I'm not actually

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
the game long enough I'm not actually

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that great at it this particular map I'm

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
that great at it this particular map I'm
doing<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.189> better<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.490> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.760 
doing a little bit better on because
it's<00:02:03.719> more<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:06.060> guess<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.930> style<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.530> my

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's more of my I guess my style or my

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.790 
it's more of my I guess my style or my
expertise<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.539> actually<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.200> creating

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
expertise of actually you know creating

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.930 
expertise of actually you know creating
paths<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.730> yourself<00:02:12.090> rather<00:02:12.330> than<00:02:12.450> wearing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
paths for yourself rather than wearing

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.240 
paths for yourself rather than wearing
about<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.270> terrain<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.960> much<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.160> this

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
about the terrain so much so in this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
about the terrain so much so in this
particular<00:02:15.430> mode<00:02:15.970> I've<00:02:16.600> upgraded<00:02:17.080> most<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.800> my

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
particular mode I've upgraded most of my

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.620 
particular mode I've upgraded most of my
turrets<00:02:18.250> I'm<00:02:18.370> trying<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:18.940> tons<00:02:19.300> of

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
turrets I'm trying to get out tons of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.590 
turrets I'm trying to get out tons of
the<00:02:20.020> red<00:02:20.680> ones<00:02:20.950> which<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.280> long<00:02:21.730> range<00:02:22.210> and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
the red ones which have long range and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.410 
the red ones which have long range and
the<00:02:22.720> cost<00:02:23.320> splash<00:02:23.740> damage<00:02:24.010> I've<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> good<00:02:24.940> i

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
the cost splash damage I've got a good i

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.460 
the cost splash damage I've got a good i
guess<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.230> good<00:02:26.910> spread<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.240> slowing<00:02:29.080> turrets

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
guess a good spread of slowing turrets

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.040 
guess a good spread of slowing turrets
as<00:02:29.620> well<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.580> later<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:30.940> down<00:02:31.330> you'll<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
as well so later on down you'll see the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.320 
as well so later on down you'll see the
the<00:02:32.320> tech<00:02:32.620> tree<00:02:32.770> points<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.850> start

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
the tech tree points that you start

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.230 
the tech tree points that you start
earning<00:02:34.540> obviously<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> gets<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.790> costs<00:02:37.000> more

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
earning obviously it gets it costs more

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.630 
earning obviously it gets it costs more
and<00:02:37.300> more<00:02:37.570> down<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> line<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:39.430> match

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
and more down the line in this match

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.780 
and more down the line in this match
here<00:02:39.940> I've<00:02:40.150> upgraded<00:02:40.420> my<00:02:41.260> units<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.220> be<00:02:42.550> much

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
here I've upgraded my units to be much

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.900 
here I've upgraded my units to be much
more<00:02:43.410> armored<00:02:44.410> therefore<00:02:45.400> he's<00:02:45.700> going<00:02:45.850> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
more armored therefore he's going to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.850 
more armored therefore he's going to
have<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> hit<00:02:46.270> him<00:02:46.300> more<00:02:46.600> often<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
have to hit him more often and the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.070 
have to hit him more often and the
slider<00:02:48.160> at<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.460> bottom<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.940> moved<00:02:49.240> up<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.750> little

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
slider at the bottom I moved up a little

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.350 
slider at the bottom I moved up a little
bit<00:02:50.170> more<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> stronger<00:02:51.280> units<00:02:51.670> rather<00:02:52.150> than

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
bit more to stronger units rather than

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.910 
bit more to stronger units rather than
more<00:02:52.720> units<00:02:53.250> therefore<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.820> try<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.920> cause

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
more units therefore I can try to cause

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.830 
more units therefore I can try to cause
him<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.580> not<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:58.000> enough<00:02:58.240> firepower<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
him to not have enough firepower to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.710 
him to not have enough firepower to
destroy<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.470> units<00:02:59.740> I'm<00:02:59.860> sitting<00:03:00.190> out<00:03:00.280> I

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
destroy the units I'm sitting out I

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.570 
destroy the units I'm sitting out I
haven't<00:03:01.720> sent<00:03:02.020> out<00:03:02.140> flying<00:03:03.010> units<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.460> this

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
haven't sent out flying units on this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.150 
haven't sent out flying units on this
one<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.850> feel<00:03:04.270> like<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.570> flying<00:03:04.870> units<00:03:05.230> don't

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
one I feel like the flying units don't

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.460 
one I feel like the flying units don't
really<00:03:06.460> have<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.840> difficult<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.050> path<00:03:08.290> on

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
really have that difficult of a path on

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.920 
really have that difficult of a path on
this<00:03:08.650> particular<00:03:08.830> map<00:03:09.280> now<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.420> going<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> be

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
this particular map now it's going to be

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.560 
this particular map now it's going to be
important<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.530> pretty<00:03:11.740> soon<00:03:12.060> especially<00:03:13.060> at

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
important here pretty soon especially at

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.020 
important here pretty soon especially at
wave<00:03:13.780> 12<00:03:14.140> here<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.440> amount<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:15.310> i<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.700> and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
wave 12 here that amount that i go and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.630 
wave 12 here that amount that i go and
upgrade<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.590> tier<00:03:17.800> 3<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.340> some<00:03:18.520> of<00:03:18.610> my

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
upgrade to the tier 3 on some of my

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.030 
upgrade to the tier 3 on some of my
turrets<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.150> i<00:03:19.180> believe<00:03:19.510> i<00:03:19.540> do<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:20.110> with<00:03:20.800> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
turrets so i believe i do that with the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.550 
turrets so i believe i do that with the
purple<00:03:21.550> turrets<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.180> probably<00:03:23.080> should<00:03:23.530> have

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
purple turrets I probably should have

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.449 
purple turrets I probably should have
done<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.830> on<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.950> red<00:03:24.070> because<00:03:24.220> i<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.430> so

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
done it on the red because i have so

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.810 
done it on the red because i have so
many<00:03:24.670> red<00:03:24.970> turds<00:03:25.239> but<00:03:26.140> i<00:03:26.550> kind<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:27.580> want<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
many red turds but i kind of want to

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.400 
many red turds but i kind of want to
just<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.420> what<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:28.959> purple<00:03:29.290> one

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
just see what the what the purple one

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.780 
just see what the what the purple one
does<00:03:29.560> i'm<00:03:29.830> still<00:03:30.070> really<00:03:30.220> new<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.610> game

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
does i'm still really new to the game

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.320 
does i'm still really new to the game
and<00:03:31.120> i<00:03:31.420> haven't<00:03:31.989> learned<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.760> best<00:03:33.760> uses<00:03:34.300> of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
and i haven't learned the best uses of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.140 
and i haven't learned the best uses of
each<00:03:35.110> individual<00:03:35.709> turret<00:03:36.130> all<00:03:36.610> i<00:03:36.670> know<00:03:36.970> is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
each individual turret all i know is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.210 
each individual turret all i know is
that<00:03:37.360> i<00:03:37.540> need<00:03:37.720> some<00:03:37.870> AOE<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.560> i<00:03:38.620> need<00:03:38.860> some

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that i need some AOE and i need some

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.830 
that i need some AOE and i need some
slowing<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:39.940> that's<00:03:40.150> pretty<00:03:40.360> much<00:03:40.480> what<00:03:40.750> i've

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
slowing and that's pretty much what i've

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.570 
slowing and that's pretty much what i've
got<00:03:41.020> down<00:03:41.260> there<00:03:41.500> are<00:03:41.890> some<00:03:42.100> other<00:03:42.220> turrets

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
got down there are some other turrets

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.940 
got down there are some other turrets
that<00:03:42.790> detects<00:03:43.150> stealth<00:03:43.630> as<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.410> can<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.709> on

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
that detects stealth as you can see on

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.220 
that detects stealth as you can see on
there<00:03:45.250> there's<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.730> little<00:03:45.940> eyeball<00:03:46.420> icon<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
there there's a little eyeball icon so I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.470 
there there's a little eyeball icon so I
could<00:03:47.560> send<00:03:47.920> out<00:03:48.070> stealth<00:03:48.519> units<00:03:48.940> if<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.239> wanted

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
could send out stealth units if I wanted

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.600 
could send out stealth units if I wanted
to<00:03:49.540> notice<00:03:50.440> around<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.830> point<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.580> looks

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
to notice around this point it looks

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.930 
to notice around this point it looks
like<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.060> lot<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.709> enemies<00:03:54.489> are<00:03:54.519> getting

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
like a lot of the enemies are getting

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.270 
like a lot of the enemies are getting
through<00:03:55.269> he's<00:03:55.780> got<00:03:56.019> 18<00:03:56.290> health<00:03:56.800> points<00:03:57.100> left

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
through he's got 18 health points left

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.340 
through he's got 18 health points left
I've<00:03:57.580> actually<00:03:58.209> let<00:03:58.780> four<00:03:58.810> league<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.100> far<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
I've actually let four league so far and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.690 
I've actually let four league so far and
so<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.620> feel<00:04:02.950> like<00:04:02.980> I'm<00:04:03.190> doing<00:04:03.430> pretty<00:04:03.519> well

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
so I feel like I'm doing pretty well

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.720 
so I feel like I'm doing pretty well
I've<00:04:04.480> got<00:04:04.780> just<00:04:05.440> about<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:06.100> good<00:04:06.430> as<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.640> can

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
I've got just about as good as you can

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.850 
I've got just about as good as you can
do<00:04:06.850> but<00:04:07.000> you'll<00:04:07.180> notice<00:04:07.420> also<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:08.320> top<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.709> that

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
do but you'll notice also on top of that

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.880 
do but you'll notice also on top of that
I've<00:04:09.100> got<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:10.000> lot<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> money<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.320> i<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.590> not

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
I've got a lot of money that i have not

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.670 
I've got a lot of money that i have not
spent<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.700> game<00:04:13.120> does<00:04:13.600> not<00:04:13.840> slow<00:04:14.170> down<00:04:14.200> at

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
spent this game does not slow down at

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.250 
spent this game does not slow down at
any<00:04:15.190> point<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:15.940> i<00:04:15.970> think<00:04:16.359> part<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
any point so i think part of the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.210 
any point so i think part of the
difficulty<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.900> doing<00:04:20.410> well<00:04:20.830> and

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
difficulty and you know doing well and

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.409 
difficulty and you know doing well and
this<00:04:22.150> particular<00:04:22.360> game<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.350> getting<00:04:24.070> really

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
this particular game is getting really

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.530 
this particular game is getting really
efficient<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.539> placing<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:25.960> tourist<00:04:26.260> town

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
efficient and placing your tourist town

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.960 
efficient and placing your tourist town
knowing<00:04:26.780> where<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.050> put<00:04:27.320> them<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.970> upgrading

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
knowing where to put them and upgrading

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.010 
knowing where to put them and upgrading
them<00:04:29.150> very<00:04:29.660> quickly<00:04:30.020> but<00:04:31.180> that's<00:04:32.180> kind<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
them very quickly but that's kind of the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320 
them very quickly but that's kind of the
the<00:04:33.650> notion<00:04:34.460> that<00:04:34.490> I'm<00:04:34.670> getting<00:04:34.850> from<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.150> and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the notion that I'm getting from it and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.650 
the notion that I'm getting from it and
that<00:04:35.450> and<00:04:35.630> that's<00:04:35.750> that's<00:04:36.200> more<00:04:37.040> so<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:38.390> they

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
that and that's that's more so that they

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.990 
that and that's that's more so that they
wanted<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> not<00:04:39.500> only<00:04:39.710> make<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.070> difficult<00:04:40.460> to

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
wanted to not only make it difficult to

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 
wanted to not only make it difficult to
strategize<00:04:41.600> which<00:04:41.870> turrets<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.380> put<00:04:42.560> down<00:04:42.710> and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
strategize which turrets to put down and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.790 
strategize which turrets to put down and
where<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.490> put<00:04:43.640> them<00:04:43.760> down<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:45.530> that

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
where to put them down but to have that

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.680 
where to put them down but to have that
high<00:04:46.520> APM<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.200> may<00:04:48.710> hear<00:04:48.920> about<00:04:49.160> from

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
high APM that you may hear about from

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.600 
high APM that you may hear about from
playing<00:04:50.690> different<00:04:51.020> RTS<00:04:52.010> games<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.520> things

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
playing different RTS games and things

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.030 
playing different RTS games and things
like<00:04:52.820> that<00:04:52.880> I<00:04:53.300> didn't<00:04:54.170> do<00:04:54.290> so<00:04:54.620> well<00:04:54.650> in<00:04:54.950> this

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
like that I didn't do so well in this

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.970 
like that I didn't do so well in this
particular<00:04:55.220> map<00:04:55.670> I<00:04:55.910> have<00:04:56.780> no<00:04:57.110> idea<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.710> best

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
particular map I have no idea the best

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.800 
particular map I have no idea the best
strategy<00:04:58.730> for<00:04:58.760> laying<00:04:59.030> down<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.300> turrets<00:04:59.660> as

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
strategy for laying down the turrets as

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.180 
strategy for laying down the turrets as
you<00:05:00.290> can<00:05:00.410> see<00:05:00.500> there<00:05:00.650> are<00:05:00.680> five<00:05:01.160> different

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
you can see there are five different

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.810 
you can see there are five different
paths<00:05:01.940> for<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.750> ground<00:05:02.990> units<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.700> when<00:05:04.700> you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
paths for the ground units and when you

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.300 
paths for the ground units and when you
open<00:05:05.480> up<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.810> air<00:05:06.110> units<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.860> gets<00:05:07.040> even

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
open up the air units it gets even

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.460 
open up the air units it gets even
crazier<00:05:07.790> so<00:05:08.390> this<00:05:08.870> is<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.140> little<00:05:09.320> bit

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
crazier so this is a little bit

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.640 
crazier so this is a little bit
ridiculous<00:05:09.940> he<00:05:11.020> he<00:05:12.020> doesn't<00:05:12.320> let<00:05:12.440> anything

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
ridiculous he he doesn't let anything

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.910 
ridiculous he he doesn't let anything
leaked<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:13.130> think<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.400> think<00:05:13.760> I<00:05:13.850> lose<00:05:14.090> all<00:05:14.390> of<00:05:14.450> my

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
leaked I think I think I lose all of my

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.680 
leaked I think I think I lose all of my
my<00:05:15.920> points<00:05:16.400> before<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.760> even<00:05:16.940> get<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.210> chance<00:05:17.270> to

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
my points before I even get a chance to

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.990 
my points before I even get a chance to
really<00:05:18.530> get<00:05:18.740> started<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.250> don't<00:05:19.430> even<00:05:19.610> upgrade

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
really get started I don't even upgrade

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240 
really get started I don't even upgrade
to<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.300> tier<00:05:20.570> 2<00:05:20.780> turret<00:05:21.200> or<00:05:21.380> anything<00:05:22.070> like<00:05:22.100> that

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
to a tier 2 turret or anything like that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.320 
to a tier 2 turret or anything like that
so<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:24.260> not<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:24.950> not<00:05:25.220> so<00:05:25.400> good<00:05:25.730> on<00:05:25.850> my<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.150> as

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
so not not so not so good on my and as

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.820 
so not not so not so good on my and as
you<00:05:26.420> can<00:05:26.570> see<00:05:26.600> there's<00:05:26.840> all<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.380> other<00:05:27.560> paths

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
you can see there's all the other paths

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.430 
you can see there's all the other paths
are<00:05:28.040> not<00:05:28.220> really<00:05:28.580> converged<00:05:28.970> too<00:05:29.420> well<00:05:29.660> so<00:05:30.140> I

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
are not really converged too well so I

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.830 
are not really converged too well so I
think<00:05:31.100> I<00:05:31.400> think<00:05:31.610> one<00:05:31.940> of<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.150> big<00:05:32.390> things<00:05:32.420> is

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
think I think one of the big things is

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.360 
think I think one of the big things is
if<00:05:33.680> you're<00:05:33.890> going<00:05:33.980> to<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.130> doing<00:05:34.220> the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
if you're going to be doing the

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.530 
if you're going to be doing the
competitive<00:05:34.760> mode<00:05:34.850> since<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.240> randomly

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
competitive mode since it randomly

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.570 
competitive mode since it randomly
chooses<00:05:35.960> a<00:05:35.990> map<00:05:36.290> it<00:05:36.860> could<00:05:37.040> be<00:05:37.130> an<00:05:37.220> easy<00:05:37.370> map

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
chooses a map it could be an easy map

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.760 
chooses a map it could be an easy map
could<00:05:37.760> be<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.910> difficult<00:05:38.420> map<00:05:38.570> is<00:05:38.750> that<00:05:39.470> you're

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
could be a difficult map is that you're

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.550 
could be a difficult map is that you're
going<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.920> want<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.930> probably<00:05:41.930> have<00:05:42.260> at<00:05:42.440> least

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
going to want to probably have at least

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.610 
going to want to probably have at least
a<00:05:42.860> elementary<00:05:43.850> understanding<00:05:43.910> of<00:05:44.660> all<00:05:45.170> of<00:05:45.500> the
