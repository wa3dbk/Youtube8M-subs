matte black it's really modern I love it
to<00:01:31.140> bits<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.619> looks<00:01:31.890> great<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:33.119> they<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to bits it looks great what they do is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
to bits it looks great what they do is
this<00:01:33.720> special<00:01:34.079> technique<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.280> t-fal<00:01:35.640> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this special technique that t-fal have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.510 
this special technique that t-fal have
mastered<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.960> creates<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> harder<00:01:37.920> exterior

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
mastered which creates a harder exterior

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
mastered which creates a harder exterior
it<00:01:38.820> gives<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:39.600> thermal

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
it gives it really good thermal

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
it gives it really good thermal
conductivity<00:01:40.439> which<00:01:41.100> means<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> nice

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
conductivity which means it's a nice

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
conductivity which means it's a nice
thick<00:01:42.600> even<00:01:42.990> pan<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.070> won't<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.520> hot<00:01:44.729> spots

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
