the phone yes this should be two
gigabytes<00:01:53.460> yeah<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.150> we<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.560> let's<00:01:56.130> see

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
gigabytes yeah there we go and let's see

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.270 
gigabytes yeah there we go and let's see
the<00:01:56.550> verizon<00:01:57.000> version<00:01:57.120> information<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.960> what

the verizon version information and what

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.620 
the verizon version information and what
4.3<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.640> general<00:02:00.150> what's<00:02:00.330> quite<00:02:00.600> interesting

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
4.3 in general what's quite interesting

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.460 
4.3 in general what's quite interesting
is<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.400> very<00:02:02.670> light<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.330> 5.5<00:02:04.140> inch

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
is it is it is very light for 5.5 inch

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.740 
is it is it is very light for 5.5 inch
it's<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.580> be<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:06.270> competitive

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
it's also going to be very competitive

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's also going to be very competitive
in<00:02:07.260> terms<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.190> pricing<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
in terms of the pricing because this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
in terms of the pricing because this
will<00:02:09.570> be<00:02:10.130> 549<00:02:11.130> US<00:02:12.060> dollars<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.170> should<00:02:13.410> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
will be 549 US dollars so this should be
