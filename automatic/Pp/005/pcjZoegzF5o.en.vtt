00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
though GT for for pop brake conversion

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.499 
though GT for for pop brake conversion
kit<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> other<00:01:28.770> day<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.240> things

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
kit got the other day and these things

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.230 
kit got the other day and these things
are<00:01:30.750> enormous<00:01:31.680> compared<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> stock<00:01:33.090> ones

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
are enormous compared to stock ones

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
are enormous compared to stock ones
so<00:01:36.240> once<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.170> working<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.000> will

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
so once I've got all this working I will

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.499 
so once I've got all this working I will
be<00:01:39.590> 15<00:01:40.590> rows<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.670> potentially<00:01:42.150> buy<00:01:42.270> new

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be 15 rows and potentially buy new

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.450 
be 15 rows and potentially buy new
wheels<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.350> cross<00:01:43.619> cut<00:01:43.890> pigeon<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.310> get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
wheels or cross cut pigeon when we get

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.710 
wheels or cross cut pigeon when we get
to<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:46.040> yeah<00:01:47.040> moving<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.790> though<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> say

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to it yeah moving on though like I say

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.010 
to it yeah moving on though like I say
tops<00:01:49.259> built<00:01:50.270> when<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.329> come<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> call<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
tops built when I come in to call the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.240 
tops built when I come in to call the
pipework<00:01:52.460> I'm<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.820> waiting<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.860> reduce<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pipework I'm just waiting on a reduce a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.639 
pipework I'm just waiting on a reduce a
bend<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.140> some<00:01:58.140> clips<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:59.399> clumps<00:01:59.670> sorry

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
bend and some clips some clumps sorry

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
bend and some clips some clumps sorry
then<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.860> start<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.490> off<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.759> some

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
then we can start it off I think some

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.240 
then we can start it off I think some
oil<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.860> wouldn't<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
oil in it that probably wouldn't be a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.609 
oil in it that probably wouldn't be a
good<00:02:05.340> idea<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.719> let<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:07.320> give<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
good idea to let it I'll give you a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.300 
good idea to let it I'll give you a
quick<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.220> Denise<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.819> well

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.180 

so<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.910> see<00:02:14.530> that's<00:02:15.530> where<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.920> kind

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
so as you can see that's where it kind

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.880 
so as you can see that's where it kind
of<00:02:16.310> ends<00:02:16.489> have<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.660> quite<00:02:17.930> small<00:02:18.410> Andrea

particular<00:02:27.200> coming<00:02:27.800> between<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.700> big<00:02:28.970> piece

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
particular coming between this big piece

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.990 
particular coming between this big piece
and<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:30.530> driveshaft<00:02:33.670> obviously<00:02:34.670> this<00:02:34.819> will

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
and the driveshaft obviously this will

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.070 
and the driveshaft obviously this will
come<00:02:35.269> down<00:02:35.560> across<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.660> over<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.690> that

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
come down across here and over to that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.759 
come down across here and over to that
weight<00:02:39.739> goes<00:02:40.010> through<00:02:40.280> for<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.489> intercooler

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.530 

so<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:45.920> basically<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.519> piece<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:47.420> I've

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
so it's basically just a piece and I've

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.770 
so it's basically just a piece and I've
got<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.750> piece<00:02:47.930> ready<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.950> needs<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.160> put<00:02:49.250> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
got the piece ready just needs to put a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.710 
got the piece ready just needs to put a
reducer<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.140> it's<00:02:51.230> actually<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:52.540> enlarger<00:02:53.540> but

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
reducer but it's actually a enlarger but

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
reducer but it's actually a enlarger but
the<00:02:53.900> cob<00:02:54.110> reduces<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:54.950> will<00:02:55.069> go<00:02:55.250> from

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the cob reduces so that will go from

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.449 
the cob reduces so that will go from
2-inch<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.690> two<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.349> half<00:02:57.620> inch<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
2-inch there to two and a half inch the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.580 
2-inch there to two and a half inch the
rest<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.849> system

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
rest of the system

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.050 
rest of the system
like<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.620> said<00:03:00.860> water<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.280> run<00:03:01.430> two<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.730> half<00:03:01.819> on

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
like I said water to run two and half on

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.440 
like I said water to run two and half on
the<00:03:02.150> way<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:03.250> unfortunately<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:05.209> just

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the way but unfortunately that's just

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.710 
the way but unfortunately that's just
not<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.720> way<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:08.269> can<00:03:08.450> see<00:03:08.599> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
not the way this is it you can see the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:19.979 
not the way this is it you can see the
turbo<00:03:09.370> down<00:03:10.370> pipe<00:03:10.700> everything<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.750> there<00:03:14.230> not
