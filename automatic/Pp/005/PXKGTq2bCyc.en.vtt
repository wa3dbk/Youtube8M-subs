this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.890> part<00:00:02.159> six<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.820> basic<00:00:03.449> Python

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
this is part six of the basic Python

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.990 
this is part six of the basic Python
programming<00:00:04.470> tutorial<00:00:05.130> for<00:00:05.400> intermediate

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
programming tutorial for intermediate

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.089 
programming tutorial for intermediate
and<00:00:06.210> beginning<00:00:06.629> blender<00:00:07.109> users<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:07.830> using

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
and beginning blender users I'm using

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.049 
and beginning blender users I'm using
version<00:00:08.280> 2.6<00:00:09.120> 3a<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.490> from<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.670> previous

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
version 2.6 3a and from the previous

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.150 
version 2.6 3a and from the previous
lesson<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> basic<00:00:13.410> particle<00:00:13.889> system

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
lesson I have a basic particle system

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.890 
lesson I have a basic particle system
but<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> case<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.330> I'm

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
but in this case you can see I'm

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
but in this case you can see I'm
actually<00:00:16.170> there's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> few<00:00:16.830> things<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.100> on

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
actually there's a few things going on

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.450 
actually there's a few things going on
one<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:18.029> up<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.810> actually<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
one is way up here I actually have a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
one is way up here I actually have a
little<00:00:20.460> physics<00:00:20.850> effect<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> magnet<00:00:21.960> that's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
little physics effect or a magnet that's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
little physics effect or a magnet that's
actually<00:00:22.920> pulling<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> particles<00:00:23.850> towards

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
actually pulling the particles towards

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.929 
actually pulling the particles towards
it<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> I've<00:00:25.019> also<00:00:25.170> changed<00:00:25.820> some<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it and I've also changed some of the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.009 
it and I've also changed some of the
important<00:00:27.330> characteristics<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
important characteristics of the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870 
important characteristics of the
particle<00:00:28.380> system<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.250> time<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
particle system like the start time and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.350 
particle system like the start time and
frame<00:00:31.099> how<00:00:32.099> many<00:00:32.250> particles<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
frame how many particles things of that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.760 
frame how many particles things of that
nature<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:34.469> adding<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
nature because just by adding the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.560 
nature because just by adding the
particle<00:00:35.399> system<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.790> default<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.420> did

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
particle system by default like we did

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
particle system by default like we did
before<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.290> won't<00:00:37.469> give<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.280> we'll

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
before it won't give you that so we'll

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.940 
before it won't give you that so we'll
do<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> lesson<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.770> won't<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.860> an

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
do that in this lesson and won't be an

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
do that in this lesson and won't be an
extensive<00:00:41.370> lesson<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.850> case<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.510> right

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
extensive lesson in this case all right

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
extensive lesson in this case all right
so<00:00:42.960> let's<00:00:43.290> take<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> look<00:00:43.700> I'll<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.940> stop<00:00:45.210> this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so let's take a look I'll just stop this

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
so let's take a look I'll just stop this
right<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:46.010> let's<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.309> we'll<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
right here let's see we'll go back to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
right here let's see we'll go back to
the<00:00:48.059> scripting<00:00:48.420> window<00:00:49.610> like<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.379> one<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the scripting window like this one of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.860 
the scripting window like this one of
the<00:00:52.530> things<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.920> had<00:00:53.010> done<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.940> did<00:00:54.390> add<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the things I had done was I did add the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.250 
the things I had done was I did add the
I<00:00:55.640> did<00:00:56.640> add<00:00:56.820> Global's<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> rest<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
I did add Global's to the rest of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.880 
I did add Global's to the rest of the
colors<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:01.620> added

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
colors up here like this and I've added

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
colors up here like this and I've added
let's<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.789> else<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.090> did<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.719> some

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
let's see what else I did just some

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.289 
let's see what else I did just some
simple<00:01:04.229> things<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.830> basic<00:01:05.339> things<00:01:06.439> oh

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
simple things just some basic things oh

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
simple things just some basic things oh
yeah<00:01:09.299> here's<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.689> particle<00:01:10.170> system<00:01:10.320> stuff

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
yeah here's the particle system stuff

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
yeah here's the particle system stuff
you<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.369> about<00:01:11.490> oh<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> an

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you need to know about oh this is an

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.190 
you need to know about oh this is an
important<00:01:12.720> point<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.740> notice<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
important point now notice here that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
important point now notice here that
this<00:01:16.250> bpy<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.640> opposite<00:01:17.970> object<00:01:18.330> particle

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this bpy that opposite object particle

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.510 
this bpy that opposite object particle
system<00:01:19.140> ad<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.500> saw<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
system ad we saw that in here when you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
system ad we saw that in here when you
did<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.750> looked<00:01:21.960> under<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
did this when we looked under here and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
did this when we looked under here and
we<00:01:22.979> look<00:01:23.159> for<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> directory<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
we look for the directory for that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
we look for the directory for that
information<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.470> saw<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.100> never<00:01:26.520> go

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
information you saw it in there never go

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
information you saw it in there never go
back<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> default<00:01:27.509> window<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
back into the default window and if I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
back into the default window and if I
was<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> add<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> particle<00:01:29.909> system<00:01:30.060> let<00:01:30.689> me<00:01:30.780> just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
was to add a particle system let me just

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
was to add a particle system let me just
put<00:01:31.470> something<00:01:31.740> let<00:01:32.100> me<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.520> something

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
put something let me just put something

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100 
put something let me just put something
in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.000> scene<00:01:33.240> real<00:01:33.450> quick<00:01:33.630> let<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.020> out

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
in the scene real quick let me just out

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
in the scene real quick let me just out
of<00:01:34.229> Q<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.799> plane<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> scene<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:36.000> here

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
of Q or a plane to the scene right here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.910 
of Q or a plane to the scene right here
and<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.869> always<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> add<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> particle

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and I'm always going to add a particle

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
and I'm always going to add a particle
system<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.000> notice<00:01:39.570> if<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
system to it like this notice if I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.740 
system to it like this notice if I
highlight<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.490> mouse<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.600> actually

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
highlight my mouse over that it actually

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.850 
highlight my mouse over that it actually
says<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:44.310> particle<00:01:45.060> system<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.409> bpy

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
says that a particle system is this bpy

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.100 
says that a particle system is this bpy
that<00:01:47.130> opps<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> object<00:01:48.060> particle<00:01:48.720> system<00:01:48.960> at

that opps that object particle system at

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.319 
that opps that object particle system at
so<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.149> however

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
so I know what it is right but however

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
so I know what it is right but however
if<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.689> wanted<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> say<00:01:52.259> change<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> number<00:01:53.220> of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
if I wanted to say change the number of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
if I wanted to say change the number of
particles<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.899> start<00:01:55.170> time<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> end

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
particles the start time and the end

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
particles the start time and the end
time<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> lifetime<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> particles

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
time and the lifetime of the particles

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.850 
time and the lifetime of the particles
which<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> code<00:01:59.610> notice<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.420> says

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
which I do do in the code notice it says

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.190 
which I do do in the code notice it says
particle<00:02:01.860> settings<00:02:02.189> dot<00:02:02.490> lifetime<00:02:03.079> it's<00:02:04.079> like

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
particle settings dot lifetime it's like

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.520 
particle settings dot lifetime it's like
well<00:02:04.469> okay<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.540> noticed<00:02:06.960> from<00:02:09.530> back

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
well okay but if you noticed from back

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.530 
well okay but if you noticed from back
in<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:11.099> when<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.340> had<00:02:11.610> looked<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.150> code

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in here when we had looked at the code

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.400 
in here when we had looked at the code
we<00:02:12.870> looked<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.010> let's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
we looked in here let's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.280 
we looked in here let's
the<00:02:14.500> C<00:02:15.430> juror<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:17.050> VP<00:02:17.890> y<00:02:18.250> dot<00:02:18.900> ops<00:02:20.250> not<00:02:21.250> object

the C juror but VP y dot ops not object

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
the C juror but VP y dot ops not object
like<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.590> well<00:02:24.490> there<00:02:24.730> was<00:02:25.530> particle<00:02:26.530> system

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
like this well there was particle system

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.760 
like this well there was particle system

removed but I didn't see anything about
you<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.230> life<00:02:32.440> time<00:02:32.650> things<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.190> that

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you know life time things like that

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.560 
you know life time things like that
particle<00:02:33.760> setting<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.060> something<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:34.420> that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
particle setting is something like that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690 
particle setting is something like that
and<00:02:34.780> here's<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.590> critical<00:02:36.250> things<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.580> need

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and here's the critical things you need

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.070 
and here's the critical things you need
to<00:02:36.790> know<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.210> starting<00:02:37.840> here's<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.830> if<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
to know for starting here's your if you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.660 
to know for starting here's your if you
well<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.650> here's<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.190> let's<00:02:42.550> go<00:02:42.640> back

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
well you know here's the let's go back

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.000 
well you know here's the let's go back
to<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> default<00:02:43.510> window<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.380> new<00:02:44.560> users

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
to the default window for new users

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.580 
to the default window for new users
here's<00:02:45.910> your<00:02:46.090> start<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.140> would<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:47.470> your

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
here's your start this would be your

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.350 
here's your start this would be your
start<00:02:47.830> frame<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.820> your<00:02:48.940> end<00:02:49.090> frame

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
start frame and that's your end frame

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.940 
start frame and that's your end frame
this<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:49.930> lifetime<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.320> your<00:02:50.470> particles

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
this is your lifetime of your particles

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490 
this is your lifetime of your particles
and<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.280> would<00:02:51.430> be<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> default<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.270> here<00:02:53.200> if

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
and that would be the default in here if

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130 
and that would be the default in here if
you<00:02:53.800> set<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> then<00:02:55.210> let's<00:02:55.780> get<00:02:55.930> rid<00:02:56.080> of

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
you set it and then let's get rid of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.760 
you set it and then let's get rid of
this<00:02:57.570> particle<00:02:58.570> let's<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.530> rid<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.680> this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
this particle let's get rid of this

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.530 
this particle let's get rid of this
object<00:02:59.980> here<00:03:00.400> now<00:03:00.850> let's<00:03:01.000> take<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> look<00:03:01.360> at<00:03:01.450> one

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
object here now let's take a look at one

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.650 
object here now let's take a look at one
of<00:03:01.600> these<00:03:01.720> down<00:03:02.020> here<00:03:02.050> now<00:03:02.770> notice<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.370> is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
of these down here now notice this is

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.050 
of these down here now notice this is
called<00:03:04.660> fountain<00:03:04.990> dot<00:03:05.310> 127<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.850> has<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
called fountain dot 127 it has a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.880 
called fountain dot 127 it has a
thousand<00:03:07.540> particles<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.110> said<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.590> didn't

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
thousand particles I said that I didn't

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.710 
thousand particles I said that I didn't
set<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.070> that's<00:03:09.400> default<00:03:09.790> but<00:03:10.240> see<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> star

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
set that that's default but see the star

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.380 
set that that's default but see the star
frame<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.050> different<00:03:11.440> it's<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> 25<00:03:12.430> ends<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:12.880> 100

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
frame is different it's a 25 ends at 100

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.380 
frame is different it's a 25 ends at 100
it<00:03:14.140> has<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.350> lifetime<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.980> 150<00:03:15.670> particles<00:03:16.120> all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
it has a lifetime of 150 particles all

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.000 
it has a lifetime of 150 particles all
right<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.290> if<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.440> look<00:03:17.560> back<00:03:17.770> in<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
right and so if you look back in the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.810 
right and so if you look back in the
code<00:03:19.740> that's<00:03:20.740> exactly<00:03:21.190> what<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.340> said<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.610> said

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
code that's exactly what I said I said

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.480 
code that's exactly what I said I said
the<00:03:22.660> start<00:03:23.020> frame<00:03:23.260> frame<00:03:23.560> underscores<00:03:24.160> start

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
the start frame frame underscores start

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.990 
the start frame frame underscores start
25<00:03:25.090> frame<00:03:25.780> underscore<00:03:26.230> end<00:03:26.410> 100<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.370> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
25 frame underscore end 100 and the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.360 
25 frame underscore end 100 and the
lifetime<00:03:28.180> 150<00:03:29.080> hears<00:03:29.590> optionally<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.340> can

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
lifetime 150 hears optionally you can

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.940 
lifetime 150 hears optionally you can
set<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.900> want<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.110> have<00:03:32.230> hair<00:03:32.440> particles

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
set if you want to have hair particles

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.949 
set if you want to have hair particles
versus<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.520> admit<00:03:33.790> err<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.330> use<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.750> as

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
versus the admit err you can use that as

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.600 
versus the admit err you can use that as
well<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.170> tried<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.740> that<00:03:35.950> does<00:03:36.130> work<00:03:36.310> and

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
well I tried that that does work and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.090 
well I tried that that does work and
here's<00:03:37.030> where<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.240> named<00:03:37.650> fountain<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.890> it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
here's where I named fountain and it

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.550 
here's where I named fountain and it
appended<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.580> Dodgers<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.209> 1:02<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.320> each

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
appended the Dodgers and 1:02 for each

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.160 
appended the Dodgers and 1:02 for each
additional<00:03:41.920> instance<00:03:42.580> of<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.540> object<00:03:44.050> the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
additional instance of the object the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.690 
additional instance of the object the
cup<00:03:44.320> place<00:03:44.530> with<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.890> name<00:03:45.010> fountain<00:03:45.489> and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
cup place with the name fountain and

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.020 
cup place with the name fountain and
then<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.600> normal<00:03:46.870> factor<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.739> normal<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
then the normal factor the normal is the

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.060 
then the normal factor the normal is the
rate<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.630> which<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.050> particles<00:03:50.500> emit<00:03:50.860> from

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
rate at which the particles emit from

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.320 
rate at which the particles emit from
the<00:03:51.220> face<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.670> perpendicular<00:03:51.970> direction

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
the face in a perpendicular direction

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.680 
the face in a perpendicular direction
that's<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.110> mathematical<00:03:53.320> term<00:03:54.060> alright<00:03:55.060> so

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
that's a mathematical term alright so

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.240 
that's a mathematical term alright so
and<00:03:56.080> then<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.950> other<00:03:57.190> thing<00:03:57.730> was<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:59.130> mist<00:04:00.130> if

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
and then the other thing was the mist if

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.320 
and then the other thing was the mist if
you<00:04:00.310> can<00:04:00.400> see<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.880> here<00:04:02.850> look<00:04:03.850> down<00:04:04.060> here

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
you can see it in here look down here

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.420 
you can see it in here look down here
right<00:04:04.660> here<00:04:05.020> I<00:04:05.110> added<00:04:05.530> an<00:04:05.620> empty<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.160> scene

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
right here I added an empty to the scene

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.410 
right here I added an empty to the scene
and<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:09.570> from<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.720> empty<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:12.090> had<00:04:13.090> gone<00:04:13.270> over

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
and then from the empty I had gone over

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.280 
and then from the empty I had gone over
to<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.660> physics<00:04:13.989> button<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:15.760> added<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.290> this

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
to the physics button and I added a this

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.710 
to the physics button and I added a this
magnetic<00:04:18.010> force<00:04:18.310> field<00:04:18.640> like<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.270> wanted

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
magnetic force field like this I wanted

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.030 
magnetic force field like this I wanted
to<00:04:19.780> show<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:19.989> again<00:04:20.260> I'll<00:04:20.410> just<00:04:20.560> turn<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.919> off

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
to show you again I'll just turn it off

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.250 
to show you again I'll just turn it off
I<00:04:21.310> added<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> force<00:04:21.850> field<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.990> went<00:04:23.169> up

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
I added the force field and I went up

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.080 
I added the force field and I went up
here<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.680> picked<00:04:23.890> magnetic<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.550> that's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
here and I picked magnetic and that's

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.640 
here and I picked magnetic and that's
all<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.300> had<00:04:25.419> done<00:04:25.600> so<00:04:25.840> now<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.169> particles

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
all I had done so now when the particles

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.350 
all I had done so now when the particles
otherwise<00:04:27.490> they<00:04:27.789> would<00:04:27.910> go

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
otherwise they would go

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.689 
otherwise they would go
right<00:04:28.509> up<00:04:28.659> Vector<00:04:29.620> let's<00:04:29.889> actually<00:04:30.400> let's

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
right up Vector let's actually let's

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:31.830 
right up Vector let's actually let's
just<00:04:30.849> turn<00:04:30.969> it<00:04:31.060> off<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.210> see<00:04:31.449> what<00:04:31.539> happens

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
just turn it off and see what happens

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.809 
just turn it off and see what happens
I'll<00:04:31.990> turn<00:04:32.169> it<00:04:32.289> off<00:04:32.409> and<00:04:32.710> you'll<00:04:33.340> see<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.699> the

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
I'll turn it off and you'll see that the

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.809 
I'll turn it off and you'll see that the
particles<00:04:34.710> when<00:04:35.710> they<00:04:35.740> cycle<00:04:36.250> around<00:04:36.430> for<00:04:36.729> the

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
particles when they cycle around for the

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.649 
particles when they cycle around for the
next<00:04:37.379> run<00:04:38.939> it<00:04:39.939> would<00:04:40.030> be<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> fountain

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
next run it would be like a fountain

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.230 
next run it would be like a fountain
they<00:04:41.349> just<00:04:41.590> run<00:04:41.770> straight<00:04:42.069> up<00:04:42.129> following<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
they just run straight up following the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.240 
they just run straight up following the
normal<00:04:43.599> of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> plane<00:04:45.719> and<00:04:46.719> then<00:04:47.650> when<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.800> so

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
normal of the plane and then when I so

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.619 
normal of the plane and then when I so
you<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.490> experiment<00:04:48.939> with<00:04:49.240> these<00:04:49.330> force

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:49.629 
you can experiment with these force

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.820 
you can experiment with these force
fields<00:04:49.960> all<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.199> want<00:04:50.379> and<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:50.620> whatever

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
fields all you want and that whatever

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.709 
fields all you want and that whatever
you<00:04:51.039> want<00:04:51.340> let's<00:04:51.669> put<00:04:51.909> we<00:04:52.030> could<00:04:52.150> put<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.330> vortex

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:52.719 
you want let's put we could put a vortex

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.270 
you want let's put we could put a vortex
in<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:53.050> it'll<00:04:53.500> immediately<00:04:53.710> start

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
in there it'll immediately start

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.679 
in there it'll immediately start
spinning<00:04:54.550> it<00:04:54.699> because<00:04:54.939> the<00:04:55.000> force<00:04:55.240> fields<00:04:55.569> up

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
spinning it because the force fields up

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.740 
spinning it because the force fields up
there<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:57.580> that's<00:04:58.030> not<00:04:58.270> what<00:04:58.419> we'll<00:04:58.539> be

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
there so but that's not what we'll be

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.330 
there so but that's not what we'll be
using<00:04:58.780> when<00:04:59.289> we<00:04:59.319> actually<00:04:59.530> make<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.919> lot<00:05:00.159> of<00:05:00.250> the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
using when we actually make a lot of the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.860 
using when we actually make a lot of the
fountain<00:05:00.669> effects<00:05:00.939> because<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.270> can<00:05:01.419> will

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
fountain effects because you can will

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.350 
fountain effects because you can will
use<00:05:02.110> sine<00:05:02.469> waves<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:04.060> know<00:05:04.180> we'll

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
use sine waves and you know we'll

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.390 
use sine waves and you know we'll
control<00:05:04.750> which<00:05:05.110> one<00:05:05.319> of<00:05:05.349> these<00:05:05.500> fires<00:05:06.009> first

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
control which one of these fires first

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.070 
control which one of these fires first
and<00:05:06.879> then<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.240> rate<00:05:07.419> at<00:05:07.539> which<00:05:07.569> they<00:05:07.870> fire

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
and then the rate at which they fire

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.230 
and then the rate at which they fire
relative<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.919> each<00:05:09.039> other<00:05:09.279> and<00:05:09.610> things<00:05:10.120> of

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
relative to each other and things of

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.980 
relative to each other and things of
that<00:05:10.330> nature

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
that nature

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.170 
that nature
you<00:05:11.169> know<00:05:11.289> this<00:05:11.620> these<00:05:12.189> kind<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.580> effects<00:05:12.969> are

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
you know this these kind of effects are

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.300 
you know this these kind of effects are
fairly<00:05:13.990> random<00:05:14.680> you<00:05:14.800> can<00:05:14.949> make<00:05:15.069> them<00:05:15.189> look

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
fairly random you can make them look

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.129 
fairly random you can make them look
good<00:05:15.520> in<00:05:15.699> some<00:05:15.909> cases<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:16.479> we<00:05:16.599> want<00:05:16.779> a<00:05:16.870> little

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
good in some cases but we want a little

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.390 
good in some cases but we want a little
more<00:05:17.289> precision<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:18.099> our<00:05:18.759> FX<00:05:19.090> all<00:05:19.330> right<00:05:19.449> so

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
more precision in our FX all right so

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.040 
more precision in our FX all right so
let's<00:05:21.400> see<00:05:21.580> let's<00:05:21.759> go<00:05:21.879> back<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.330> magnetic

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
let's see let's go back to the magnetic

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.999 
let's see let's go back to the magnetic
effect<00:05:23.169> that's<00:05:23.500> okay<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:25.319> if<00:05:26.319> we<00:05:26.469> go<00:05:26.710> back<00:05:26.860> to

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
effect that's okay and if we go back to

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.230 
effect that's okay and if we go back to
the<00:05:27.099> scripting<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.699> then<00:05:27.939> let<00:05:28.029> me<00:05:28.090> see<00:05:28.180> if

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
the scripting and then let me see if

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.459 
the scripting and then let me see if
they<00:05:28.300> had<00:05:28.539> anything<00:05:28.719> else<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.139> code<00:05:29.319> in

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
they had anything else to the code in

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.800 
they had anything else to the code in
this<00:05:29.620> case<00:05:29.860> now<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.969> only<00:05:31.180> other<00:05:31.270> thing<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.629> did

I commented out our our conditional
statement<00:05:34.990> from<00:05:35.529> the<00:05:35.620> previous<00:05:35.979> lesson<00:05:36.159> well

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
just let you take a look at this code

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.939 
just let you take a look at this code
because<00:05:40.509> for<00:05:40.960> those<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.289> you<00:05:41.500> who<00:05:41.800> are

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
because for those of you who are

because for those of you who are
familiar<00:05:42.610> with<00:05:42.819> blender<00:05:43.270> this<00:05:43.629> is<00:05:43.810> pretty

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
familiar with blender this is pretty

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.450 
familiar with blender this is pretty
much<00:05:44.139> all<00:05:44.319> you<00:05:44.349> need<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.800> get<00:05:44.919> started<00:05:45.370> because

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
then you can start adding in your own

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.649 
then you can start adding in your own
features<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:48.699> that<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:49.060> there's<00:05:49.210> enough<00:05:49.509> for

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
features to that and there's enough for

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.450 
features to that and there's enough for
you<00:05:49.719> to<00:05:49.810> just<00:05:50.529> go<00:05:50.710> running<00:05:50.949> with<00:05:51.129> it<00:05:51.159> at<00:05:51.370> this

with the next lesson and we'll start
doing<00:05:57.279> more<00:05:57.460> mathematics<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.529> more<00:05:59.529> features

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
doing more mathematics and more features

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.569 
doing more mathematics and more features
as<00:06:00.129> well<00:06:00.310> alright<00:06:00.849> and<00:06:01.089> I'll<00:06:01.180> see<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.419> then
