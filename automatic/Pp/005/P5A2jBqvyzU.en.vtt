 and in pleer.ru this is the league website 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.070
 civilization league international but 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.910
 Russian developers and they did everything 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.399
 very good 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.559

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.040
 check in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.769
 in the evening the site slows down a bit 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.160
 quite popular well here as usual 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:43.690

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.609

 by email is not required but if you 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.149
 still need sometime 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.719
 restore password 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.569
 and it may be better to enter email 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.609
 your real news subscription is not 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:02.640
 need all the news is on the main 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.000
 page or news section 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 register well we are banned now 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 we enter 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 after entering you will be offered to buy gold 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.490
 account or otherwise support 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.050
 project creators and you can 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.540
 really support this business 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.020
 noble because they did 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.740
 good convenient multiplayer system 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.590
 then go to the main page 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.090
 go to the download section and in the section 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.119
 downloads download 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.560
 our cog with the client is obligatory 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.800
 use this customer in this 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.350
 the client already has its network component 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.030
 by the way if you before yuzali hamachi 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.770
 or tunngle delete will only interfere and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 I prefer to delete the last client 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.039
 civilization you no longer need 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.220
 there is a single about it 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:04.179
 and multi everything works fine also 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.479
 need to download this one here fix language 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.489
 also useful to download torrent 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.400
 I will not explain to you I think everyone knows 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.590
 yourself after you downloaded from us 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.560
 Set file appears 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 we run it and install it ourselves 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.150
 figure here is nothing complicated think 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.170
 everyone knows how to put the game and the only thing 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.360
 the only nuance in the installation process 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.060
 You will be prompted to install a new network. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.850
 connection you agree with this 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.900
 click yes install then you 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.810
 your firewall will offer to transfer to 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.549
 trusted network connection itself 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.670
 civilization will also need this 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.310
 do everything to work after 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.910
 installation tsiva you do not run it 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.880
 if you run then close and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.890
 start the installation and juice fix 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.310
 just like dumping it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.950
 install in the same folder and if 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.700
 you will have some problems with 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.790
 setting 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.230
 not enough rights for example you run 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.440
 install as administrator further 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.460
 all set but still run figure 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.640
 early 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:24.130
 go to the folder with the game is usually in c 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.020
 program files of 7 civilizations 5 too 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.870
 interesting moment many say traces 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.690
 tires 5 need to say either cisco 5 or 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 civilizations five strange thing okay 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 open files if 213 select player 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.780
 name 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.140
 choose a language and save it is your 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.930
 nickname in the game is displayed well 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.190
 what is the language of the game 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.470
 such a nuance sometimes the file is not saved 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.800
 if so try again open 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.470
 him as administrator we have this 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.810
 can not be done but well the most important and 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.180
 effective option how to save a file 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.970
 if it is not saved if no rights or 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.020
 he is busy with another process 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.570
 its on the desktop 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.170
 there modify modify your nickname and 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.610
 select language and return ios replacements 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.950
 previous that is copied 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.830
 desktop in the game replacement folder 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.600
 all we have installed the game installed 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.860
 fix network component installed 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.260
 selected nick launch launcher or from 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.740
 folders with a game or shortcut so working 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.390
 of the table 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.090
 I have already chosen both nickname and password 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.120
 enter it when you start there everything is very 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 just not going to explain 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.640
 direct x 11 if you want to enjoy 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.040
 all the charms of graphics and numbers and if 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.620
 allows you your iron if you have 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.530
 graphics card is weak put direct x9 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.520
 otherwise, because of your lags will be lagged 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.550
 multiplayer all 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.110
 the system is such that one is one but if one 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.640
 someone lags believe farther 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.910
 auto power up network game at startup 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.770
 games it is necessary to put add to 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.430
 autoloading is not necessary that is if 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.440
 want that when you turn on the computer 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.920
 cypher network opened you can 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.810
 put do not want no do not put 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:26.420
 You can always launch a launcher from a shortcut 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:30.440
 on the desktop we go so I immediately 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:34.140
 I'll make the figure lower 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.170
 civilization has time to have such a nuance 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.990
 the network game is here the more 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.520
 people with the ability to host the better and 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.740
 moreover if from for example 8 people 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.050
 four host can not be 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.660
 big problems in a network game 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.690
 if they can host five of play 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.390
 these choices are simply impossible because 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.750
 the host that creates the lobby is he alone but in 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.230
 Compound game hold each hastas 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.880
 second 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.800
 that is , every second player holds 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.620
 connected to another player and 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.870
 take the connection with your 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.870
 mate so to speak because all by 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.570
 pairs even if you are an odd number 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.180
 man passionately on version four 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.250
 should and should be an opportunity 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.380
 run the game you with open ports and 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.450
 transferred by them both open or 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.320
 I will transfer ports in 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.730
 next video 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.660
 here we finally have the games 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.560
 local network 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:42.200
 but we are now in the numbers from cooking 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:45.960
 these players are playing here right now 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.900
 the rules of numbers are just such that we are not 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.700
 we can go into the game that we do not know 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.990
 that is, we theoretically connect 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.510
 but we can from here or kick right away 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.950
 or asked to leave 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.000
 Wow, this is not even asked well 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.600
 still we will not 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.910
 to disturb people 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.620
 in the rules on the site cyc pleer.ru 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.110
 It is written that in the games that you do not know 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.370
 can not even often do not write 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:14.470

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.300
 or come on guys 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:23.050
 go creating a game is very simple we 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:25.330
 write the name of the lobby any 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:28.180
 setup we put simultaneous this one 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.600
 for the network game is very very useful 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.640
 just monstrous and for the network game 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.260
 just need to leave the croupier to 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.520
 could persist if someone 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.350
 flew and croup there type well in general so that 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.120
 you could then go to the croupier playing it 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.590
 and but still no one 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.840
 don't play you like someone 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.750
