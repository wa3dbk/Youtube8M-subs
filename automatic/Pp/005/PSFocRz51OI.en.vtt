worldî and today I'm going to touching
your<00:00:09.809> quite<00:00:09.960> basic<00:00:10.410> intermediate<00:00:10.920> trick

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
your quite basic intermediate trick

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.509 
your quite basic intermediate trick
called<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.660> s<00:00:12.990> all<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.590> behind<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.370> knees

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
called the a s all be behind the knees

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.609 
called the a s all be behind the knees
across<00:00:15.000> which<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.839> they're<00:00:16.170> basically

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
across which is they're basically

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.650 
across which is they're basically
recently<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.980> including<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
recently I'm for that including a lot of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.990 
recently I'm for that including a lot of
tricks<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:22.949> more<00:00:23.070> difficult<00:00:23.519> because

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
tricks which are more difficult because

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.519 
tricks which are more difficult because
the<00:00:24.180> way<00:00:24.269> trick<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> divide<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.260> divided

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the way trick to divide up I divided

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
the way trick to divide up I divided
into<00:00:25.800> four<00:00:26.010> skill<00:00:26.279> levels<00:00:26.609> level<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.060> two

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
into four skill levels level one two

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.960 
into four skill levels level one two
three<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> four<00:00:27.960> oh<00:00:28.170> four<00:00:28.680> being<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.820> most

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
three and four oh four being the most

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.139 
three and four oh four being the most
advanced<00:00:30.300> tricks<00:00:31.520> usually<00:00:32.520> incorporating

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
advanced tricks usually incorporating

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.740 
advanced tricks usually incorporating
most<00:00:33.420> lunders<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> those<00:00:34.739> power<00:00:34.980> skills<00:00:35.340> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
most lunders and those power skills and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.299 
most lunders and those power skills and
level<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.899> being<00:00:37.170> footwork<00:00:37.500> level<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.070> being

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
level one being footwork level two being

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
level one being footwork level two being
most<00:00:38.520> sorts<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.410> intermediate<00:00:40.410> crosses<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
most sorts of intermediate crosses so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.049 
most sorts of intermediate crosses so
I'm<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> ACE<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.850> level<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.840> skill<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
I'm the ACE is a level two skill and

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.130 
I'm the ACE is a level two skill and
this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> looks<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.629> from<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> back

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
this is what it looks like from the back

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.799 
this is what it looks like from the back
because<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> best<00:00:46.829> place<00:00:47.039> show<00:00:47.250> from

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:01:02.270 

and<00:00:54.469> front

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.580 

okay<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.880> that's<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.290> S<00:01:07.440> it's<00:01:08.440> not<00:01:08.530> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
okay so that's the S it's not a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.050 
okay so that's the S it's not a
particularly<00:01:09.010> difficult<00:01:09.160> trick<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.729> do<00:01:09.850> if

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
particularly difficult trick to do if

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.240 
particularly difficult trick to do if
you're<00:01:10.720> flexible<00:01:11.229> enough<00:01:11.530> but<00:01:12.130> I'm<00:01:12.190> just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
you're flexible enough but I'm just

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.950 
you're flexible enough but I'm just
going<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.640> show<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.000> sort<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.390> how<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.690> do<00:01:13.900> it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
going to show you sort of how to do it

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.609 
going to show you sort of how to do it
basically<00:01:15.510> what<00:01:16.510> you<00:01:16.600> want<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.140> where

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
basically what you want to do is where

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.850 
basically what you want to do is where
the<00:01:17.710> rope<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.340> here<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.440> lot<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.470> people<00:01:20.740> it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
the rope is here a lot of people it

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.090 
the rope is here a lot of people it
helps<00:01:21.070> them<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:22.060> slow<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:22.390> down<00:01:22.420> here<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.100> then

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
helps them to slow it down here and then

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.100 
helps them to slow it down here and then
just<00:01:25.259> read<00:01:26.259> one<00:01:26.410> ease<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:28.840> practice

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
just read one ease you can just practice

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.469 
just read one ease you can just practice
that<00:01:29.410> just<00:01:29.650> get<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.640> there<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.119> then<00:01:31.240> look<00:01:31.390> at

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
that just get it there and then look at

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.310 
that just get it there and then look at
what<00:01:31.600> your<00:01:31.720> hands<00:01:32.020> on<00:01:32.140> your<00:01:32.290> hands<00:01:32.740> are<00:01:32.800> here

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
what your hands on your hands are here

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.660 
what your hands on your hands are here
500<00:01:35.320> knees<00:01:35.440> that's<00:01:36.009> probably<00:01:36.250> not<00:01:36.369> no<00:01:36.460> easy

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
500 knees that's probably not no easy

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
500 knees that's probably not no easy
enough<00:01:36.820> make<00:01:37.390> sure<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:37.720> really<00:01:37.990> big<00:01:38.410> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
enough make sure it's really big and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
enough make sure it's really big and
then<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.890> jump<00:01:39.369> quite<00:01:39.700> high<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.240> if<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.840> just

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
then you jump quite high so if you just

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.609 
then you jump quite high so if you just
want<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.200> try<00:01:41.320> well<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.570> here<00:01:43.720> so

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
want to try well I just get it here so

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.680 
want to try well I just get it here so
you're<00:01:44.740> crossing<00:01:44.950> at<00:01:45.250> your<00:01:45.340> forearms<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.940> you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
you're crossing at your forearms and you

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.170 
you're crossing at your forearms and you
can<00:01:46.869> see<00:01:47.080> your<00:01:47.530> fists<00:01:48.039> crossing<00:01:48.940> at<00:01:49.060> your

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
can see your fists crossing at your

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.100 
can see your fists crossing at your
knees<00:01:49.300> make<00:01:49.570> sure<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.750> knees<00:01:49.869> are<00:01:50.020> together

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
knees make sure you knees are together

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.219 
knees make sure you knees are together
so<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.800> can<00:01:50.920> get<00:01:51.039> out<00:01:51.190> really<00:01:51.789> well<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.270> then

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
so you can get out really well and then

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.980 
so you can get out really well and then
just<00:01:53.380> jump<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:55.240> people<00:01:55.479> find<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.690> hard<00:01:55.899> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
just jump some people find it hard to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.529 
just jump some people find it hard to
get<00:01:56.170> over<00:01:56.410> their<00:01:56.560> head<00:01:56.710> but<00:01:57.009> if<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.060> keep<00:01:58.330> them

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
get over their head but if you keep them

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.900 
get over their head but if you keep them
mental<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:58.960> from<00:01:59.140> there<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.640> should<00:02:00.759> be

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
mental in from there and it should be

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.600 
mental in from there and it should be
all<00:02:01.000> right<00:02:01.950> little<00:02:02.950> finger<00:02:03.009> motion<00:02:03.399> struck

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
all right little finger motion struck

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.430 
all right little finger motion struck
quite<00:02:03.759> difficult<00:02:03.940> is<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> fact<00:02:04.599> that<00:02:04.660> since

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
quite difficult is the fact that since

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.309 
quite difficult is the fact that since
you're<00:02:05.619> quite<00:02:05.800> low<00:02:05.979> down<00:02:06.840> there<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.289> a

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
you're quite low down there you have a

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.250 
you're quite low down there you have a
log<00:02:08.619> rope<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.220> jump<00:02:09.459> over<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.899> best<00:02:11.050> way<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
log rope to jump over so the best way to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.710 
log rope to jump over so the best way to
do<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.860> sorta<00:02:12.130> jerk<00:02:12.340> if<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.240> stop

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
do this is sorta jerk if you just stop

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600

straight into it it doesn't matter which

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.380 
straight into it it doesn't matter which
hands<00:02:39.319> really<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.769> top<00:02:40.120> unless<00:02:41.120> you're<00:02:41.769> doing

what's<00:02:44.390> called<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.750> weave<00:02:45.129> which<00:02:46.129> is<00:02:46.280> where<00:02:46.489> you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
what's called a weave which is where you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.170 
what's called a weave which is where you
swap<00:02:47.840> your<00:02:47.870> hands<00:02:48.170> around<00:02:48.290> like<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:52.180> which

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
swap your hands around like this which

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.569 
swap your hands around like this which
is<00:02:53.560> done<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> same<00:02:54.860> way<00:02:54.920> as<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:55.280> would<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.549> a

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
is done the same way as you would do a

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.490 
is done the same way as you would do a
cross<00:02:55.909> cross<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.860> stroke<00:02:59.019> but<00:03:00.019> behind<00:03:00.260> these

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
cross cross this stroke but behind these

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.550 
cross cross this stroke but behind these
but<00:03:00.799> it's<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.790> little<00:03:02.000> trick<00:03:02.230> which<00:03:03.230> doesn't

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
but it's a little trick which doesn't

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.699 
but it's a little trick which doesn't
actually<00:03:03.650> look<00:03:03.920> all<00:03:04.519> together<00:03:04.790> right<00:03:05.690> good<00:03:05.900> so

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
actually look all together right good so

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.110 
actually look all together right good so
just<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.950> little<00:03:07.040> variation<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.879> do<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.090> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
just a little variation you can do on it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.569 
just a little variation you can do on it
and<00:03:08.769> that's<00:03:09.769> how<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.010> did<00:03:10.129> yes<00:03:10.370> that's

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
and that's how you did yes that's

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.030 
and that's how you did yes that's
watching
