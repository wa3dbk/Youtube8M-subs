it open that's a model of the sub woofer

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
it open that's a model of the sub woofer
of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.430> bass<00:00:59.609> box<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> comes

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of the bass box and you can see it comes

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
of the bass box and you can see it comes
with<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> things<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
with a lot of things to do this you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.700 
with a lot of things to do this you
don't<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> play<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.409> any<00:01:04.589> of

don't really need to play with any of
these<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.970> minimize

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
these things so you can just minimize

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.010 
these things so you can just minimize
out<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.119> box<00:01:09.390> selected

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
out of all of them so with box selected

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
out of all of them so with box selected
we're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.619> mograph<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> fracked

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
we're going to go to mograph and fracked

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.320 
we're going to go to mograph and fracked
your<00:01:12.689> object<00:01:13.340> we're<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> click<00:01:14.700> box<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to open that up and then as you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
going to open that up and then as you
see<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> lot<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.189> craziness<00:01:50.700> right

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
see you get a lot of craziness right

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
see you get a lot of craziness right
here<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:52.560> scroll<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.159> this

here and to just scroll down on this

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.130 
here and to just scroll down on this
curve<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> don't<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.689> craziness

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
curve if you don't want this craziness

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.370 
curve if you don't want this craziness
you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.920> click<00:01:56.100> strength<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.170> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can click strength and then you just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
you can click strength and then you just
want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.100> strength<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.759> lot<00:02:00.090> smaller

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
want to make your strength a lot smaller

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
want to make your strength a lot smaller
summer<00:02:00.990> around<00:02:01.469> 15<00:02:02.009> or<00:02:02.250> maybe<00:02:02.399> 10<00:02:02.930> then<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
summer around 15 or maybe 10 then as you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.320 
summer around 15 or maybe 10 then as you
can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.700> makes<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.450> less

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
can see it makes it look less

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.359 
can see it makes it look less
unrealistic<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.840> then<00:02:09.740> just<00:02:10.009> keep<00:02:10.160> on

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
to turn it over a bit and then maybe

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.390 
to turn it over a bit and then maybe

this<00:02:33.319> because<00:02:33.680> my<00:02:33.709> computer<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.400> laggy

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
this because my computer is really laggy

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.410 
this because my computer is really laggy
but<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.890> subwoofer<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.270> beat

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
but the subwoofer is going to the beat

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.020 
but the subwoofer is going to the beat
of<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.660> song<00:02:39.340> even<00:02:40.340> if<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.610> song<00:02:40.820> isn't

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
of the song even if the song isn't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.750 
of the song even if the song isn't
playing<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.660> then<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:43.040> basically<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.610> for

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
playing and then that's basically it for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.610 
playing and then that's basically it for
