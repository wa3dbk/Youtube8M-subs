may<00:00:25.590> agree<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.460> really<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:27.330> simple<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
may agree it's really really simple to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.500 
may agree it's really really simple to
use<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.510> involving

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
use but it's just so involving

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
use but it's just so involving
encouraging<00:00:31.470> everybody<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.460> involved<00:00:32.820> in

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
encouraging everybody to get involved in

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.610 
encouraging everybody to get involved in
this<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.899> fun<00:00:34.020> game<00:00:34.559> but

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this and it's just a really fun game but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
this and it's just a really fun game but
it's<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.100> hard<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> same<00:00:36.000> time<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it's really hard at the same time so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.810 
it's really hard at the same time so
like<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> mentioned<00:00:37.829> before<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.550> two

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
like I mentioned before this is two

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
like I mentioned before this is two
spoke<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.270> ages<00:00:39.540> twelve<00:00:39.809> plus<00:00:40.079> means<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
spoke for ages twelve plus means a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
spoke for ages twelve plus means a
minimum<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.129> 2<00:00:41.370> players<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.969> play<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.300> game

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
minimum of 2 players to play this game

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
minimum of 2 players to play this game
and<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> form<00:00:44.219> two<00:00:44.579> teams

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and that when you have to form two teams

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
and that when you have to form two teams
so<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.480> player<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.020> each<00:00:46.200> team

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so if you have one player on each team

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
so if you have one player on each team
that's<00:00:46.739> perfectly<00:00:47.219> fine<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that's perfectly fine but there has to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
that's perfectly fine but there has to
be<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.629> answering<00:00:49.530> team<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.370> questioning

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
be an answering team and a questioning

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
be an answering team and a questioning
team<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.379> instead<00:00:52.739> lift<00:00:53.070> up
