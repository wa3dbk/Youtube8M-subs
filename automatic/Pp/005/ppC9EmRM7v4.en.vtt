00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 today we offer you a derby a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 clasico alex welch stuttgart against 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.370
 munich the class and control the series 3 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.580
 so which one to choose is the match 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580
 present-day 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 it's very simple the bmw series 3 as 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.579
 the broken mistress are the weights 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 heavy of their respective brands 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.180
 it's the best sellers exactly then 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.320
 for that we made it very simple 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.730
 also we took the engines 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 almost the most popular 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.100
 for both fleets and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.720
 special 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.699
 let's start with the last come the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.079
 mercedes class c so this is the 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.210
 new generation obviously is a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 as in the current trend 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.940
 automobile is called upon a whole 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 new lightweight platform with 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 the massive use of aluminum 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.070
 but what strikes basically on 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 this new sedan is its design 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.789
 mercedes have largely dusted it off and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.469
 we can really welcome the blow of 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.640
 new generation pencil that I have 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.600
 the impression that it skates a little 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.769
 style level 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 actually it's more of an evolution 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.230
 at the aesthetic level compared to the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.510
 previous generation 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.769
 it's classy and elegant but there is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.270
 no risk taking compared to the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.039
 class and against it must be noted that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.899
 the design is a bit older 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.300
 but that does not prevent this series 3 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.869
 to be slightly less heavy to 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.869
 equivalent motorization 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.940
 classic outside but also 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.860
 classic inside the regulars the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.060
 bmw series 3 will not be disoriented 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.260
 I feel like it's a little bit 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.720
 problem of the rainbow as she 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.710
 often addresses that regulars it's 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.450
 true that it misses a little bit of fans 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.520
 it lacks a little daring but we 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 can not remove him as his finish and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.390
 the choice of materials remain tip top 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.860
 at the multimedia level which is very 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.660
 Well, it represents roughly 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.650
 the same functions as the mercedes but 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.570
 it's much easier to understand 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 for a novice exactly at the level of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.800
 the livability at the front so that's 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 true that it's a little more narrow at 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.110
 knee space by cons at 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.220
 the back both at the level of the guard at 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.120
 roof of legroom 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's royal to travel so you see 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.510
 here it's totally the reverse we have 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.070
 something qualitative that reflects 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.270
 truly the upscale aspect you 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 put money but you have it for your 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 money the materials are noble this is 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.900
 well done 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.830
 the dashboard and modern not 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.030
 really feel like being on board 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.350
 of a mini that the room is you believe 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.149
 not so well say since she takes over 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.070
 a lot of equipment at your level of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.350
 multimedia than active security 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.540
 what we will note is at the level of 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.760
 connectivity then ok mercedes offers 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.850
 a super large screen touch wheel 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.310
 a great pavement all that dedicated to the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.780
 functionality ease of use 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.360
 except that the problem is that it's a 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 is serving a punishment to use harscouet 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.390
 at this point really it really takes 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.590
 be briefed by the seller or by 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.310
 someone from mercedes before to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.220
 to be able to master it 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.820
 that's not like that a novice is going 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.440
 really galley 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.540
 so we're really good at the advanced 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 comfortable we are well maintained by 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.940
 against at the back there is a real 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.680
 problem huh we have a problem of custody 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.269
 at the roof is also at the knees 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.950
 it's much less than attracting 3 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.820
 yet that exactly short and the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.400
 chest volume 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.390
 it is also a bit disappointing since 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.920
 as you say she is shorter 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.920
 he is at the same level 480 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.550
 so welcome to the edge of the new 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.110
 class c it's fine so she says there 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.720
 not very welcoming back is 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.550
 comfortable well suspended all and well 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.930
 soundproofed with anguish and a capsule 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.030
 exactly we can not say that this 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.280
 engine is a warlord it's not 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.570
 something sporty but here it is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060
 fills the job is a 4-cylinder diesel 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.860
 which makes 170 horses a sufficient couple 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.090
 to move the large mass of the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 car is all we ask 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.880
 and we have something felt and a 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.110
 retirement driving or as 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.100
 amortization 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.500
 it better absorbs exactly our 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.530
 version of a chassis adjustment system 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.060
 called agility then there you can 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.240
 set several driving modes more 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.800
 in philosophy a faster direction 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.840
 depreciation more or less then that's 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.360
 this system was not revolutionary 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 but you there too at bmw on the series 3 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.080
 here but in the end the you of the box 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.270
 so at the box level that's what 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.830
 fish a little bit in relation to zf 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.959
 at eight reports that equips Bern 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.700
 if you have a 7g tronic plus that starts 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.040
 to see some have at once it's been 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.510
 a little bit better at the level of 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.170
 passage time fastness but that's 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.170
 still not at the level 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.230
 a little bit noisy what there a 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.610
 ten a little bit a cold like to 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.099
 hot even punishment 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.319
 so we know it so it's the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.560
 320 d version with 2-liter turbo core 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.470
 4-cylinder diesel of 184 horsepower and 380 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.060
 classic km 1 it's true it's very 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.250
 definitely from yes quite it is 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.260
 especially especially well served by 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.990
 this automatic gearbox to 8 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.570
 reports an option an option at 2200 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 euros but a check option has 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.750
 really really really nice 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.610
 especially it goes well with the spirit of the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.220
 car 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.460
 chassis side is bmw ie 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.350
 it's precise it's sporty or 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 sports nice to drive 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.240
 on the other hand, there is a price to pay 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.110
 it's a little dry on some 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.389
 imperfections of the road 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.120
 okay but in the end we have a sedan 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.280
 a little dynamic but that may be 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.280
 a little impatient barely compliant 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 no surprise so for her to me 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.970
 lift series 3 but she keeps them 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.860
 qualities of the models that preceded it 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.570
 this well finished is sober 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.950
 it's sober and it's a behavior 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.990
 very nice dynamic to drive 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.760
 exactly but I want to say for 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.840
 this kind of vehicle ie 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.280
 four-cylinder diesel this is not the 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.050
 sportiness we're looking for here 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.790
 preferred the behavior a bit more 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.560
 cool and a little more typical comfort of the 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.600
 new class and knowing that in this 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.520
 mercedes domain and this is to be emphasized a 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.990
 is making tremendous progress in 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.790
 calibration if we really want to 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.530
 something sports class and 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.090
 will answer now now with regard to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.860
 regards the presentation the finish the 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.000
 sobriety is kif kif kaftan I 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.460
 want to say maybe a notch to 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.260
 above and prices the rates the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.260
 rates that's pretty much the same thing the 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.300
 bmw series 3 has a slight advantage but there 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.190
 Nor has 45000 euros difference 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.720
 exactly and that's why if you 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.010
 look for this kind of vehicle this is the 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.010
 new class and that new how
