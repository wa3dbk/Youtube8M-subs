00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.680
 let's go face 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.080
 the ones with the highest height 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.390
 they can only observe because a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 team that can quietly be the 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.529
 first of america for the same class 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.690
 that we have and hopefully finish at 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.740
 first phase with other effectively 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.110
 is completing is in the polygon 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.330
 CiorÃ¡n of the defense and thank God 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.680
 I have the ability to play 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 on the right on the left and now 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 now the central one and that can give a lot 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 joy in which the one who looks 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 reflected in each of the parties 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.379
 that explore always mentions in account and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.500
 he also considered it an advantage 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.030
 for this port to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.649
 the coaching staff to follow from some 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 the characteristic because in any 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 they can break 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480
 it's a situation but it feels comfortable 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.980
 in all positions and there is one more 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.090
 that another how I feel like him 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.160
 the positions that tilt 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.650
 we already using the day to 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.239
 keep improving by pressing to continue 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.970
 correcting 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.159
 the errors are normal and day by day 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.909
 it will continue to gain more confidence 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.310
 more security regardless of 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.270
 race the final of the tournament as you feel 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.920
 the team very well I think if you knew 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.500
 how much had been done because I did not 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.750
 we played matches 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 of all against all the technical staff 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.730
 It has decided that they will not have the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.890
 team worth 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 in the final production they realize that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.290
 unlike the team has come 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.670
 from less to more we started in the tournament 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 I want us to make a strong team a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 solid team 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.130
 day by day it will be in each of the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.510
 parties we hope that with the help of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.990
 god let's finish the best 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.990
 way 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 planning what comes until now the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.630
 rival is cupcake union and analysis 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.010
 action of being a rival is a team that already 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.290
 we had the opportunity to face him 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.870
 his moment was won 30 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.540
 in the end that is part of another party 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.160
 another story there are other motivations is a 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.950
 team that has very good handling of 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.600
 ball that has an experienced goalkeeper 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.400
 that has experienced flyers that 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.140
 has a forward although already played a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.180
 team that the vast majority are players 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 that they were in first is a team 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.660
 that for years also has elusion 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.630
 will defend the first then I 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.280
 I think that if we touch with 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.350
 them in the final jon by that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
 america is in the father but from 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.880
 medium that is not necessary is going to be a 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880
 nice final is going to be a final what 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 it's going to be a lot of running a lot 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.430
 mystery and much delivery much 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.469
 sacrifice because they are also a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.299
 team that is a first and that also 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.969
 has aspirations after selling is called 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.010
 overconfidence and respecting 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.980
 the rivals see the team looking like 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.880
 champion 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.620
 I want to 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.730
 that's why they brought us to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.040
 to most players for this to 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.409
 that came a new coaching staff to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.260
 that material efforts were brought up 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.090
 this one to look towards the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.849
 rise to rise again American 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.890
 there we have the opportunity to have the 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.890
 champion and the big step now in the plan 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.390
 of the year and of course it is that I see my 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.900
 champion team and of course I already 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.849
 I visualize raising a cup and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.730
 starting the round with the team because 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.260
 we have worked it we have dreamed of 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.360
 and one we are very close and we hope that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.750
 with the help of God and with our help 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.750
 work
