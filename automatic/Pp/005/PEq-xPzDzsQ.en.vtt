00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
gonna be a fixed focal distance so I

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.700 
gonna be a fixed focal distance so I
want<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> try<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.570> each<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.170> spots

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
want to try and have each of my spots

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
want to try and have each of my spots
it's<00:01:26.490> close<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.380> distance<00:01:28.380> from<00:01:28.500> the

it's close to the same distance from the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.969 
it's close to the same distance from the
lens<00:01:29.180> focal<00:01:30.180> reasons<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.630> possible<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.890> now

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
lens focal reasons as possible so so now

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.870 
lens focal reasons as possible so so now
we're<00:01:32.100> gonna<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.340> back<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.549> we're<00:01:32.790> gonna
