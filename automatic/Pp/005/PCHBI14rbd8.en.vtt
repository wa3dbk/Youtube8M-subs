00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
the camera integrated in the revised

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.370 
the camera integrated in the revised
beautifully<00:01:32.390> with<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.570> poor<00:01:32.840> choice<00:01:33.140> of

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
beautifully with the poor choice of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.580 
beautifully with the poor choice of
things<00:01:33.680> 8<00:01:33.860> megapixel<00:01:34.610> camera<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.600> wonderful

things 8 megapixel camera the wonderful
optics<00:01:37.040> there

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
optics there

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.160 
optics there
they're<00:01:39.649> so<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.490> it's<00:01:40.700> it's<00:01:41.479> really<00:01:41.750> amazing

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
they're so that it's it's really amazing

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.830 
they're so that it's it's really amazing
how<00:01:42.560> good<00:01:42.799> push<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.579> product<00:01:43.850> loads<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:44.600> also

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
how good push the product loads but also

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.599 
how good push the product loads but also
you<00:01:45.049> know<00:01:45.289> how<00:01:45.439> good<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.710> feels<00:01:46.039> in<00:01:46.399> your<00:01:46.429> hand

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
you know how good it feels in your hand

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.760 
you know how good it feels in your hand
I<00:01:46.939> think<00:01:46.969> that<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:47.390> also<00:01:47.780> actually<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
I think that that's also actually the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.410 
I think that that's also actually the
next<00:01:49.009> thing<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.189> you<00:01:49.490> need<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> that's<00:01:49.969> use<00:01:50.210> it

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
next thing is you need to that's use it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.440 
next thing is you need to that's use it
in<00:01:50.569> your<00:01:50.689> own<00:01:50.719> hand<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.189> 1.4<00:01:53.090> gigahertz

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
in your own hand so it's a 1.4 gigahertz

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.929 
in your own hand so it's a 1.4 gigahertz
the<00:01:54.289> I<00:01:54.350> it's<00:01:54.500> running<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.039> 1<00:01:55.189> 1<00:01:55.429> point<00:01:55.640> 4

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
the I it's running the 1 1 point 4

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.740 
the I it's running the 1 1 point 4
gigahertz<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.959> processor<00:01:58.209> 512<00:01:59.209> megs<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.689> ram

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
gigahertz the processor 512 megs of ram

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.559 
gigahertz the processor 512 megs of ram
mix<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.679> ram<00:02:00.890> yeah<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:01.969> a<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:02.479> a

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
mix of ram yeah so this is a it's a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.840 
mix of ram yeah so this is a it's a
curved<00:02:02.929> screen<00:02:03.439> it's<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:04.039> curve<00:02:04.280> yeah<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
curved screen it's the curve yeah the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.940 
curved screen it's the curve yeah the
class<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.600> curve<00:02:05.869> from<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.229> from<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
class it's the curve from here from the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.030 
class it's the curve from here from the
corners<00:02:07.399> from<00:02:08.299> there<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:08.810> them<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.399> have

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
corners from there that them so we have

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.980 
corners from there that them so we have
so<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> charging<00:02:13.550> ports<00:02:13.910> yeah<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.810> then

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
so the charging ports yeah we have then

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.760 
so the charging ports yeah we have then
the<00:02:15.140> charging<00:02:15.590> port<00:02:15.740> there<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:17.770> yep
