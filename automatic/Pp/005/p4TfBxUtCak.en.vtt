00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.200 
particular workshop in San Francisco I'm
going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.120> be<00:01:06.240> working<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.780> fire<00:01:07.020> palm<00:01:07.350> or

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
going to be working on the fire palm or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
going to be working on the fire palm or
what<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.329> call<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.659> eight<00:01:09.780> mother<00:01:10.110> palms<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
what they call the eight mother palms of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
what they call the eight mother palms of
ba<00:01:10.829> gua<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> martial<00:01:11.700> arts<00:01:11.969> and<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.270> not

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ba gua and the martial arts and it's not

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.980 
ba gua and the martial arts and it's not
is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.869> fifth<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.250> sailing

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
is the fifth one it's sailing

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
is the fifth one it's sailing
qualification<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.790> gets<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
qualification is that it really gets the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.539 
qualification is that it really gets the
spirals<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> body<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.860> come<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
spirals of the body to come down to a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.560 
spirals of the body to come down to a
point<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.130> about<00:01:23.399> ultimately<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.539> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
point and it is about ultimately how you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.779 
point and it is about ultimately how you
activate<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.590> spiraling<00:01:26.250> currents<00:01:26.640> in

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
activate all the spiraling currents in

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.499 
activate all the spiraling currents in
yourself<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.450> outside<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> yourself<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.829> is

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
yourself and outside of yourself it is

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.389 
yourself and outside of yourself it is
naturally<00:01:30.509> match<00:01:30.750> within<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> Qigong<00:01:31.890> system

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
naturally match within the Qigong system

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.120 
naturally match within the Qigong system
I<00:01:32.520> teach<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.939> spiraling<00:01:33.390> energy<00:01:33.479> body<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.350> has

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
I teach the spiraling energy body it has

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
I teach the spiraling energy body it has
whole<00:01:35.670> ranges<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> applications<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.530> rather

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
whole ranges of applications and rather

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.099 
whole ranges of applications and rather
than<00:01:38.490> having<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.060> thousand<00:01:39.570> movements<00:01:39.990> about

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
than having a thousand movements about

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.200 
than having a thousand movements about
how<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> twist<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.700> twist<00:01:42.000> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
how you twist this way and twist that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
how you twist this way and twist that
way<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:42.600> forms<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.859> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
way which forms that go out the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
way which forms that go out the
sixty-four<00:01:44.700> separated<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.930> biggest

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
sixty-four separated out the biggest

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.569 
sixty-four separated out the biggest
thing<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.390> working<00:01:48.990> how

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
thing about it is that it is working how

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.899 
thing about it is that it is working how
spirals<00:01:50.579> work<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.500> very<00:01:52.679> tiny<00:01:53.549> ways

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
spirals work in very very very tiny ways

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
spirals work in very very very tiny ways
and<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.719> cause<00:01:55.560> everything<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and how they cause everything that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.840 
and how they cause everything that
spiral<00:01:56.939> literally<00:01:57.689> both<00:01:58.469> outside<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.640> body

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
spiral literally both outside your body

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.090 
spiral literally both outside your body
in<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.119> field<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.749> every<00:02:01.320> single<00:02:01.799> point
