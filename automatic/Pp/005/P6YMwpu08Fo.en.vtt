00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:14.480
 Drunk explains to me why we are 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.309
 playing one against one against me that I am 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.530
 I have to say it because although it is 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.130
 the host has a connection shit and 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.619
 It's better than my 4 clandestine megs 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.420
 any flipas we are already playing 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.420
 against the joker every 24 to see what 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.830
 host for the moment 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.830
 my mother, what a shame 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.570
 because there is not how we have been 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.040
 other items and the other items 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.910
 wanting to be beaten for that says oscar me and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.820
 record it that I paid 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.460
 This must be said has won 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 sticks actually traveled daily so is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 a little more balanced 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.200
 but even that we will not see that from 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.200
 balanced 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.830
 take a side I'm going to put up 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.790
 videos so that this system that the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.790
 flowers a stick 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.390
 by name 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.730
 Y 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.730
 as huelva 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.950
 fuck uncle 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.110
 7 shot and arrives about 8 seconds 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.050
 then bring four jail sticks 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.650
 but when he took 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.650
 low 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.560
 I do not say there are in those to win because 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.670
 you have the empty box, not if I was 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.099

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.880
 the reason 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.880
 the reason is that he put his life 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 and 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.989
 but what yards 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.600
 and is that we go something there fails the shot I 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.600
