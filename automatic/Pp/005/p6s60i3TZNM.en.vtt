00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.779
 now youtube the here we are in another 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.779
 new video and good as 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.410
 as you see here I have a house if it is at 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.780
 side of the mechanism this I have done 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.110
 now for a while 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 and well I wanted to show you an entry 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.769
 totally secret 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.940
 yes yes totally secret also without 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.770
 buttons nothing like that 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.530
 well for what you see here we have a 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.630
 room here we have a room help 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.360
 I have nazarÃ­ 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.030
 the truth is curious action 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.920
 now I'm going to stop on top of this block 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.490
 I'm going to give the second click button to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.490
 right button 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 but today 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.989
 move everything under the floor 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.730
 it's a bit like that quite strange is very 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.110
 ok the mechanism to hide things 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
 because it's a button 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.680
 but 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.930
 and here there are many times I tried 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.090
 put water or something in plan drought but 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.740
 but as you can not approximate 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.729
 emotion to all the water excess cough 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.729
 good many 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.310
 you will wonder how is the theme of 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 organism this 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's pretty strange now practical 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.299
 they will be awake 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.299
 here we have an acceptance 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.420
 a repeater 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.250
 and here we have a reverse 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.270
 as you see good 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.000
 as to see how I say it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.039
 the earth when this with this session 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.289
 more has a block is not a block 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.719
 normal as everyone is not you put on 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.450
 low sectors and this here yes it is 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.770
 repeated now here they make contact but 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.770
 you for example when you plant safe 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.710
 according to the effect about one thousandth 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.439
 of seconds how do you cut if this is your 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.959
 would cut it and know what 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.780
 what it does is put on and take off 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:15.880
 well I did not know about here getting to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.880
 here this would be this way 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.260
 We will need the following materials 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.599
 the torch a hoe to be able to open it 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.599
 it's so sticky this I'm christ 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.270
 and people are obviously 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.430
 good to start we will make a copy 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.420
 a gap here we also need 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.420
 or whatever 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.770
 we do not put good training to start 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.340
 we put 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.340
 one 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.920
 dad 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.550
 and here good we will put another block 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.550
 over on that we will put this 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.170
 we will put 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.170
 any good what is it 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.940
 live the two cakes for agrarian 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.410
 agents would generate a reverse 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.410
 we will put this here and here 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.350
 until here is not that it is not here what 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.080
 we will put to 4 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.460
 a garden 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.460
 we will lower the blocks 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.270
 here 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.460
 achieve agreement 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.930
 what to do 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.930
 do not 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.760
 and justly 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.990
 What I do is give 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.000
 but 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.310
 It's done 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.970
 you want to do it higher or something like 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.270
 what is there then well we are 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.300
 I'm wrong 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.250
 there is no cause 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.250
 more than doing this I recommend 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 but 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.100
 well here we hope to count on what 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.140
 to tell 12 what is like that 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.410
 we put over the limits as if 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.830
 outside a wall a wall but we want to give 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.830
 the fifth 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.250
 Market Stall 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.510
 speak 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.510
 we can not do it here 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.740
 we are already in 2 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.380
 and then let's go here you can improvise a 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.350
 simple door to go out whatever 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.940
 with pistons 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.420
 the truth that is very good lesson 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.080
 method 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.980
 since you can have constructs 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.980
 Saved realities 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.639
 in the cave or something with diamond chests 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.710
 Whatever 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.729
 and good 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.400
 and finished tutorial 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.990
 I hope you liked it like 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.230
 subscribe 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.040
 See you in the next video 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.040
 until next time
