might be good for any painted black
shell<00:01:09.100> turtle<00:01:09.390> there's<00:01:10.390> at<00:01:10.509> least<00:01:10.539> this<00:01:11.850> we

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
shell turtle there's at least this we

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.120 
shell turtle there's at least this we
caught<00:01:13.119> two<00:01:13.420> species<00:01:13.720> of<00:01:14.020> turtles<00:01:14.409> today<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
caught two species of turtles today the

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.609 
caught two species of turtles today the
painted<00:01:15.729> turtle<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.390> western<00:01:17.200> spiny

softshell<00:01:17.950> turtle<00:01:18.670> both<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.210> these<00:01:19.360> are

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
softshell turtle both of these are

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.980 
softshell turtle both of these are
native<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.619> Wyoming<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.490> they<00:01:22.149> are<00:01:22.390> commonly

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
native to Wyoming and they are commonly

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.080 
native to Wyoming and they are commonly
found<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.710> area<00:01:24.009> so<00:01:24.429> we<00:01:24.610> thought<00:01:24.819> they

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
found in this area so we thought they

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.430 
found in this area so we thought they
would<00:01:25.330> be<00:01:25.360> here<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:28.270> are<00:01:28.390> interested<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:29.140> where

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
would be here we are interested in where

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.559 
would be here we are interested in where
the<00:01:30.280> turtles<00:01:30.520> are<00:01:30.789> distributed<00:01:31.299> across

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
the turtles are distributed across

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.080 
the turtles are distributed across
Wyoming<00:01:32.319> most<00:01:32.950> Turtles<00:01:33.399> and<00:01:33.520> Wyoming<00:01:33.880> only

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
Wyoming most Turtles and Wyoming only

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.359 
Wyoming most Turtles and Wyoming only
live<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.390> eastern<00:01:34.840> half<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.289> state<00:01:35.409> but<00:01:36.250> we

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
live in eastern half of the state but we

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.789 
live in eastern half of the state but we
don't<00:01:36.580> have<00:01:36.640> exact<00:01:37.479> locations<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:38.590> many

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
don't have exact locations for many

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.270 
don't have exact locations for many
species

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 

we<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.299> they're<00:01:45.659> already<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
we do know that they're already in this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
we do know that they're already in this
area<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> demonstration

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
area so this was more of a demonstration

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.080 
area so this was more of a demonstration
today<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.320> might<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.890> doing<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> marker

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
today but we might be doing a marker

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
today but we might be doing a marker

idea<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.380> release<00:02:45.680> pet<00:02:45.980> turtles<00:02:46.370> into<00:02:46.550> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
idea to release pet turtles into the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.330 
idea to release pet turtles into the
wild<00:02:47.120> during<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.570> class<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.170> everyone<00:02:49.070> was

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
wild during the class and everyone was

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.680 
wild during the class and everyone was
really<00:02:49.520> interested<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.300> think<00:02:50.450> they

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
really interested in that I think they

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.270 
really interested in that I think they
took<00:02:50.870> home<00:02:51.140> quite<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.770> bit<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.040> information

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
took home quite a bit of information

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.120

they can pass on they just have

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.340 
they can pass on they just have
different<00:02:55.160> spotting<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.240> think<00:02:56.840> most<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
different spotting I think most of the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.080 
different spotting I think most of the
community<00:02:57.770> doesn't<00:02:58.160> ever<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.640> chance<00:02:58.700> to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
community doesn't ever get a chance to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.840 
community doesn't ever get a chance to
do<00:02:59.330> anything<00:02:59.540> like<00:02:59.840> this<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.800> this<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.490> really

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
do anything like this so this is really

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.120 
do anything like this so this is really
exciting<00:03:02.060> for<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.110> get<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.410> see<00:03:03.650> what<00:03:04.100> our

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
exciting for them to get to see what our

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.410 
exciting for them to get to see what our
job<00:03:04.520> is<00:03:04.580> what<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.420> on<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> daily<00:03:05.840> basis
