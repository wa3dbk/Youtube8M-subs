00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.799
 in general itself from the people passing by is it necessary 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.799
 like almost past any other 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 rival 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 maybe an internal shiver you are here 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.330
 and also he gives absolute equality 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 The first submission 3d will consider him already 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.960
 does not pass 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.080
 This chip first happened in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.970
 match 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.850
 wins such a ball 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.400
 after that nadal adapt himself 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.890
 settled down and tried to cut right there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.980
 you thought 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.630
 sorry to throw your 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.970
 twisted kick 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.300
 by going this way on the attack and very 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.220
 an uncomfortable opponent's situation having driven 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.990
 win is purely very expensive 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.350
 great John the restaurant is now 76 he 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350
 in front 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.750
 not mistaken 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.210
 really want to play deep and was in it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.680
 my intention is right in my opinion two 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 times in a row never let him go 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.300
 the game where he had superiority 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.480
 deny whether benefits should be possible only 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.480
 deep hitting hit in the back whether 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.520
 on 7 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.920
 No, I can not earn yet the first 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.200
 set bol on your feed john yes remember 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.590
 that he had two 7 calculations 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.590
 65 1540 and one more 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.460
 in the previous draw but now 2 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.460
 Balaur even though both at the reception 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:09.300
 and the frenzy is absolutely knocking out 88 136 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.870
 miles an hour for 140 served in this tournament 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.440
 Esther 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.560
 in my opinion for the final match 136 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.560
 this is the most impressive indicator 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.720
 how softened from the sacks softened his 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.390
 the second blow such he flew reverse 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.610
 cross from haftor then where did they go I 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.950
 decided to play cat and mouse suffered 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.810
 here look gave here so reverse 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.799
 cross not play he hoped that kick 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.799
 lines will be over 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.540
 unexpected for 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.629
 it turned out the opposite on the racket well and 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.920
 Of course it should be shot if load 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.920
 first set in feed 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.210
 you all will lose this set soon 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.310
 there was a feeling in what on childhood that 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.310
