00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
you're gonna play the octave ease then

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.289 
you're gonna play the octave ease then
play<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.709> again<00:02:29.790> now<00:02:30.790> you're<00:02:30.880> gonna<00:02:31.000> play<00:02:31.150> an

octave<00:02:31.450> E<00:02:31.870> flat<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.760> fly<00:02:33.940> here<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.690> flat

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
octave E flat you fly here and you flat

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.740 
octave E flat you fly here and you flat
there<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:36.370> jump<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.910> top<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.060> it'll

there then jump to the top and it'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.970 
there then jump to the top and it'll
make<00:02:40.870> more<00:02:41.079> sense<00:02:41.230> when<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:41.470> put<00:02:41.650> both<00:02:41.769> hands

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
make more sense when we put both hands

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
make more sense when we put both hands
to<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.250> all<00:02:42.340> right<00:02:42.430> putting<00:02:42.640> both<00:02:42.790> hands

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
to get all right putting both hands

00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:02.750 
to get all right putting both hands
together<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.660> pretty<00:02:43.930> straight<00:02:44.140> forward

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.830 

from<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> top

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.230 

and<00:03:11.840> there<00:03:11.960> you<00:03:12.080> have<00:03:12.140> it
