00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.220
 it 's all this but today 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 I told you about a mini in simple 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.769
 I just love it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.240
 is called the go of home jbl she is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.240
 perfect and in addition it is not expensive 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.040
 so here is this little jbl speaker 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.330
 I am completely fan of it 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.230
 discovery if the tribes is milan 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.270
 he made me discover 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 she is very compact so her room a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.920
 rather banal design for a small 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 pregnant it's cubic it's simple you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 have volume buttons on top 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.840
 so are clickable 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.910
 you said cable what so some 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.890
 like what they cable the button for 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.269
 sponsor with the sweet taste the button 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.100
 ignition as well as the button for 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.090
 pick up and hang up with your 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.739
 phone because she's boarding a 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.360
 micro so you can directly 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.770
 hang up hang up with this speaker 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.239
 it also imports a jack 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.710
 allowing you if you do not have 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.969
 all of you on your device is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.559
 good for connecting your 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.210
 peripherals to this speaker 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 directly it is rather nice level 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.300
 autonomy it lasts five hours I 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.129
 used all friday night in bare skin 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 evening it's going really well 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.180
 it was perfect she held me all the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.890
 evening it was cool also the sound 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 it's fine there are a lot of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.330
 balls in the treble neck not a lot of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 final gong medium that fits a little 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 to his blues and that one listens or that kind 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.850
 life of rap and other one is satisfied 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.470
 today of the quality we have this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 is not a speaker is huge 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.250
 huge so we're happy with the sound he 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 ya with this little trick he's really 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.670
 very correct frankly I am 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.330
 completely fan of this its this is what 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 prove I feel a little lonely a I 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.750
 still not found the missing piece 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.400
 of the puzzle one year protection of course 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
 in a captured video of the sound with a 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.280
 pregnant like that it's complicated but 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.510
