make that kind of bold gamble in the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.840 
make that kind of bold gamble in the
energy<00:01:32.689> area<00:01:33.289> or<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.530> health<00:01:33.740> care<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.700> see

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
energy area or the health care and I see

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.419 
energy area or the health care and I see
Obama<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.450> being<00:01:35.689> able<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.380> do<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:37.189> he's

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
Obama is being able to do that is he's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.060 
Obama is being able to do that is he's
not<00:01:37.610> burdened<00:01:38.149> with<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.299> past<00:01:38.689> I<00:01:39.079> think<00:01:39.860> it's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
not burdened with the past I think it's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.029 
not burdened with the past I think it's
important<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:42.189> understand<00:01:43.189> other<00:01:43.340> people<00:01:43.759> and

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
important to understand other people and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.340 
important to understand other people and
accept<00:01:46.039> even<00:01:46.759> we<00:01:47.390> don't<00:01:47.569> have<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.869> like<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.110> but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
accept even we don't have to like it but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.919 
accept even we don't have to like it but
we<00:01:48.649> need<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.979> accept<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.030> can<00:01:50.240> learn<00:01:50.509> to

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
we need to accept so we can learn to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.359 
we need to accept so we can learn to
live<00:01:51.759> together<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:54.130> harmony<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.780> support<00:01:56.780> Obama

live together in harmony I support Obama

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.109 
live together in harmony I support Obama
that's<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.580> way<00:01:58.759> we<00:01:58.970> can<00:01:59.240> also<00:01:59.450> accept

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
that's the way we can also accept

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.359 
that's the way we can also accept
diversity<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.259> think<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.709> important

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
diversity that I think is important

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.749 
diversity that I think is important
