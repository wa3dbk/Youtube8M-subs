Christmas tree since all these sounds

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.210 
Christmas tree since all these sounds
were<00:00:27.630> created<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.170> samples<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> snow

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
were created with samples from the snow

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.470 
were created with samples from the snow
globe<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.640> saw<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> beginning<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
globe you saw in the beginning in the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.970 
globe you saw in the beginning in the
video<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.650> three<00:00:31.830> different

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
video and there are three different

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.590 
video and there are three different
instruments<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.669> come<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> pack<00:00:33.239> here

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
instruments that come in the pack here

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200 
instruments that come in the pack here
so<00:00:34.110> let's<00:00:34.739> start<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.520> because

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so let's start the first one because

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
so let's start the first one because
it's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> most<00:00:36.690> true<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.680> actual

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it's the most true to the actual

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.080 
it's the most true to the actual
instrument<00:00:38.700> itself<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.170> called<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
instrument itself this is called the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
instrument itself this is called the
draw<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> ground<00:00:42.420> Christmas<00:00:42.809> tree<00:00:42.989> since<00:00:45.980> so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
draw the ground Christmas tree since so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
draw the ground Christmas tree since so
it<00:00:47.190> sounds<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.670> music<00:00:48.059> box<00:00:48.090> I'm<00:00:48.600> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it sounds like a music box I'm just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.040 
it sounds like a music box I'm just
switching<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> octaves<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.780> seen<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
switching the octaves you seen get a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
switching the octaves you seen get a
little<00:00:52.320> taste<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.920> sounds<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> here

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
little taste of what it sounds like here

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
little taste of what it sounds like here
um<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.260> open<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> sampler

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
um as we open it up you see the sampler

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
um as we open it up you see the sampler
and<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> shelter<00:01:00.020> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> morph

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and we have a shelter this is the morph

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.030 
and we have a shelter this is the morph
filter<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:03.379> have<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.619> fun<00:01:04.830> playing

filter so you can have some fun playing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
filter so you can have some fun playing
around<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.119> turn<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
around with that you can turn off the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.940 
around with that you can turn off the
LFO<00:01:07.140> song<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.909> hear<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> moving<00:01:12.950> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
LFO song you can hear that moving this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.810 
LFO song you can hear that moving this
modulation<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.659> moving<00:01:16.200> our<00:01:17.009> filter<00:01:17.610> bed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
modulation here is moving our filter bed

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
modulation here is moving our filter bed
and<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.900> course<00:01:19.170> changes<00:01:19.619> depending<00:01:20.009> on

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and this of course changes depending on

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.210 
and this of course changes depending on
why<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> wharf<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.860> that's<00:01:25.860> kind

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
why the wharf is so you know that's kind

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
why the wharf is so you know that's kind
of<00:01:26.250> nice<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.000> gonna<00:01:27.150> turn<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> way

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of nice I'm gonna turn that all the way

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520 
of nice I'm gonna turn that all the way
up<00:01:27.869> I've<00:01:28.229> made<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.780> FM<00:01:30.780> oscillator

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
up I've made use of the FM oscillator

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940 
up I've made use of the FM oscillator
here<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> turn<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> volume<00:01:33.950> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
here so as you turn up the volume you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.390 
here so as you turn up the volume you're
playing<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.670> these<00:01:35.909> controls<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:37.400> adding

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
playing with these controls here adding

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.230 
playing with these controls here adding
some<00:01:38.900> harmonics<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.970> changing<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> overall

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
some harmonics to changing the overall

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.490 
some harmonics to changing the overall
sound

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.550 

you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:47.940> quite<00:01:48.240> some

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
you know you can get quite some

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.350 
you know you can get quite some
interesting<00:01:49.560> results<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
interesting results from that and the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.540 
interesting results from that and the
final<00:01:51.750> part<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.170> synth<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.040> stereo

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
final part of this synth is this stereo

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.630 
final part of this synth is this stereo
be<00:01:53.880> repeat<00:01:54.240> track<00:01:54.740> rack<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.070> made<00:01:56.310> here

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
be repeat track rack that I made here

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.050 
be repeat track rack that I made here
which<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.600> has<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.440> chains<00:01:58.740> let's<00:01:59.729> beat

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
which is the has two chains let's beat

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.030 
which is the has two chains let's beat
repeats<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.600> each<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.560> panned<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
repeats on each one but they panned the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.290 
repeats on each one but they panned the
left<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.990> knob<00:02:04.229> turns<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.400> the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
left and right and the knob turns on the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.080 
left and right and the knob turns on the
rack<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.560> adjusts<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> grid<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:08.910> each

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
rack and then adjusts the grid for each

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.790 
rack and then adjusts the grid for each
one<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.570> so<00:02:09.869> let's<00:02:09.899> hear<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.649> this

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
one of these so let's hear what this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
one of these so let's hear what this
sounds<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.690> it's<00:02:12.690> gonna<00:02:12.959> give<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.380> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
sounds like it's gonna give you like a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:26.479 
sounds like it's gonna give you like a
nice<00:02:13.650> glitchy<00:02:14.100> thing<00:02:14.459> gone<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.709> if<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> have

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
nice glitchy thing gone and if you have

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.770 
nice glitchy thing gone and if you have
headphones<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.239> can<00:02:27.390> hear<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.660> these

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
headphones on you can hear that these

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.750 
headphones on you can hear that these
are<00:02:27.959> bouncing<00:02:28.440> around<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.890> each<00:02:29.040> side<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.610> it's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
are bouncing around on each side so it's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
are bouncing around on each side so it's
a<00:02:29.820> pretty<00:02:30.000> fun<00:02:30.330> effect<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.290> basic

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
a pretty fun effect so that's the basic

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.930 
a pretty fun effect so that's the basic
synth

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
synth

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.180 
synth
then<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> variation<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.709> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
then we have a variation of that and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.199 
then we have a variation of that and
this<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.530> simply<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.520> real<00:02:41.700> difference<00:02:42.090> is

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
this one simply the real difference is

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.280 
this one simply the real difference is
that<00:02:42.239> I'm<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.510> looping<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.170> sample<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:45.290> so

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that I'm just looping the sample here so

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.290 
that I'm just looping the sample here so
we're<00:02:46.440> getting<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.709> back<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.820> forth<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
we're getting some back and forth and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.560 
we're getting some back and forth and
looping<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.770> moving<00:02:50.010> from<00:02:50.549> you<00:02:51.450> know

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
looping here it's moving from you know

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.800 
looping here it's moving from you know
forward<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.500> backwards<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.160> can<00:02:53.310> see<00:02:53.519> that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
forward to backwards so you can see that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.420 
forward to backwards so you can see that
little<00:02:54.810> orange<00:02:55.140> line<00:02:55.440> hopefully<00:02:56.130> moving

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
little orange line hopefully moving

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.449 
little orange line hopefully moving
around<00:02:56.670> back<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.239> forth<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.950> again<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> have

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
around back and forth and again I have

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.370 
around back and forth and again I have
this<00:02:59.610> beat<00:02:59.940> repeat<00:03:00.299> thing<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
this beat repeat thing going on in the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.040 
this beat repeat thing going on in the
background

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.970 

you<00:03:09.050> got<00:03:09.320> our<00:03:09.470> definite<00:03:10.130> muscle<00:03:10.670> later<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you got our definite muscle later you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.230 
you got our definite muscle later you
turn<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.340> all<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.550> way<00:03:16.640> up<00:03:16.670> you're<00:03:16.940> playing

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
turn it all the way up you're playing

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.330 
turn it all the way up you're playing
out<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.600> noise<00:03:19.150> long<00:03:20.150> enough<00:03:20.480> an<00:03:20.660> oscillator

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
out the noise long enough an oscillator

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.390 
out the noise long enough an oscillator
which<00:03:22.340> gives<00:03:22.760> us<00:03:22.940> just<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.630> Homer<00:03:24.560> character<00:03:25.070> if

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
which gives us just a Homer character if

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.190 
which gives us just a Homer character if
you<00:03:25.550> get<00:03:25.730> crazy<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.630> basically<00:03:26.810> have

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
you get crazy with it and basically have

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.310 
you get crazy with it and basically have
a<00:03:27.260> noise<00:03:27.560> since<00:03:30.100> you<00:03:31.100> can<00:03:31.250> keep<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.550> real<00:03:31.730> so

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
a noise since you can keep it real so

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.130 
a noise since you can keep it real so
dirtying<00:03:33.320> up<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.590> little<00:03:33.800> bit<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:35.810> part<00:03:36.050> of

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
dirtying up a little bit it's part of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.650 
dirtying up a little bit it's part of
what<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.290> like<00:03:36.410> about<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:36.950> particular

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
what I like about this particular

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.400 
what I like about this particular
instrument<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.020> much<00:03:39.200> as<00:03:39.380> if<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:40.460> notice

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
instrument so much as if you notice

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.930 
instrument so much as if you notice
you're<00:03:42.410> kind<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.740> hearing<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.100> noise<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
you're kind of hearing the noise of the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.510 
you're kind of hearing the noise of the
actual<00:03:44.420> snowglobes<00:03:45.170> motor<00:03:45.710> or<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.100> gears

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
actual snowglobes motor or the gears

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.220 
actual snowglobes motor or the gears
turning<00:03:47.020> which<00:03:50.020> especially<00:03:51.020> as<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.200> move

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
turning which especially as you move

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.410 
turning which especially as you move
around<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.770> octaves<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.880> it's

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
around the octaves this and it's

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.860 
around the octaves this and it's
different<00:03:53.780> character<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.590> it

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
different character to it

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.650 
different character to it
you're<00:03:56.870> like<00:03:57.850> what<00:03:58.850> kinds<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.210> interesting

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
you're like what kinds of interesting

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.920 
you're like what kinds of interesting
shuffling<00:04:00.380> noises<00:04:00.880> down<00:04:01.880> here<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.450> as<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.660> get

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
shuffling noises down here and as I get

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.600 
shuffling noises down here and as I get
real<00:04:03.110> high<00:04:05.170> sounds<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.230> little<00:04:06.320> different<00:04:08.350> so

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
real high sounds a little different so

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.030 
real high sounds a little different so
very<00:04:10.810> get<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.840> lot<00:04:11.990> my<00:04:12.080> character<00:04:12.590> I'd<00:04:12.770> say

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
very get a lot my character I'd say

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.100 
very get a lot my character I'd say
which<00:04:14.000> is<00:04:14.030> cool<00:04:14.480> which<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.810> what<00:04:14.960> we're<00:04:15.080> going

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
which is cool which is what we're going

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.060 
which is cool which is what we're going
for<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.520> last<00:04:16.760> one<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.180> grain<00:04:17.510> synth

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
for and the last one is a grain synth

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.240 
for and the last one is a grain synth
sort<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.280> grain<00:04:19.489> sing<00:04:20.980> basically<00:04:21.980> I'm<00:04:22.070> using

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
sort of a grain sing basically I'm using

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.100 
sort of a grain sing basically I'm using
the<00:04:22.490> simple<00:04:22.910> here<00:04:23.090> because<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> simple<00:04:23.870> R<00:04:23.960> has

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
the simple here because the simple R has

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.410 
the simple here because the simple R has
control<00:04:24.470> over<00:04:24.500> all<00:04:24.890> of<00:04:24.920> these<00:04:25.280> parameters<00:04:25.760> for

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
control over all of these parameters for

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.080 
control over all of these parameters for
the<00:04:26.510> loop<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:28.100> right<00:04:28.250> now<00:04:28.400> we're<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.670> looping

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the loop so right now we're just looping

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.510 
the loop so right now we're just looping
the<00:04:29.180> whole<00:04:29.360> thing<00:04:29.600> back<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.080> forth<00:04:30.140> now<00:04:31.070> as<00:04:31.340> I

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
the whole thing back and forth now as I

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.480 
the whole thing back and forth now as I
move<00:04:31.760> this<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:33.170> start<00:04:33.410> changing<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.920> sound

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.800 

I'm<00:04:37.490> moving<00:04:38.000> more<00:04:38.210> load<00:04:38.740> sample<00:04:39.740> begins<00:04:40.100> from

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
I'm moving more load sample begins from

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.690 
I'm moving more load sample begins from
the<00:04:41.810> loop<00:04:42.290> start<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.980> where<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.460> loops<00:04:45.700> starts

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
the loop start is where the loops starts

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.310 
the loop start is where the loops starts
happening<00:04:46.880> in<00:04:47.210> relation<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.930> sample

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
happening in relation to the sample

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.120 
happening in relation to the sample
start<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.300> 100%<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:51.170> starts<00:04:51.500> right<00:04:51.800> with<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
start so 100% it starts right with the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.200 
start so 100% it starts right with the
sample<00:04:52.960> start<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.170> we're<00:04:55.040> basically

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
sample start and we're basically

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.520 
sample start and we're basically
pinching<00:04:56.210> the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
pinching the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.080 
pinching the
sample<00:04:58.530> down<00:04:58.680> by<00:04:59.009> moving<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.759> I<00:04:59.789> can<00:05:00.000> do

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
sample down by moving this and I can do

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.369 
sample down by moving this and I can do
the<00:05:00.180> same<00:05:00.389> thing<00:05:00.599> on<00:05:00.659> the<00:05:00.780> other<00:05:00.810> end<00:05:01.080> with<00:05:01.259> the

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
the same thing on the other end with the

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:07.670 
the same thing on the other end with the
loop<00:05:01.560> end<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:06.690> reason<00:05:07.080> I'm<00:05:07.199> calling<00:05:07.590> it

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
loop end and the reason I'm calling it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.890 
loop end and the reason I'm calling it
the<00:05:07.949> grain<00:05:08.310> scent<00:05:08.759> is<00:05:08.940> because<00:05:09.210> then<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.539> said

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
the grain scent is because then you said

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.619 
the grain scent is because then you said
that<00:05:10.830> musical<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.550> other<00:05:11.879> things<00:05:12.240> the

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
that musical and other things the

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:19.879 
that musical and other things the
Maalouf<00:05:13.259> is<00:05:13.500> best<00:05:13.830> closer<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.789> closer<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.710> I

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
Maalouf is best closer and closer and I

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.580 
Maalouf is best closer and closer and I
 giving<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.580> control<00:05:20.729> of<00:05:20.909> attack
