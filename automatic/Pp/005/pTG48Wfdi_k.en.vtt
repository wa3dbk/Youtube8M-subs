00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
armatures for the tamashii stage I think

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
armatures for the tamashii stage I think
the<00:02:12.690> effect<00:02:12.960> looks<00:02:13.170> alright<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> hope<00:02:13.980> the

the effect looks alright but I hope the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.560 
the effect looks alright but I hope the
single<00:02:14.430> peg<00:02:14.610> connection<00:02:15.030> does<00:02:15.150> not<00:02:15.180> lead<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
single peg connection does not lead to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.460 
single peg connection does not lead to
