00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
girls in the world that like I wouldn't

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
girls in the world that like I wouldn't
have<00:01:16.409> wanted<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.280> as<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:18.030> girl

and so I thought it'd be cool to just
write<00:01:20.009> better<00:01:20.670> stuff<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.150> women<00:01:21.420> and

write better stuff for women and

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.690 
have sort of suffered through tragedy
together<00:03:06.569> heal<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.680> another<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.459> lot<00:03:08.670> of

together heal one another it's a lot of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.360 
together heal one another it's a lot of
like<00:03:08.970> macro<00:03:09.599> micro<00:03:09.930> thinking<00:03:10.650> which<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:10.889> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
like macro micro thinking which is and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.640 
like macro micro thinking which is and
it<00:03:11.549> was<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.819> was<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.939> nice<00:03:12.150> balance<00:03:12.329> because<00:03:12.840> you

I<00:03:33.389> give<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.409> Mike<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:35.760> directing

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
I give so much to Mike in the directing

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.289 
I give so much to Mike in the directing
and<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.989> his<00:03:37.199> vision<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:37.980> because<00:03:38.430> you

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and in his vision of it because you

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.719 
and in his vision of it because you
could<00:03:39.480> easily<00:03:39.720> topple<00:03:40.500> over<00:03:40.799> into<00:03:41.250> making<00:03:41.489> a

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
could easily topple over into making a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.270 
could easily topple over into making a
film<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.269> just<00:03:42.599> seems<00:03:42.870> not<00:03:43.229> real<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.069> sort

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
film that just seems not real and sort

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.599 
film that just seems not real and sort
of<00:03:44.340> silly<00:03:44.699> and<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:46.019> think<00:03:46.949> it<00:03:47.069> for<00:03:47.280> him<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.489> was

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
of silly and I think it for him it was

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.460 
of silly and I think it for him it was
really<00:03:47.940> important<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.780> way<00:03:48.870> he<00:03:49.049> shot<00:03:49.290> it

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
really important in the way he shot it

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.809 
really important in the way he shot it
and<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.709> way<00:03:49.799> he<00:03:49.919> edited<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.370> all<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.729> the

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and the way he edited in all of the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.420 
and the way he edited in all of the
construction<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.750> colors<00:03:52.470> everything<00:03:53.250> for

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
construction the colors everything for

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.879 
construction the colors everything for
it<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.669> feel<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.510> real<00:03:54.810> story<00:03:55.229> but<00:03:55.709> this

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it to feel like a real story but this

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.800 
it to feel like a real story but this
thing<00:03:56.129> was<00:03:56.280> happening<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.760> real<00:03:57.000> people<00:03:57.239> so

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
thing was happening to real people so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.740 
thing was happening to real people so
much<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:59.760> has<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.299> would<00:04:00.419> almost<00:04:00.540> feel

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
much so that it has it would almost feel

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420 
much so that it has it would almost feel
like<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.949> know<00:04:02.040> we're<00:04:02.280> watching

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
like what if you you know we're watching

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.729 
like what if you you know we're watching
someone's<00:04:03.060> home<00:04:03.269> video<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.560> just

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
someone's home video and you just

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.219 
someone's home video and you just
captured<00:04:05.250> another<00:04:05.669> planet<00:04:06.449> in<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.659> sky<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
captured another planet in the sky and

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.259 
captured another planet in the sky and
that<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.889> kind<00:04:08.129> of<00:04:08.280> realism<00:04:08.519> would<00:04:08.790> make<00:04:09.060> you

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
that that kind of realism would make you

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.580 
that that kind of realism would make you
believe<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:12.239> yeah<00:04:12.659> I<00:04:12.959> think<00:04:13.109> he<00:04:13.290> did<00:04:13.470> that

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
believe and so yeah I think he did that

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.159 
believe and so yeah I think he did that
very<00:04:13.650> well<00:04:13.919> now<00:04:14.579> having<00:04:15.150> been<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.599> involved<00:04:15.780> in

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
very well now having been so involved in

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.960 
very well now having been so involved in
this<00:04:16.260> picture<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.949> such<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.519> collaborative

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
this picture and such a collaborative

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.729 
this picture and such a collaborative
effort<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> be<00:04:18.900> difficult<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.440> go

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
effort is it going to be difficult to go

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.620 
effort is it going to be difficult to go
into<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:19.979> movie<00:04:20.159> where<00:04:20.459> you're<00:04:20.609> just<00:04:20.940> acting<00:04:21.180> or

writing is amazing and I've spent a lot
of<00:04:35.050> time<00:04:35.290> trying<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.100> figure<00:04:36.250> out<00:04:36.340> how<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> do

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
of time trying to figure out how to do

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.370 
of time trying to figure out how to do
that<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.180> think<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.480> will<00:04:37.690> always<00:04:37.900> do<00:04:38.230> that

that and I think I will always do that
but<00:04:38.820> even<00:04:39.820> when<00:04:40.120> you're<00:04:40.240> writing<00:04:40.390> with<00:04:40.570> a

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
but even when you're writing with a

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.420 
but even when you're writing with a
collaborator<00:04:41.170> things<00:04:41.830> are<00:04:42.010> coming<00:04:42.340> from

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
collaborator things are coming from

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.980 
collaborator things are coming from
you're<00:04:42.640> sort<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:42.970> shared<00:04:43.240> point<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.600> view<00:04:43.780> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you're sort of shared point of view and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.630 
you're sort of shared point of view and
that<00:04:44.020> point<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.380> view<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.620> so<00:04:44.680> limited<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.490> mean

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
that point of view is so limited I mean

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.240 
that point of view is so limited I mean
like<00:04:45.850> I'm<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.720> girl<00:04:46.990> who<00:04:47.380> was<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.650> born<00:04:48.130> in

America<00:04:48.700> who's<00:04:49.060> in<00:04:49.330> her<00:04:49.420> 20s<00:04:49.780> who<00:04:50.020> has<00:04:50.740> had<00:04:50.890> a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
America who's in her 20s who has had a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.470 
America who's in her 20s who has had a
certain<00:04:51.190> set<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.310> experiences<00:04:51.700> you<00:04:52.030> see<00:04:52.270> the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
certain set of experiences you see the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.170 
certain set of experiences you see the
world<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:53.080> certain<00:04:53.290> way<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.550> thing<00:04:54.790> that's

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
world a certain way and the thing that's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.050 
world a certain way and the thing that's
so<00:04:55.780> intoxicating<00:04:56.680> about<00:04:57.070> being<00:04:57.340> an<00:04:57.430> actor<00:04:57.820> is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
so intoxicating about being an actor is

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.660 
so intoxicating about being an actor is
that<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.390> get<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.810> lose<00:04:59.590> yourself<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.220> someone

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
that you get to lose yourself in someone

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.180 
that you get to lose yourself in someone
else's<00:05:00.840> point<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> view<00:05:02.020> their<00:05:02.620> way<00:05:02.800> of<00:05:02.950> seeing

else's point of view their way of seeing
things<00:05:03.490> in<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.970> story<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.990> never<00:05:05.230> would

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
things in a story that you never would

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.300 
things in a story that you never would
have<00:05:05.620> conceived<00:05:06.100> of<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.550> become<00:05:07.120> that<00:05:07.660> person

you know travel somewhere with someone
that<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.680> real<00:05:15.070> thrill<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.460> think<00:05:15.790> of<00:05:15.910> being

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
that is the real thrill I think of being
