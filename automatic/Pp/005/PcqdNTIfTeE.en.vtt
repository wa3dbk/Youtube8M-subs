the reason that they have to add a patch

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.550 
the reason that they have to add a patch
is<00:03:34.920> they<00:03:35.040> probably<00:03:35.310> had<00:03:35.750> full<00:03:36.750> intentions<00:03:37.380> on

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
is they probably had full intentions on

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.740 
is they probably had full intentions on
making<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.610> go<00:03:38.820> out<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.120> buy<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.270> new<00:03:39.390> headset

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
making you go out and buy a new headset

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.410 
making you go out and buy a new headset
for<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> ps4<00:03:40.520> because<00:03:41.520> they<00:03:41.850> were<00:03:42.120> probably

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
for the ps4 because they were probably

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.000 
for the ps4 because they were probably
looking<00:03:42.660> at<00:03:42.900> Microsoft<00:03:43.470> hey<00:03:43.680> if<00:03:43.800> Microsoft
