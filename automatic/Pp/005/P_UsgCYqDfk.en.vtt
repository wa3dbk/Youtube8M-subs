00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
next section will cover a few of the

next section will cover a few of the
main<00:00:18.570> points<00:00:19.020> I've<00:00:19.380> created<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.550> character<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
main points I've created a character and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.450 
main points I've created a character and
Max<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.570> several<00:00:21.930> different<00:00:22.230> behaviors<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
Max with several different behaviors the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.859 
Max with several different behaviors the
most<00:00:23.670> important<00:00:24.119> thing<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.300> know<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
most important thing to know is that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.140 
most important thing to know is that
creator<00:00:25.320> does<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.740> support<00:00:26.130> blending<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
creator does not support blending so

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.910 
creator does not support blending so
each<00:00:27.330> behavior<00:00:27.869> must<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.230> complete<00:00:28.680> before

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
each behavior must be complete before

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.279 
each behavior must be complete before
exporting<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.789> all<00:00:30.179> behaviors<00:00:30.689> must<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
exporting and all behaviors must be in a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.020 
exporting and all behaviors must be in a
single<00:00:31.650> file

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.240 

another<00:00:34.899> thing<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.230> consider<00:00:35.379> is<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:35.829> frames

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
another thing to consider is that frames

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.279 
another thing to consider is that frames
and<00:00:36.489> Max<00:00:36.699> become<00:00:37.149> fractions<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.750> seconds<00:00:38.140> in

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
and Max become fractions of seconds in

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.139 
and Max become fractions of seconds in
real<00:00:38.469> time<00:00:38.680> where<00:00:38.949> frame<00:00:39.219> rate<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.579> constantly

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
real time where frame rate is constantly

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.500 
real time where frame rate is constantly
varying<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:41.769> this<00:00:41.949> end<00:00:42.309> it<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> good<00:00:43.030> idea<00:00:43.360> to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
varying to this end it is a good idea to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.660 
varying to this end it is a good idea to
set<00:00:43.719> frame<00:00:43.960> rate<00:00:44.170> in<00:00:44.350> max<00:00:44.589> to<00:00:44.829> 25<00:00:45.250> frames<00:00:45.519> per

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
set frame rate in max to 25 frames per

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.180 
set frame rate in max to 25 frames per
second<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.300> set<00:00:46.960> keys<00:00:47.199> only<00:00:47.620> every<00:00:47.920> fifth

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
second and set keys only every fifth

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.090 
second and set keys only every fifth
frame<00:00:48.430> whenever<00:00:48.789> possible

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 

I've<00:00:56.640> made<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> list<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.359> stop<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.660> start<00:00:58.050> times

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I've made a list of stop and start times

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
I've made a list of stop and start times
of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> behaviors<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.519> character<00:00:59.760> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of the behaviors for this character for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.229

this time when i import i need to set

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.260 
this time when i import i need to set
animation<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.710> yes<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.790> i<00:01:19.060> needed

more than every fifth frame i'll set the

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
and creator phones will not move the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.300 
and creator phones will not move the
mesh<00:01:31.659> so<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.260> need<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.560> group<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.920> mesh<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
mesh so I need to group the mesh in the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.630 
mesh so I need to group the mesh in the
bone<00:01:33.549> hierarchy<00:01:34.150> together

now<00:01:36.330> I'm<00:01:36.479> ready<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> drop<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.229> key<00:01:37.440> move

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
now I'm ready to drop the key move

so I'll turn off the animation for the
regular<00:03:24.150> third<00:03:24.420> person

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210

on the chance that I may want to toggle
between<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.890> two<00:03:43.100> I'll<00:03:43.640> add<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.090> toggle<00:03:44.450> cam

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
between the two I'll add the toggle cam

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.100

you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.050 

now<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> can<00:03:59.020> use<00:03:59.140> my<00:03:59.170> Tiki<00:03:59.830> to<00:04:00.670> switch<00:04:00.910> between

now I can use my Tiki to switch between

another topic to investigate we'll add a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.890 
another topic to investigate we'll add a
short<00:04:12.920> wall<00:04:13.129> object<00:04:13.670> from<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.879> collection

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.870 

the<00:04:19.530> character<00:04:19.919> gets<00:04:20.040> stopped<00:04:20.400> at<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.729> wall

the character gets stopped at the wall

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.670 
the character gets stopped at the wall
or<00:04:21.120> slides<00:04:21.509> along<00:04:21.720> depending<00:04:22.350> on<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> angle

of approach by adding a short sound and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.980 
of approach by adding a short sound and
setting<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.070> to<00:04:26.190> trigger<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.610> collision<00:04:27.120> we

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
setting it to trigger on collision we

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.420 
setting it to trigger on collision we
can<00:04:28.139> see<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.530> hit<00:04:28.830> may<00:04:29.190> trigger

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
can see that the hit may trigger

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.630 
can see that the hit may trigger
multiple<00:04:29.940> times

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.679
