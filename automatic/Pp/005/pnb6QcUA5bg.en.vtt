hi<00:00:00.510> everyone<00:00:00.840> I'm<00:00:01.020> just<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.439> explain

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hi everyone I'm just going to explain

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi everyone I'm just going to explain
briefly<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.340> principle<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.300> using<00:00:03.659> twin<00:00:03.990> D

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
briefly the principle about using twin D

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.630 
briefly the principle about using twin D
eyes<00:00:04.350> now<00:00:04.710> I've<00:00:04.830> got<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> couple<00:00:05.130> videos<00:00:05.430> on

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
eyes now I've got a couple videos on

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.509 
eyes now I've got a couple videos on
this<00:00:06.029> already<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:07.040> recently<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.069> needed<00:00:08.400> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
this already but recently I needed to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.459 
this already but recently I needed to
change<00:00:08.760> me<00:00:09.030> resin<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.510> arrived<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.080> changed

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
change me resin that arrived I changed

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.560 
change me resin that arrived I changed
it<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.860> big<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.330> there

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
it in the big one that you can see there

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.060 
it in the big one that you can see there
that's<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.990> DI<00:00:14.960> I've<00:00:15.960> got<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> small<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.800> there

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that's a DI I've got the small one there

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.029 
that's a DI I've got the small one there
now<00:00:17.480> what<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.510> did<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:18.810> isolate<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.500> both<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
now what I did was isolate them both I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
now what I did was isolate them both I
had<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> water<00:00:20.730> coming<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.390> small<00:00:21.689> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
had the water coming out of a small one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.009 
had the water coming out of a small one
and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.470> tested<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.369> TDS<00:00:23.910> meter<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and I tested it with the TDS meter that

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
and I tested it with the TDS meter that
was<00:00:25.170> coming<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.560> at<00:00:25.710> sixteen<00:00:26.250> whereas<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
was coming out at sixteen whereas the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720 
was coming out at sixteen whereas the
large<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.750> doing<00:00:28.019> nothing<00:00:28.289> at<00:00:28.410> all

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
large one was doing nothing at all

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
large one was doing nothing at all
originally<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.470> large<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> other

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
originally the large one was the other

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.479 
originally the large one was the other
way<00:00:32.880> around<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.809> taking<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> brunt<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
way around that was taking the brunt of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.060 
way around that was taking the brunt of
the<00:00:35.670> fresh<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.450> coming<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:38.040> was

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the fresh water coming in and it was

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090 
the fresh water coming in and it was
going<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> small<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
going into the small one but then the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.770 
going into the small one but then the
TDS<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.469> sixteen<00:00:43.469> seventeen

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
TDS was going up to sixteen seventeen

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.500 
TDS was going up to sixteen seventeen
even<00:00:45.780> with<00:00:45.930> both<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.410> together<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> what

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
even with both of them together so what

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
even with both of them together so what
I've<00:00:48.600> done<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> I've<00:00:49.289> got<00:00:49.469> some<00:00:49.649> new<00:00:49.829> resin

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I've done now is I've got some new resin

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
I've done now is I've got some new resin
that<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.730> delivered<00:00:51.090> yesterday<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
that was delivered yesterday and I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.650 
that was delivered yesterday and I
filled<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.739> large<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> principle

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
filled up a large one now the principle

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
filled up a large one now the principle
is<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:56.699> swap<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.120> around<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> small

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
is you swap them around and the small

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.939 
is you swap them around and the small
one<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.910> taking<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> brunt<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
one is now taking the brunt of the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.000 
one is now taking the brunt of the
impurities<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.910> water<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.739> one

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
impurities in the water and that one

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.300 
impurities in the water and that one
will<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.820> taking<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> tedious<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.380> that's

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
will be taking the tedious down that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.179 
will be taking the tedious down that's
all<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.729> minerals<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> water<00:01:09.479> down<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
all the minerals and the water down to

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.700 
all the minerals and the water down to
16<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> large<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.510> hasn't<00:01:13.350> really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
16 so the large one now hasn't really

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
16 so the large one now hasn't really
got<00:01:13.860> much<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.909> polish

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
got much to do that I'll just polish

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
got much to do that I'll just polish
that<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.720> finish<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> sixteen<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> bring

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that off finish that sixteen and bring

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.920 
that off finish that sixteen and bring
it<00:01:17.700> down<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.140> absolute<00:01:19.140> zero<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.930> what's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it down to absolute zero there so what's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
it down to absolute zero there so what's
gonna<00:01:22.140> happen<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> reason<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gonna happen the reason we do this is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.300 
gonna happen the reason we do this is
because<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> small<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.900> see

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
because the small one there you can see

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
because the small one there you can see
that's<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> old<00:01:29.640> resin<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.509> still<00:01:30.810> bring

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that's the old resin that still bring

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's the old resin that still bring
the<00:01:31.110> water<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.950> 16<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.479> getting

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the water down to 16 which is getting

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.950 
the water down to 16 which is getting
slightly<00:01:34.590> beyond<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.720> property<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.840> she

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
slightly beyond the property if she

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
slightly beyond the property if she
couldn't<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> still<00:01:38.189> use<00:01:38.369> 60<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.909> 69<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
couldn't you can still use 60 up to 69 I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.319 
couldn't you can still use 60 up to 69 I
go<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:39.900> twenty<00:01:40.890> sometimes<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.210> it's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
go up to some twenty sometimes but it's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
go up to some twenty sometimes but it's
getting<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.869> point<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> it's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
getting to the point where it it's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.289 
getting to the point where it it's
getting<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.340> dodgy<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> might<00:01:45.000> start

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
getting a bit dodgy you might start

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
getting a bit dodgy you might start
leaving<00:01:45.570> spots<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> windless<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.649> that's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
leaving spots on a windless so that's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760 
leaving spots on a windless so that's
taken<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.729> brunt<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.450> it'll<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.530> going

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
taken the brunt of it now it'll be going

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.149 
taken the brunt of it now it'll be going
into<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> big<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> resin<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> I've

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
into the big one so the resin that I've

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
into the big one so the resin that I've
just<00:01:53.399> put<00:01:53.640> into<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.630> gonna<00:01:54.750> last<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
just put into there it's gonna last a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.980 
just put into there it's gonna last a
lot<00:01:55.560> longer<00:01:56.180> because<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.719> there

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
lot longer because the little one there

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
lot longer because the little one there
is<00:01:58.860> taking<00:01:59.399> all<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.890> initial<00:02:01.890> efforts<00:02:02.219> now

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
is taking all the initial efforts now

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.609 
is taking all the initial efforts now
all<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> minerals<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> water<00:02:04.259> really

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
all the minerals out the water really

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.950 
all the minerals out the water really
down<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> 16<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.640> least<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.659> instead<00:02:06.899> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
down to 16 at least so instead of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.369 
down to 16 at least so instead of
wasting<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.660> bigger<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:09.989> hasn't<00:02:10.140> got<00:02:10.259> as

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
wasting it the bigger one hasn't got as

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.020 
wasting it the bigger one hasn't got as
much<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> last<00:02:11.700> longer

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
much to do so it's going to last longer

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
much to do so it's going to last longer
they<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.379> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
they don't have to be a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.399 
they don't have to be a
one<00:02:13.860> large<00:02:14.159> one<00:02:14.250> doesn't<00:02:14.670> matter<00:02:15.019> it<00:02:16.019> depends

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
one large one doesn't matter it depends

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.839 
one large one doesn't matter it depends
on<00:02:16.500> whether<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.739> live<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.159> two<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
on whether you live but two of the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.190 
on whether you live but two of the
bigger<00:02:18.030> ones<00:02:18.239> will<00:02:18.360> perhaps<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.720> better<00:02:18.989> but

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
bigger ones will perhaps be better but

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.690 
bigger ones will perhaps be better but
where<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> live<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.819> TDS<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.269> about<00:02:22.610> 6070<00:02:23.610> at

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
where I live the TDS is about 6070 at

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.289 
where I live the TDS is about 6070 at
the<00:02:23.790> tap<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.640> that's<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> job<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.209> be

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the tap so that's the job you can be

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.600 
the tap so that's the job you can be
doing<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.590> fancy<00:02:28.980> doing<00:02:29.190> I<00:02:29.280> haven't<00:02:29.519> done

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
doing if you fancy doing I haven't done

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.470 
doing if you fancy doing I haven't done
that<00:02:29.670> before

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that before

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.810 
that before
it<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:30.900> us<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.319> last<00:02:31.500> longer<00:02:32.810> so
