00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 Hello everyone yesterday was a comment 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.920
 we were asked a question about 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.730
 the car stood in winter 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.420
 36 BMW with a motor 40 and type is not 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.860
 start up 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.770
 Grisha connects shorter 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.759
 gasoline pump only directly business cards we 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.080
 visit ie if there is pressure in the ramp 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.059
 Now this here 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.480
 the motor this business and say well I 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.920
 the motor is different there is n 43 m 42 not 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.449
 it seems just go here a little bit 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.790
 different but practically the same 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:47.500
 motor here is relative to m 30 we then 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.549
 let's say we are the same almost series 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.409
 shorter here is his trump 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.920
 if you eat created pressure that is 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:58.580
 in the entire business system 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 it will not be heard right now like you 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.790
 need to check first 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.220
 if the pressure is basically so here they are 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.210
 because it's better to check everything 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.280
 when the ignition is turned on 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.119
 gasoline pump fits electricity then 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.859
 have a put control and check i 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.520
 turn on the ignition or give to the starter 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:25.880
 powered or not possible what not 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.729
 is powered by relat any 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.590
 type drove you further need 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.460
 check is about to tramp his 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.070
 here here there are two two pipes behind 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.200
 he 1 here is a ram on the opponent of them 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.749
 goes back to feed 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.749
 in theory now I will say 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 in short so which goes pay 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.210
 attention to the fuel filter that's gone 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.620
 which goes up to the ramp then we go 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.960
 innings 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.130
 need to see what pressure is right 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 if it is lower than one, even this is all 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:19.250
 this is the limit, that is, there will not be 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:23.420
 drove bars grants farther what spark 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 Generally the most optimal option 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.840
 ask u to sprinkle some gasoline then 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.330
 there is an intake manifold and see 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.620
 what will she do if 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 wind up means no fuel 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.300
 that is , it will already look pressure 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.270
 business here is these little things 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.860
 But if until that gasoline is also no 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.930
 emotions, too, and gasoline can be a little bit 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.370
 leave the side to look to check and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.930
 I sparkled candles and so forth 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.470
 if there is air such as this 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.470
 little thing 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.750
 saffron 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.940
 on the cube here is such cases 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.190
 there is a shorter moto star any shorter 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.310
 shorter than the ether you need specifically to 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.720
 the enemy and jump can you twist 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.630
 or even the property of the rest 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.970
 trukhanov remove this top cover 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.440
 part and plop a couple of pshik so flock 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.160
 no longer interrogated when many too 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.700
 crappy 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.680
 and if she starts in such a moment 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.530
 it means you 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.470
 ignition marks spark you fix everything 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.870
 i.e. only fuel supply remains 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.470
 fuel supply may not reach 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.770
 gasoline in the ramp can be gasoline pump 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.620
 maybe somewhere wiring here and by 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.130
 this up to the injectors can already when can 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.290
 be a relay of some kind of starter and can 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.710
 to be and computer is the most dangerous thing 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.240
 maybe that is more such I will get 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.060
 money's try 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.760
 of all those that I just called 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.730
 listed all these problems here 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.790
 and has already let us know that that what that axis 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.270
 will be needed 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.650
 talk like a car can not see how to 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.690
 you could have defined yourself 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.770
 Naturally you are far away all questions in 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.030
 comments yes all questions in comments 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.550
 have any questions ask 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.530
 Feel free to answer all the test 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.730
 I would like to add in principle if 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.910
 say that for the winter the man stood a 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.000
 if you still have a cold it is possible that 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.220
 You had to end by any sense 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.100
 contact is yours quite a lot when 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.500
 there was dropping the fuel pir for filter and he 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.410
 just frozen gas itself does not arrive 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.550
 as if this is also such a moment 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:11.380
 maybe that is first of all for leu 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:15.580
 either a gasoline syringe is called 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.480
 vozduhan let's say find explained there to 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.180
 if there is an offer 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.120
 From the side you take off the cover just you 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.210
 sound on and we write enough if not then 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.300
 you disconnect a vacuum hose 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.009
 there you sprinkle gasoline from a syringe and 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.900
 try to start there, it starts 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.900
 eliminated immediately with clamps as I said 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:43.520
 in short there is only fuel here and so 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.990
 at the end of all the end glad see 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.360
 as if it starts up in such a moment 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.819
 through gasoline and so on that is a syringe 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.599
 either a bottle of this here 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:57.919
 quick start it will be necessary already 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.900
 watch the pressure in marriage if not 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.870
 the rail pressure so the same can be 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.000
 fuel tank there everything is fine this filter 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.150
 recessed may be frozen 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.669
 that is, these moments are necessary 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:19.330
 have to look again yes wait on 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.330
 that's all for now
