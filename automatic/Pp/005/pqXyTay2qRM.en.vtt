00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.390
 in ulm around ulm and around ulm there are 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.420
 the tallest church tower in the world 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.790
 Danube and every amount of wood that use the 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.099
 city â€‹â€‹and the adjacent new ulm in 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.980
 a wood gas fired power station in 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.390
 Germany has so far been a rarity 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.940
 40,000 tonnes are used annually for this purpose 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.790
 Floating and residual wood from the area in 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.130
 a commercial area will be delivered there 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.150
 the wood remains in the nation's first 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.190
 commercially operated wood gas 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.210
 power plant to electricity and heat 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.730
 processed 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.830
 the wood does not become direct in the power plant 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.260
 burned but initially playful 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.200
 it will do so in a low-oxygen environment 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.810
 Steel container by hot sand on 900 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.970
 Grad heated so creates a gas mixture 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.239
 from hydrogen methane and carbon monoxide 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.550
 the residue escapes upwards 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.390
 wood coesfeld down into one 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.360
 combustion chamber 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.250
 this is where heated oxygen is added 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.220
 that the coke ignites the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.610
 firing chamber heated to 9 170 degrees and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.380
 supplying new energy for the adjustment 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.350
 The resulting wood gas is cooled 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.469
 cleaned and in two 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.770
 combined heat and power plants with 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:11.420
 cogeneration conducted by the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.689
 combustion of the gas produce the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.929
 both bhkw engines 31 million 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.090
 kilowatt hours of electricity a year 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.069
 In addition, the still 315 degrees hot 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.380
 Waste heat in a low oil 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.200
 boiling point collected its vapor one 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.459
 turbine drives thereby come annually 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.609
 another five million 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:33.459
 kilowatt hours of electricity finally added 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.329
 the remaining heat is transformed into a new one 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:38.359
 fed district heating network 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.130
 The power plant produces 41 per year 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.249
 million kilowatt hours of heat 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.289
 in total, 80 percent of the population will be 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.200
 used wood available energy 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.119
 With the renewable electricity can be 10,000 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.159
 households are climate-friendly 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.619
 and from the long term 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.770
 benefit from the calculable cost of heating 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.659
 commercial and local people on the spot 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 congratulate the city for the award 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.140
 as energy municipality of the month 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.570
 The agency pays tribute to this title 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.670
 renewable energy exemplary 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.360
 municipal energy projects and represents them 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.650
 on the infoportal www kommunal 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.650
