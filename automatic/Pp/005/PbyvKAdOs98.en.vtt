00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.560
It’s finally time for the next episode of VeganTV!

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.660
 Today I’m going to talk about common myths about vegans

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:22.620
Because as a vegan you often meet preconceptions and prejudices and then it’s super convenient tho have some great arguments against that!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.320
 So let’s go!

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.560
Myth number one is that vegans eat too little protein. That’s not true at all!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.160
As a vegan people often tell you ”do you eat enough protein? you look a bit tired!” and then I can assure you that you can answer ”yep!” without lying. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:56.320
The thing is that almost EVERY food contain protein. Many believe that eating meat is the only way of getting your protein, but that’s not true. 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.480
There’s protein in everything from beans and fruits to vegetables and nuts and grains. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.760
As long as you eat a little various diet and enough in quantity, it’s impossible to eat too little protein.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.960
In the west there’s almost no documented cases of lack of protein, that mainly occurs in countries where people starve.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.480
So that’s something to answer next time someone’s asking about your protein levels!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.260
Myth number 2 is that all the soy products vegans eat contributes to the destruction of rain forest. 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:49.260
Well, that’s actually a modified truth. They actually DO cut down rain forest to grow soy brand, but the thing is that 80% of that soy goes to feeding the animals in the meat industry.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:02:09.320
The 20% that goes to other things is usually certified and controlled, just look at you tofu package, there’s almost always some kind of environment marking/symbol. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.940
So it’s actually the meat eaters that contribute to the destruction of rain forest!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.320
Myth number three is that it’s impossible to work out and be a vegan.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:31.833
This isn't true at all, there’s a long list of successful vegan athletes.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:41.880
Just look at Carl Lewis, the runner who have won 8 olympics, or Keith Holmes who was the world’s best boxer.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.800
Not to speak about all the other tennis players, runners, iron man winners and so on. 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:08.940
Yeah, you can say that this myth isn’t true. If you want to work out and be a vegan it’s important to eat enough though, so you eat as much energy as you use, but it’s not about eating meat or not.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:17.280
Myth number 4 is that it’s more expensive to be a vegan than a meat eater. It’s definitely not!

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.600
Okay, if you eat bunches of fake-products as soyghurt, soy sausages, soy cheese every day it might get expensive

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:47.300
But if you just eat that sometimes and focus on the basic vegan foods as beans, grains, pasta, nuts, peas and lentils, that’s much cheaper than meat, especially if you want good/ecological meat. 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.280
Myth number five is that the vegan diet is unnatural.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:11.780
It is! Historically the hum as have lived of a plant based diet, just having meat the rare times we got hold of it. 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:23.380
Just look at our bodies! We haven’t got any claws or fangs to hunt with, and we can’t even eat raw meat without getting sick from all the bacterias.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.640
That’s not what I call a good predator. Moreover, how unnatural isn’t the meat industry? 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.640
Or drinking milk from a cow that’s meant for the baby cow? 

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.613
Nah, exactly.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.560
So! I hope you’ve gotten yourselves some good arguments for future discussions with non vegans! And something to think about. 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:08.080
Next week I’ll talk about eating vegan in social citations, like on restaurants or dinner partys. Don’t forget to check it out! 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.280
Have a great week until then! Bye!
