and<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.130> wonder<00:01:53.520> why<00:01:53.700> they're<00:01:54.030> getting<00:01:54.450> less

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and they wonder why they're getting less

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.819 
and they wonder why they're getting less
and<00:01:55.470> less<00:01:55.740> yield<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.700> their<00:01:56.969> strawberries

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
and less yield from their strawberries

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
and less yield from their strawberries
year<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.040> year<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.579> that's<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> type

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
year on year and that's because the type

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
year on year and that's because the type
of<00:02:01.110> plant<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> strawberry<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.490> creeping

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
of plant a strawberry is it's a creeping

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
of plant a strawberry is it's a creeping
plant<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.600> moves<00:02:03.930> forward<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.649> its<00:02:04.770> natural

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
plant it moves forward in its natural

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.459 
plant it moves forward in its natural
environment<00:02:05.340> by<00:02:06.210> putting<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.750> runners<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
environment by putting out runners and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.190 
environment by putting out runners and
these<00:02:08.340> runners<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.420> fresh<00:02:09.899> little

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
these runners then have fresh little

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
these runners then have fresh little
strawberry<00:02:10.770> plants<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.239> populate

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
strawberry plants on that then populate

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.820 
strawberry plants on that then populate
a<00:02:12.930> new<00:02:13.080> area

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a new area

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.120 
a new area
and<00:02:13.980> grow<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.550> vibrant<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.650> old<00:02:16.800> ones

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and grow in a vibrant and the old ones

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.030 
and grow in a vibrant and the old ones
in<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.460> area<00:02:17.940> slowly<00:02:18.350> shrivel<00:02:19.350> away<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.860> die

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
in the area slowly shrivel away and die

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.370 
in the area slowly shrivel away and die
after<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> few<00:02:20.880> seasons<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:22.110> these

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
after a few seasons and that's how these

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.160 
after a few seasons and that's how these
plants<00:02:23.370> move<00:02:23.880> forward<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.390> propagate<00:02:24.930> new

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
plants move forward and propagate new

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.160 
plants move forward and propagate new
areas<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.640> what<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:26.970> need<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.960> need

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
areas so what we need to do is we need

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.150 
areas so what we need to do is we need
really<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.930> harness<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.410> property<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
really to to to harness that property of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.450 
really to to to harness that property of
the<00:02:32.280> strawberries<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.680> get<00:02:35.010> rid<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the strawberries and to get rid of the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.250 
the strawberries and to get rid of the
old<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.300> replace<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.960> with<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.230> new

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
old and to replace them with the new

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.010 
old and to replace them with the new
strawberry<00:02:38.130> runners<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.330> vibrant

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
strawberry runners so we get vibrant

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.920 
strawberry runners so we get vibrant
fresh<00:02:40.610> strawberry<00:02:41.610> plants<00:02:42.060> every<00:02:42.420> year<00:02:42.750> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
fresh strawberry plants every year that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
fresh strawberry plants every year that
will<00:02:43.080> produce<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.470> maximum<00:02:43.770> amount<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.460> fruit

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
will produce the maximum amount of fruit

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.390 
will produce the maximum amount of fruit
for<00:02:44.910> us<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.210> it's<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.890> simple

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
for us and it's really really simple

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.100 
for us and it's really really simple
there's<00:02:47.670> no<00:02:48.030> problem<00:02:48.450> with<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.990> be

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
there's no problem with it it can be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.980 
there's no problem with it it can be
done<00:02:49.400> instantaneously<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.360> done<00:02:51.600> early

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
done instantaneously if it's done early

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.140 
done instantaneously if it's done early
enough<00:02:52.020> in<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.560> year<00:02:52.590> if<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.490> leave<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.880> late

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
enough in the year if you leave it late

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.210 
enough in the year if you leave it late
then<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.690> really<00:02:54.990> going<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> take

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
then you're really going to have to take

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.610 
then you're really going to have to take
your<00:02:56.490> runner<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:57.630> runners<00:02:58.020> off<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.440> put

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
your runner your runners off and put

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
your runner your runners off and put
them<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.860> pots<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.340> put<00:02:59.580> them<00:02:59.700> away<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.000> cold

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
them in pots and put them away in cold

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.660 
them in pots and put them away in cold
frames<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.590> forth<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.520> do

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
frames and so on and so forth if you do

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.250 
frames and so on and so forth if you do
it<00:03:02.820> now<00:03:03.270> which<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.780> right<00:03:03.990> at<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.140> beginning

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it now which is right at the beginning

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
it now which is right at the beginning
of<00:03:04.620> September<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.000> be<00:03:06.030> done<00:03:06.390> in

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
of September then it can all be done in

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.770 
of September then it can all be done in
one<00:03:06.720> simple<00:03:07.290> process<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:09.000> I'm<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.570> going<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
one simple process so I'm just going to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
one simple process so I'm just going to
show<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.020> how<00:03:10.320> that's<00:03:10.530> done<00:03:10.709> there's<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.520> I

show you how that's done there's one I
have<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> strawberry<00:03:12.600> plant<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.740> this<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.160> in

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
have a strawberry plant here this is in

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
have a strawberry plant here this is in
my<00:03:14.459> mid<00:03:14.760> season<00:03:15.090> strawberries<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.140> I'm<00:03:16.230> just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
my mid season strawberries and I'm just

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.560 
my mid season strawberries and I'm just
going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.650> take<00:03:16.830> this<00:03:17.010> one<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.209> there's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
going to take this one here and there's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.199 
going to take this one here and there's
a<00:03:18.630> runner<00:03:18.870> coming<00:03:19.380> off<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> bit<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.100> hope<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.000> can

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
a runner coming off a bit I hope you can

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870 
a runner coming off a bit I hope you can
see<00:03:21.510> there<00:03:21.780> there's<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.950> runner<00:03:23.190> coming<00:03:23.670> from

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
see there there's the runner coming from

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210 
see there there's the runner coming from
the<00:03:24.120> plant<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.720> then<00:03:24.840> there's<00:03:25.050> one<00:03:25.290> plant

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the plant and then there's one plant

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.910 
the plant and then there's one plant
being<00:03:26.550> produced<00:03:26.940> here<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.590> we're<00:03:28.769> going

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
being produced here so what we're going

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.790 
being produced here so what we're going
to<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.459> we're<00:03:29.640> going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.880> replace<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.720> old

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
to do is we're going to replace the old

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.920 
to do is we're going to replace the old
with<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.239> first<00:03:33.510> thing<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:33.750> need

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
with this one so the first thing we need

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.900 
with this one so the first thing we need
to<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.410> seems<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.070> bit<00:03:35.220> brutal<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.820> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
to do is seems a bit brutal but the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.340 
to do is seems a bit brutal but the
first<00:03:36.120> thing<00:03:36.300> we<00:03:36.420> do<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.630> we<00:03:36.720> put<00:03:36.959> up<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> old

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
first thing we do is we put up the old

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.280 
first thing we do is we put up the old
strawberry<00:03:38.180> okay<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.420> there's<00:03:39.810> two<00:03:40.019> clones

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
strawberry okay then there's two clones

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.800 
strawberry okay then there's two clones
and<00:03:40.590> then<00:03:40.739> we<00:03:40.830> pull<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.190> old<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:42.540> just

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
and then we pull up the old and we just

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.020 
and then we pull up the old and we just
give<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.290> soil<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.769> there<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.310> bit<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.820> a

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
give the soil in there a bit of a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.100 
give the soil in there a bit of a
freshen<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.980> play<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.280> our<00:03:47.550> trowel<00:03:48.110> just

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
freshen up and play with our trowel just

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.430 
freshen up and play with our trowel just
to<00:03:49.290> loosen<00:03:49.830> up<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.370> get<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.420> old<00:03:51.570> roots<00:03:52.080> all

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
to loosen up to get the old roots all

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.979 
to loosen up to get the old roots all
mushed<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.190> they're<00:03:53.700> all<00:03:53.910> good<00:03:54.180> they<00:03:54.450> will<00:03:54.600> go

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
mushed in they're all good they will go

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
mushed in they're all good they will go
down<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.470> make<00:03:55.590> good<00:03:55.800> Little<00:03:56.519> Rock<00:03:56.760> down<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
down and make good Little Rock down the

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.870 
down and make good Little Rock down the
old<00:03:57.420> root<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.050> left<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.500> right<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.890> dumas

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
old root the left and right good dumas

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.630 
old root the left and right good dumas
so<00:04:00.090> we've<00:04:00.269> now<00:04:00.450> got<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.989> hole<00:04:01.980> where<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.489> old

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
so we've now got a hole where the old

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.320 
so we've now got a hole where the old
strawberry's<00:04:03.330> weather<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:04.170> now<00:04:04.530> nice<00:04:05.489> soft

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
strawberry's weather is now nice soft

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.830 
strawberry's weather is now nice soft
soil<00:04:06.739> ready<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.040> prepared<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.730> put<00:04:09.480> our<00:04:09.660> new

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
soil ready and prepared to put our new

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.430 
soil ready and prepared to put our new
runners<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.530> all<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.840> cut<00:04:13.140> either

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
runners in it all we do is we cut either

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.719 
runners in it all we do is we cut either
side<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:15.450> runner<00:04:16.250> chop<00:04:17.250> there<00:04:17.489> leave<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
side of the runner chop there leave a

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.729 
side of the runner chop there leave a
little<00:04:18.060> bit<00:04:18.359> because<00:04:18.750> it'll<00:04:19.019> anchor<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.500> in

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
little bit because it'll anchor it in

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.370 
little bit because it'll anchor it in
you<00:04:20.100> know<00:04:20.220> that'll<00:04:20.489> help<00:04:20.750> anchor<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.989> plant

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
you know that'll help anchor the plant

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.650 
you know that'll help anchor the plant
in<00:04:22.740> because<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> hasn't<00:04:23.610> got<00:04:23.910> any<00:04:23.940> roots<00:04:24.450> yet

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
in because it hasn't got any roots yet

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.360 
in because it hasn't got any roots yet
you<00:04:24.810> can<00:04:25.020> see

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
you can see

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.310 
you can see
where<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.790> root<00:04:27.030> nodules<00:04:27.330> are<00:04:27.720> starting<00:04:28.169> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
where the root nodules are starting to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.490 
where the root nodules are starting to
appear<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:28.949> if<00:04:29.040> we<00:04:29.190> leave<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:29.580> bit<00:04:30.000> of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
appear but if we leave a little bit of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.790 
appear but if we leave a little bit of
the<00:04:32.090> of<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.900> runner<00:04:34.760> there<00:04:35.760> on<00:04:36.090> either<00:04:36.240> side

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the of the runner there on either side

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.990 
the of the runner there on either side
and<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:37.919> we<00:04:38.040> have<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.430> do<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:40.020> just<00:04:40.850> plant<00:04:41.850> it

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
and all we have to do is just plant it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.750 
and all we have to do is just plant it
in<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.330> play<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.470> nicely<00:04:44.010> prepared<00:04:44.340> soil

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
in this play in the nicely prepared soil

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.260 
in this play in the nicely prepared soil
and<00:04:45.030> there<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.229> firm<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.830> down<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.550> that's

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
and there we are firm it down and that's

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.620 
and there we are firm it down and that's
your<00:04:48.570> new<00:04:48.750> strawberry<00:04:49.320> plant<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:50.460> place<00:04:50.910> now

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
your new strawberry plant in place now

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.360 
your new strawberry plant in place now
there's<00:04:52.020> plenty<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.350> rain<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.800> time<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.220> year

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
there's plenty of rain this time of year

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.040 
there's plenty of rain this time of year
so<00:04:53.610> I'm<00:04:53.669> worried<00:04:53.880> too<00:04:54.090> much<00:04:54.120> about<00:04:54.300> watering

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
so I'm worried too much about watering

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.379 
so I'm worried too much about watering
it<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.740> root<00:04:55.979> will<00:04:56.220> very<00:04:56.550> rapidly<00:04:57.090> grow

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
it and the root will very rapidly grow

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.680 
it and the root will very rapidly grow
from<00:04:57.660> those<00:04:57.870> little<00:04:58.229> nodules<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.389> that<00:05:00.389> will

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
from those little nodules and that will

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.840 
from those little nodules and that will
produce<00:05:01.289> a<00:05:01.710> fresh<00:05:02.070> strawberry<00:05:02.220> plant<00:05:02.669> you'll

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
produce a fresh strawberry plant you'll

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.580 
produce a fresh strawberry plant you'll
get<00:05:03.060> quite<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> bit<00:05:03.570> of<00:05:03.600> growth<00:05:03.960> now<00:05:04.260> in<00:05:04.440> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
get quite a bit of growth now in the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.070 
get quite a bit of growth now in the
autumn<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.190> then<00:05:06.180> during<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.690> winter

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
autumn and then during the winter

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.350 
autumn and then during the winter
because<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.800> established<00:05:08.370> itself<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
because it's established itself that the

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.879 
because it's established itself that the
leaves<00:05:09.570> will<00:05:09.840> die<00:05:09.990> off<00:05:10.169> but<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.470> plant<00:05:10.710> will

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
leaves will die off but the plant will

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.560 
leaves will die off but the plant will
be<00:05:10.979> absolutely<00:05:11.430> fine<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.970> come<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> spring

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
be absolutely fine and come the spring

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.840 
be absolutely fine and come the spring
you<00:05:13.229> will<00:05:13.350> have<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.560> fresh<00:05:13.979> strawberry<00:05:14.280> plant

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
you will have a fresh strawberry plant

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.050 
you will have a fresh strawberry plant
that<00:05:15.030> will<00:05:15.150> give<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.600> maximum<00:05:15.930> yield<00:05:17.060> now

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
that will give you the maximum yield now

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.550 
that will give you the maximum yield now
if<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.300> keep<00:05:18.510> Strawberry<00:05:18.930> plots<00:05:19.169> as<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.350> said

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
if you keep Strawberry plots as I said

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.750 
if you keep Strawberry plots as I said
at<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> beginning<00:05:19.800> if<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.250> keep<00:05:20.430> them<00:05:20.580> year

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
at the beginning if you keep them year

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.370 
at the beginning if you keep them year
after<00:05:20.789> year<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.389> yield<00:05:21.630> of<00:05:21.780> fruit<00:05:21.960> goes<00:05:22.169> down

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
after year the yield of fruit goes down

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710 
after year the yield of fruit goes down
down<00:05:22.680> down<00:05:22.979> they<00:05:23.130> get<00:05:23.220> stripy<00:05:23.550> Australia<00:05:24.240> so

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
down down they get stripy Australia so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.360 
down down they get stripy Australia so
this<00:05:24.900> is<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.169> simple<00:05:25.560> way<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.710> do<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.130> so<00:05:26.160> I've

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
this is the simple way to do it so I've

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.969 
this is the simple way to do it so I've
got<00:05:26.520> one<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.940> there<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.530> can<00:05:28.530> choose<00:05:28.800> another

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
got one in there I can choose another

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.460 
got one in there I can choose another
runner<00:05:29.520> give<00:05:30.210> me<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.720> good<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:31.020> coming<00:05:31.380> off

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
runner give me is a good one coming off

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.440 
runner give me is a good one coming off
the<00:05:31.620> same<00:05:31.860> plant<00:05:32.190> check<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:32.700> you<00:05:32.820> getting<00:05:33.330> it

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
the same plant check that you getting it
