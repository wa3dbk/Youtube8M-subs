 just to the self-driving garage itself 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.480
 traffic she heard and never recognized 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 I find you with a lot of traffic 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.899
 second room where do I have to go from

 stop drive to your credit 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.840
 earned in I assume 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.840
 medical protests without contamination or 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.659
 no way no one goes tesla 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.840
 of rows and those on what calculated that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840
 costs 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.509
 yes I think that is 3 4 cents I have in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.490
 the meter high 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.000
 yes but all inclusive have you looked 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.150
 from what do in the groin b center or there 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.659
 is but intrigue there is in the groin mine 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.570
 cents 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.220
 jean adams i tired a new audi a5 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.329
 tired that they also have the thalys agent of dx 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 maximum between 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:39.540
 and i say i have another consultant here 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.570
 you that week their babies are going ps3 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.189
 smart belgium and we go in jerks like hey 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
 mobility projects in particular 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.970
 road pricing mileage but it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.579
 story then I could certainly candles 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.200
 something that can offer a lot of future and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.540
 that you also jump on the cart 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.820
 such is life and customers, and then you 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.409
 anyway a shows it seemed as minute as 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 a drive on the between fantastic 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 unique experience i'm going all that yes 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.330
 some knowledge and aries mini that goes 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.580
 but we'll still try 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.310
 extra cost process much possible that 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.730
 that is possible I will leave it at that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.900
 where we are you are there with agency 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.400
 roads and traffic 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.640
 you keep threatening all roads of belgium 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 yes do my best 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.520
 hey in the what did you make friend that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 had compared corner and tesla 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.200
 yes a friend of mine has the cash register 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.210
 compared to an old child number 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.490
 glaxo the model and around another car 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.800
 but in eight years and the tesla came 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.420
 as the best buy out there and you have 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 bought but I will still for it 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.900
 him for his reasons 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.610
 no peace of mind 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 super I think the 3rd choice is crime 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.640
 fighters has text messages to him 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.190
 we congratulate his choice 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.430
 what does the agency do with its say 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.830
 but 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.420
 it show description so the cars that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.080
 drive 7 itself can already do it 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.790
 and we had the helm we have 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.290
 all that debt service is interesting 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.840
 makes us know what we should no longer do 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.300
 along the way and there are not immediately 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890
 will be the tractors of oh you are especially 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.450
 interested modernity what you don't 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 have to do 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.130
 yes cozy yes that will be a whole lot 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.140
 hope consultant fire it into use too 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.790
 then our experience and and also 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.180
 convinced that for electrical 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.950
 all that electrical the future is without 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.850
 doubt 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.380
 for me it was also supplementary 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.720
 reason to end up that way 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.130
 you want to contribute to just about here 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.570
 practical life what i have done i 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 have looked into a year in it 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.620
 past how do i achieve a 5 and a 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.840
 percent of the days you just met 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.160
 radius of action as I think 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.500
 think a very good stop to say 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.280
 do it and those fast chargers are everywhere 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.260
 by we not always winter better after a lot 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.440
