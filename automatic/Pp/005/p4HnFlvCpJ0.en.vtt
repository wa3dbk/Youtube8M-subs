 Hello everyone, today I want to show you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.230
 how to repair a broken nail by going 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.150
 to create a sort of nail patch 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 in my case I see you adopt 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.070
 the extra thumb nail going to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.529
 take off the nail polish that was on me 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.320
 also engaged in color the need 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.990
 for this repair is a sachet of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 tea a nail glue file is the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 your favorite base think that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.250
 there are even kits that cost 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 about 45 euros but we obviously prefer 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 does everything at home by spending 0 let's go to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.680
 apply a bit of glue for long is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.680
 on the verge of rupture 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.239
 we apply them hate corner of bussi 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.239
 narita that we went to cut 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:02.450
 I'm going to commit all of glue 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:18.920
 rectangles wanting we can go to 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 apply a second status when in 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.640
 everything has dried we go animal for 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.640
 smooth the surface 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 once completely leveled 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.070
 the nail we can go to pass the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.070
 our transparent base 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 you see that the damage cannot be seen 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.070
 practically more for this technique 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.650
 we can also use enamel 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.560
 transparent instead of the single glue 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.360
 sin is that the result 2 to less than me 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 I do it more than anything else to not go to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 cut the nail evenly because a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.780
 sometimes it causes me a little burning of 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 you can bother with this method instead 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.500
 go and earn some time for 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
 grow the nail once 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700
 grown up you can go and cut it or 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.490
 to remove the repair with 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.230
 hot water and acetone I hope this 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.400
