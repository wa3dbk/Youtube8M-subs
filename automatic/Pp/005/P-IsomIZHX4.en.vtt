00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello popular racing friends today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 let's present the importance of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.240
 core the core is fundamental for everything 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.099
 runner either mountain or asphalt 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.540
 It is very important to work all 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.030
 core muscles and not just the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 sit-ups like people who think there's 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.070
 that work the abs the parts 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.760
 low backs the glutes and the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.170
 psoas the core would be the so-called 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.210
 abdominal waist responsible for giving 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.349
 stability and buffer the impacts to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 those who undergo the spine 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 It is very important for athletes 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 since in addition to protecting our 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 column of possible injuries we 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.219
 will provide more performance is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 important to understand that the core does 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 transition between the bottom of the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.100
 body with the top the first 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 exercises for fundamentals for 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.149
 core and most important would be the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.980
 isometric those that dominate us lists 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 geometric are an exercise that is going 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.370
 to serve the runner to make it more 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.969
 Stable the abdominal area while 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.969
 we run 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.930
 the second one is called the ub and you can 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 perform in static or uploading and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.750
 lowering the feet it is important to avoid 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.970
 always the impulse the neck and the head 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 and the shoulders should remain relaxed 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 and supported the lower back should not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
 detach from the ground when descending 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.760
 legs and if your back arches 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.530
 we must descend less the legs to 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.700
 prevent this from happening the next 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.930
 exercise 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.510
 they would be abdominal with legs 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.509
 raised and crossing the arms that 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.880
 they would be holding their heads in a way 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.340
 crossed the last exercise would be the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.490
 normal abdominals by placing the hands 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 in the chest or in the neck avoiding 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 always force the neck area and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.710
 controlling at all times the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710
 contraction of the two 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 these abdominal exercises you can 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 perform two or three times a week and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.909
 I hope that or if they will improve as 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.909
 runners
