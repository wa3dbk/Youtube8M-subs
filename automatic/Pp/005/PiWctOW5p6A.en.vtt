body I'm going to show you how to do is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.490 
body I'm going to show you how to do is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.420 
get into the body of the camera and onto
the<00:00:28.680> sensor<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.939> here's<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.050> oh

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
the sensor so here's how you do it oh

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.580 
the sensor so here's how you do it oh
I'm<00:00:32.430> using<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.000> rebel<00:00:33.329> XT<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I'm using a rebel XT here but this

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
I'm using a rebel XT here but this
should<00:00:34.739> work<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.980> most<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.550> most<00:00:36.360> digital

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
should work on most and most digital

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.170 
should work on most and most digital
SLRs<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:38.460> lens<00:00:38.820> release<00:00:39.030> button

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
SLRs that is and my lens release button

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
SLRs that is and my lens release button
is<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> left<00:00:40.379> side<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.579> yours<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
is here on the left side so if yours is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.250 
is here on the left side so if yours is
in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> different<00:00:42.540> position<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.020> might<00:00:43.140> need

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
in a different position you might need

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
in a different position you might need
to<00:00:43.410> adjust<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
from and I'm just going to stand up to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
from and I'm just going to stand up to
show<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.350> right

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
show you this you take it in your right

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
show you this you take it in your right
hand<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> hold<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.729> thumb<00:01:24.330> index

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
hand and hold it with your thumb index

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
hand and hold it with your thumb index
finger<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.979> middle<00:01:26.159> finger<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.759> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
finger and middle finger now it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
finger and middle finger now it's
probably<00:01:28.080> easiest<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.890> line<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.700> thumb

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
probably easiest if you line your thumb

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
probably easiest if you line your thumb
up<00:01:30.650> with<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.310> um<00:01:33.619> indicator<00:01:34.619> dot<00:01:34.890> now

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
up with the little um indicator dot now

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
up with the little um indicator dot now
in<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> case<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> red<00:01:36.329> dot<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.720> means

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in this case it's a red dot which means

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
in this case it's a red dot which means
this<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.380> EF<00:01:37.710> lens<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> white

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
this is an EF lens if it was a white

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.300 
this is an EF lens if it was a white
square<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.170> mean<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.590> EFS<00:01:41.040> lens

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
square that would mean it's an EFS lens

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
square that would mean it's an EFS lens
but<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.640> essentially<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> same<00:01:42.600> thing

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
but it's essentially the same thing

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.569 
but it's essentially the same thing
either<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:44.130> sure<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.399> that's

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
either way just make sure that that's

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
either way just make sure that that's
pointing<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.869> shouldn't<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.290> much

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
pointing up and you shouldn't have much

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.030 
pointing up and you shouldn't have much
trouble<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.720> grab<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.009> hand

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
trouble so grab that in your right hand

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.960 
trouble so grab that in your right hand
as<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.960> mentioned<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> take

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the body or the tip of the lens that's

finger and the back of your your palm so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.730 
finger and the back of your your palm so
now<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:11.190> actually<00:02:11.310> hold

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
now you can actually hold

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.160 
now you can actually hold
the<00:02:12.860> lens<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.760> camera<00:02:14.210> by<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.450> tip<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.050> the

the lens the camera by the tip of the
lens<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.650> now<00:02:16.490> you<00:02:16.550> don't<00:02:16.700> want<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.150> that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
lens and now you don't want to do that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.500 
lens and now you don't want to do that
necessarily<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.790> know<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.210> that's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
necessarily but you know that that's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.880 
necessarily but you know that that's
basically<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.140> type<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.320> grip<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.710> you

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
basically the type of grip that you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
basically the type of grip that you
should<00:02:22.100> have<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.510> what<00:02:23.810> you're<00:02:23.930> going

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
should have on it so what you're going

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
should have on it so what you're going
to<00:02:24.080> do<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.530> hold<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.490> then<00:02:25.760> perpendicular<00:02:26.390> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
to do is hold it then perpendicular to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.880 
to do is hold it then perpendicular to
each<00:02:26.720> other<00:02:26.930> as<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.650> see<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:29.740> make<00:02:30.740> sure

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
each other as you can see and make sure

this is an EFS lens the white square

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.310 
this is an EFS lens the white square
just<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> point<00:02:48.320> that<00:02:48.470> out<00:02:50.080> rotate<00:02:51.080> them

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
just going to point that out rotate them

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.630 
just going to point that out rotate them
and<00:02:52.300> there<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.420> go<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.650> one<00:02:54.800> other<00:02:54.950> thing<00:02:55.040> I'm

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and there you go the one other thing I'm

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.370 
and there you go the one other thing I'm
just<00:02:55.820> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:55.970> switch<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.390> back<00:02:56.420> once<00:02:56.900> more

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
just going to switch it back once more

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.600 
just going to switch it back once more
um<00:02:57.850> one<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> few<00:02:59.390> things<00:02:59.630> here<00:02:59.840> first<00:02:59.990> of<00:03:00.290> all

um one a few things here first of all

the body of the camera pointed down and
if<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.600> that<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.960> you<00:03:06.380> know<00:03:06.500> try<00:03:07.100> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
if you can do that and you know try to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.520 
if you can do that and you know try to
shoot<00:03:07.520> for<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:09.110> body<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.410> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
of time here that it probably won't

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
matter that much unless you're in some

kind of sandstorm or in a really dusty

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.320 
kind of sandstorm or in a really dusty
environment<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.220> if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.520> can<00:03:16.730> try<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.090> point

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
environment but if you can try and point

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.210 
environment but if you can try and point
the<00:03:17.450> body<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.780> camera<00:03:18.080> down<00:03:18.200> when<00:03:19.070> you're

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the body of the camera down when you're

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.240 
the body of the camera down when you're
doing<00:03:19.520> this<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.330> if<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.480> do<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.780> that

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
doing this so if you do it like that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.830 
doing this so if you do it like that
the<00:03:22.640> problem<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.030> pointing<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.360> down<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the problem with pointing it down is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.520 
the problem with pointing it down is
that<00:03:24.080> in<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.650> case<00:03:24.920> via<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.540> flash<00:03:26.870> area

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
that in this case via the flash area

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.010 
that in this case via the flash area
here<00:03:27.920> actually<00:03:28.160> blocks<00:03:28.760> me<00:03:29.270> from<00:03:29.510> seeing<00:03:29.870> the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
here actually blocks me from seeing the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.780 
here actually blocks me from seeing the
indicator<00:03:30.440> dot<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.860> lining<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.400> properly

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
indicator dot and lining it up properly

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.700 
indicator dot and lining it up properly
so<00:03:32.300> it's<00:03:32.450> probably<00:03:32.720> easier<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.140> point<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.530> up

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
so it's probably easier to point it up

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.230 
so it's probably easier to point it up
but<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.340> really<00:03:34.610> want<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.820> try<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> avoid

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
but you really want to try to avoid

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.180 
but you really want to try to avoid
doing<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.660> if<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.900> can<00:03:36.190> also<00:03:37.480> practice<00:03:38.480> this

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
doing that if you can also practice this

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.530 
doing that if you can also practice this
over<00:03:40.190> your<00:03:40.340> bed<00:03:40.520> or<00:03:40.820> your<00:03:41.060> carpet<00:03:41.480> or

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
over your bed or your carpet or

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.400 
over your bed or your carpet or
something<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.470> if<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:42.710> drop<00:03:42.980> your<00:03:43.250> lens<00:03:43.430> um

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
something so if you drop your lens um

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.980 
something so if you drop your lens um
you<00:03:45.410> don't<00:03:45.500> blame<00:03:45.830> me<00:03:46.100> for<00:03:46.810> destroying<00:03:47.810> your

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
you don't blame me for destroying your

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.530 
you don't blame me for destroying your
thousand<00:03:48.830> dollar<00:03:48.980> however<00:03:49.280> much<00:03:49.540> these

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
thousand dollar however much these

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.290 
thousand dollar however much these
things<00:03:50.600> cost<00:03:51.880> one<00:03:52.880> other<00:03:53.030> thing<00:03:53.240> is<00:03:55.060> there's<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
things cost one other thing is there's a

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.630 
things cost one other thing is there's a
potential<00:03:56.870> problem<00:03:57.020> if<00:03:57.590> you're<00:03:57.860> going<00:03:58.070> from<00:03:58.430> a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
potential problem if you're going from a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.570 
potential problem if you're going from a
really<00:03:59.150> large<00:03:59.450> lens<00:03:59.810> like<00:04:00.140> this<00:04:00.170> 70<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:00.860> 300

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
really large lens like this 70 to 300

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.250 
really large lens like this 70 to 300
which<00:04:01.940> has<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.570> know<00:04:02.660> sixty<00:04:03.080> two

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
which has a you know sixty two

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.800 
which has a you know sixty two
millimeter<00:04:03.920> diameter<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.700> if<00:04:05.390> you're<00:04:05.600> going

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
millimeter diameter and if you're going

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
millimeter diameter and if you're going
if<00:04:06.050> you're<00:04:06.230> going<00:04:06.500> from<00:04:06.830> that<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.340> really

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
if you're going from that to a really

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.380 
if you're going from that to a really
short<00:04:08.000> lens<00:04:08.270> like<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:08.660> fifty<00:04:10.060> one<00:04:11.060> point

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
short lens like this fifty one point

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.840 
short lens like this fifty one point
eight<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:12.890> problem<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.520> if<00:04:13.640> the

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
eight and the problem is that if the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.000 
eight and the problem is that if the
length<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.330> this<00:04:14.450> lens<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:15.080> shorter<00:04:15.590> than<00:04:15.830> the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
length of this lens is shorter than the

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.830 
length of this lens is shorter than the
diameter<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.060> lens<00:04:17.180> you're<00:04:17.420> going<00:04:17.660> with

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
diameter of the lens you're going with

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.170 
diameter of the lens you're going with
then<00:04:18.320> gripping<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.859> like<00:04:19.010> this<00:04:19.250> doesn't

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
then gripping it like this doesn't

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.600 
then gripping it like this doesn't
really<00:04:20.299> work<00:04:20.420> because<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.020> can<00:04:21.140> see<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:22.040> even

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
really work because you can see and even

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.210 
really work because you can see and even
if<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:22.850> stick<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.510> out<00:04:23.600> like<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.260> have<00:04:25.190> a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
if you stick it out like that you have a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.140 
if you stick it out like that you have a
weaker<00:04:25.580> grip<00:04:25.850> on

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
weaker grip on

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.749 
weaker grip on
whole<00:04:26.300> thing<00:04:26.600> which<00:04:27.350> isn't<00:04:27.530> good<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.610> also

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
whole thing which isn't good and it also

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.999 
whole thing which isn't good and it also
it's<00:04:29.300> still<00:04:29.690> kind<00:04:30.169> of<00:04:30.229> difficult<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.650> do<00:04:30.800> so

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
it's still kind of difficult to do so

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.159 
it's still kind of difficult to do so
what<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.190> do<00:04:31.340> instead<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.970> make<00:04:32.870> sure<00:04:32.900> that

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
what you do instead is make sure that

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.999 
what you do instead is make sure that
you've<00:04:33.290> got<00:04:33.470> your<00:04:33.620> lens<00:04:33.860> caps<00:04:34.160> on<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:36.009> place

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
you've got your lens caps on and place

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.560 
you've got your lens caps on and place
the<00:04:37.250> two<00:04:37.430> lenses<00:04:38.889> end-to-end<00:04:40.060> or<00:04:41.060> head<00:04:41.449> to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
the two lenses end-to-end or head to

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.050 
the two lenses end-to-end or head to
head<00:04:41.780> if<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.080> will<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:43.430> generally<00:04:43.940> want

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
head if you will and you generally want

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.230 
head if you will and you generally want
to<00:04:44.180> do<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.479> with<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.840> indicator<00:04:45.380> dot

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
to do this with that indicator dot

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.620 
to do this with that indicator dot
pointing<00:04:47.240> upward<00:04:48.160> towards<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:50.479> if

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
pointing upward towards you and so if

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.180 
pointing upward towards you and so if
you<00:04:50.750> hold<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.080> camera<00:04:51.259> so<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.830> back<00:04:52.009> of

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
you hold the camera so that the back of

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.219 
you hold the camera so that the back of
its<00:04:52.310> facing<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.940> you're<00:04:53.570> going<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:53.750> place<00:04:53.990> it

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
its facing you you're going to place it

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.800 
its facing you you're going to place it
so<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.800> front<00:04:55.070> of<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:56.150> lens<00:04:56.479> is

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
so that the front of the lens is

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.659 
so that the front of the lens is
pointing<00:04:57.500> towards<00:04:57.860> so<00:04:58.070> they're<00:04:58.220> they're<00:04:58.520> both

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
pointing towards so they're they're both

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.210 
pointing towards so they're they're both
lens<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.300> lens<00:04:59.479> or<00:04:59.780> front<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.169> front<00:05:00.320> that

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
lens to lens or front to front that

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.640 
lens to lens or front to front that
indicator<00:05:01.729> dot<00:05:01.940> should<00:05:02.330> probably<00:05:02.660> be<00:05:02.930> twisted

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
indicator dot should probably be twisted

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.600 
indicator dot should probably be twisted
slightly<00:05:04.900> counterclockwise<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.190> want<00:05:07.490> to

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
slightly counterclockwise so you want to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.129 
slightly counterclockwise so you want to
be<00:05:07.729> around<00:05:07.910> 11<00:05:08.240> o'clock<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.690> reason<00:05:08.960> is<00:05:09.080> that

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
be around 11 o'clock the reason is that

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.719 
be around 11 o'clock the reason is that
when<00:05:09.410> you<00:05:09.500> twist<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:10.010> lens<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.430> actually

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
when you twist the lens it's actually

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.219 
when you twist the lens it's actually
going<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:10.940> move<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.330> want<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.780> be<00:05:11.900> over

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
going to move so you want it to be over

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.010 
going to move so you want it to be over
here<00:05:12.260> instead<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:13.010> over<00:05:13.250> here<00:05:13.690> hold<00:05:14.690> them<00:05:14.840> end

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
here instead of over here hold them end

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.900 
here instead of over here hold them end
to<00:05:15.080> end<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.560> basically<00:05:16.370> you're<00:05:16.639> going<00:05:16.729> to<00:05:16.789> do

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
to end and basically you're going to do

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.490 
to end and basically you're going to do
the<00:05:17.060> same<00:05:17.240> thing<00:05:17.570> except<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.139> time<00:05:18.320> you're

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
the same thing except this time you're

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.930 
the same thing except this time you're
going<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.680> move<00:05:18.800> your<00:05:18.860> hands<00:05:19.460> all<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.849> way

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
going to move your hands all the way

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.990 
going to move your hands all the way
around<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.750> if<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:21.139> press<00:05:21.349> that<00:05:21.620> little<00:05:21.830> um<00:05:22.190> lens

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
around so if I press that little um lens

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.770 
around so if I press that little um lens
release<00:05:23.410> twist<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:25.389> just<00:05:26.389> move<00:05:26.599> the<00:05:26.750> whole

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
release twist and just move the whole

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.900 
release twist and just move the whole
thing<00:05:27.229> around<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.770> there<00:05:28.190> you<00:05:28.310> go<00:05:28.460> I<00:05:28.639> just

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
thing around and there you go I just

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.080 
thing around and there you go I just
switched<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.570> two<00:05:29.720> lenses<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:30.710> quickly<00:05:31.130> and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
switched the two lenses that quickly and

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.830 
switched the two lenses that quickly and
to<00:05:32.599> go<00:05:32.750> back<00:05:33.190> you're<00:05:34.190> going<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.340> hold<00:05:34.520> them

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
to go back you're going to hold them

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.029 
to go back you're going to hold them
perpendicular<00:05:35.840> again<00:05:36.080> cause<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.560> creating

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
perpendicular again cause it creating

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.180 
perpendicular again cause it creating
that<00:05:37.160> right<00:05:37.520> angle<00:05:38.470> so<00:05:39.470> if<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.620> just<00:05:39.800> grab<00:05:40.010> that

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
that right angle so if I just grab that

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.390 
that right angle so if I just grab that
I'll<00:05:41.060> go<00:05:41.210> like<00:05:41.360> that<00:05:41.570> and<00:05:41.840> it's<00:05:42.530> that<00:05:42.830> simple

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
I'll go like that and it's that simple

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.820 
I'll go like that and it's that simple
I'm<00:05:43.669> just<00:05:43.970> going<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.120> put<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.479> 18<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:45.080> 55<00:05:45.530> back

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
I'm just going to put the 18 to 55 back

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.560 
I'm just going to put the 18 to 55 back
on<00:05:46.099> and<00:05:47.320> there<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.409> go<00:05:48.909> changing<00:05:49.909> lenses<00:05:50.120> is

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
on and there you go changing lenses is

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.830 
on and there you go changing lenses is
that<00:05:51.169> simple<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:54.789> yeah<00:05:55.789> so<00:05:56.479> that's<00:05:56.630> pretty

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
that simple and yeah so that's pretty

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.490 
that simple and yeah so that's pretty
much<00:05:56.960> it<00:05:57.169> I<00:05:57.320> hope<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:57.919> was<00:05:58.010> helpful<00:05:58.039> to<00:05:58.370> you
