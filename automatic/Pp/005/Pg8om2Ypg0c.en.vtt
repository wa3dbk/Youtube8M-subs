00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
sniper you Europe really want to use

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.060

it's a one shot so you'll see here a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250 
it's a one shot so you'll see here a
noscope<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.150> got<00:02:49.360> quite<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.690> ride<00:02:49.900> wide

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
noscope it's got quite a ride wide

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.290 
noscope it's got quite a ride wide
spread<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.800> this<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.190> relatively<00:02:51.730> close

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
spread and this is relatively close

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.600 
spread and this is relatively close
range<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:53.140> well<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:57.220> very<00:02:57.460> over

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
range as well but it is to very over

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.490 
range as well but it is to very over
spread<00:02:57.850> for<00:02:58.090> sniper<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:58.990> try<00:02:59.290> not<00:02:59.320> to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
spread for sniper so just try not to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.330 
spread for sniper so just try not to
noscope<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.070> Lester<00:03:00.570> point-blank<00:03:01.570> range<00:03:02.340> so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
noscope on Lester point-blank range so

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.530 
noscope on Lester point-blank range so
right<00:03:03.730> here<00:03:03.880> I'm<00:03:03.970> gonna<00:03:04.060> show<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.360> little

right here I'm gonna show you a little

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.090 
right here I'm gonna show you a little
bit<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.660> quick<00:03:04.810> scoping<00:03:05.140> with<00:03:05.710> Chris<00:03:05.920> cope

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
bit of quick scoping with Chris cope

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.440 
bit of quick scoping with Chris cope
when<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.280> got<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.490> make<00:03:06.580> sure<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:07.030> aim<00:03:07.210> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
when you got to make sure you aim the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.240 
when you got to make sure you aim the
full<00:03:07.630> way<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.020> let<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> scope<00:03:08.830> go<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.070> whole

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
full way and let the scope go the whole

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.010 
full way and let the scope go the whole
way<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.430> I'll<00:03:10.210> just<00:03:10.450> be<00:03:10.600> pretty<00:03:10.840> much

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
way and I'll just be pretty much

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.210 
way and I'll just be pretty much
perfectly<00:03:11.620> accurate<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:13.950> again<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.070> got<00:03:15.190> a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
perfectly accurate so again you got a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.830 
perfectly accurate so again you got a
standstill<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.270> are<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.690> most

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
standstill the are but the most

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.570 
standstill the are but the most
important<00:03:17.350> come<00:03:17.530> for<00:03:17.860> shooting<00:03:18.310> with<00:03:18.459> your

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
important come for shooting with your

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.340 
important come for shooting with your
half<00:03:18.880> reduced<00:03:19.239> arm<00:03:19.450> still<00:03:19.720> when<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.989> take<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
half reduced arm still when you take the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.410 
half reduced arm still when you take the
shot<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.220> you've<00:03:21.340> got<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> move<00:03:21.760> take<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> sharp

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
shot so you've got a move take a sharp

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.600 
shot so you've got a move take a sharp
move<00:03:22.720> take<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> shot<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.770> know<00:03:24.220> what<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.459> got

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
then move so this here's our DeSean just

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.160 
then move so this here's our DeSean just
give<00:03:30.670> an<00:03:30.760> example<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:31.330> what<00:03:31.510> happens<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:31.959> your

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
give an example of what happens if your

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.110 
give an example of what happens if your
move<00:03:32.350> on<00:03:32.500> my<00:03:32.620> list<00:03:32.800> shoot<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.520> bullet<00:03:33.820> that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
move on my list shoot the bullet that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.580 
move on my list shoot the bullet that
does<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.540> can't<00:03:34.810> even<00:03:35.080> see<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> bullet

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
does that you can't even see the bullet

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.420 
does that you can't even see the bullet
it<00:03:35.920> messes<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.550> much<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.250> goes

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
it messes that much it just goes

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.540 
it messes that much it just goes
absolutely<00:03:39.700> work<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.860> that's<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.340> next

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
absolutely work and that's the next

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.400 
absolutely work and that's the next
thing<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.870> how<00:03:43.959> you're<00:03:44.110> supposed
