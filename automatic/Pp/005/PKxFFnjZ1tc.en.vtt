00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.050
 the winner of the goalkeeper Carsten 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 René Adler has the flying license for the Biennale 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.309
 on Monday 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.380
 the official election 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.060
 stay in the Bundestag 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.050
 That's the decision 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.140
 the team plays joyfully and 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.439
 in the school kitchen 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.869
 also be fair 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 a decision against Tim Wiese 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 and against the other wm candidate Manuel newer 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.769
 Adler's dream can 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.660
 only a performance low 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.330
 "I suppose now that one kind has this form he has so far 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.160
 would have 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.470
 where he also convinced us in the games against Russia for example in 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.670
 important games 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 So holding this shape and then it's pretty good 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.990
 Forward question decided more decisions to follow at the next 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.560
 Consequence in wm-third high an important chapter went 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.840
 who plays alongside Ballack 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.210
 in the cast was firmly scheduled 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 Schweinsteiger also especially new role as a template for men like 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.090
 tomatoes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.240
 Müller shone 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.869
 Before its premiere, Toni Kroos also all have good wm chances 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.270
 because they convince in key positions 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.690
 It's just the good footballer who have the football to play 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.930
 and I want people to be able to go on the offensive 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 to go and score or even prepare for nature 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.690
 and do not always hold that position and do nothing else - if 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.580
 I would like to distribute soon there from Dessau Dießen central positions 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.040
 Accents forward 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.890
 Podolski played »side ​​23 hours without this but in the dfb-eleven 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.190
 play three hits in four 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.870
 even Klose he finally convinced only in the air 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.510
 in the club 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.569
 Of course, they are in the shape crisis about it makes you think 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.210
 and above 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.420
 you have to talk to them but I know they have quality and that 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.730
 Exploit data collector 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.329
 looking for quality 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.809
 only having a good game against Argentina can be a positive one 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.809
 wm mood can be generated 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.289
 Argentinian you a great opponent and now already once 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.199
 to see PS are on the way to South Africa 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:31.129
 he raises early 2010, he received his future 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.669
 open 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.259
 End of a cordial relationship with Brazil's twenties 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.009
 Overall, of course, you have percent on it 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.829
 Mistakes made in the outside pocket must have met contract negotiations Alba two 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.279
 that's how the main task is for us to focus on 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.989
 what the team is concerned about the World Cup to prepare us properly 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.489
 prepare world champion 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.209
 scheduled for the bear timetable 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.979
 Eagle the winner 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:56.339
