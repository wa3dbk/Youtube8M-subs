00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.120
 hello people welcome to my second 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.160
 video and in this video i would like 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.429
 show you how to make happy birthday 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.190
 one side I wanted to play in 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.690
 my first videos are the treads 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.340
 are you can find below in the link 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:24.160
 description said that I as 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.000
 next snowflake white skirts 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.860
 show but would I have that to me 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.590
 Let's go and think 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.030
 for beginners it is even if it 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.000
 Maybe the song is simple 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.130
 a bit difficult and that's why I want to 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.070
 only start with the beginning 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.670
 So as I said it is now happy 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:55.120
 birthday and you just need it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 the high side the lowest and then 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.070
 Let's start 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.050
 So as we said we need us 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.440
 only the lowest e string is the one 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.490
 highest and we play first 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.490
 twice at very 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.550
 then we press with our index finger 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.570
 or with any singer could too 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.020
 take the middle finger on the second 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020
 Federation 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.010
 and empty again 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 so that's what it says here 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:44.439
 then the 2005 and that is with the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.439
 one with the first point 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.680
 So still ask you can with 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 play 123 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 then we do the same again 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.700
 and this time we go to the seventh 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.390
 reason that is the second point here 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.390
 under the fifth 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.400
 then we play that you are again 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 two times more 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:32.750
 then we'll take twelve tribes with you 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.750
 two points the ninth 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.520
 and then again a fifth the game 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.520
 happened twice 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.780
 once 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.460
 and again a second and then go 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.000
 the tenth twice 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.000
 not at all 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.740
 in the fifth 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.090
 the captain and again the fifth 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.090
 now you are on 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.069
 So that was the day of one side 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:35.849
 and there's such a he a 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.269
 Variation with suffering as hear 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.269
 This is how it is 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.540
 Sorry 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.959
 So yes, so the suffering is like him 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.840
 presses on the bund in which the state has 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.030
 lucky data 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.470
 and pull on the neck in the waistband we go 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.170
 in the rhine so for example 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.570
 now in the fifth then I do that 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.570
 so I hit her and pull up 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.100
 So that was the second variant 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:38.669
 that means he simply suffers from the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:45.490
 different reasons and now one more 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:49.270
 small tip if you so if you 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.610
 have problems with the circle and there is 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.130
 It always gets better when we get closer to that 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.410
 so colorful chopsticks is not so 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.840
 that is indeed still is 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.720
 in the second bunch but if it is here 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.460
 it over here give me one goes here 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.200
 then it just feels better that's it 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.270
 then already from happy birthday 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.590
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.030
 and then I had the next one 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.870
 However, I also have to know what he is 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.240
 for songs would like to have on one side 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.889
 and you just write in the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.780
 comments what I am for you 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:31.080
 should rewrite and until the next 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.080
 times
