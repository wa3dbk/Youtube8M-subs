listening to this might say to yourself
that's<00:01:34.409> ridiculous<00:01:35.009> why<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's ridiculous why would you want to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's ridiculous why would you want to
lift<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.970> supercar<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> fun<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
lift a supercar that's the fun of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.740 
lift a supercar that's the fun of
modding<00:01:38.310> though<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> fun<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
modding though that's that's the fun of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.690 
modding though that's that's the fun of
it<00:01:39.810> being<00:01:40.020> able<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.560> mods<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> vehicle<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it being able to do mods to vehicle that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.130 
it being able to do mods to vehicle that
would<00:01:41.850> never<00:01:42.150> actually<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:42.780> mods<00:01:42.990> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
would never actually have those mods in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
would never actually have those mods in
real<00:01:43.350> life<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> fun<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.250> video<00:01:44.520> game

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
real life that's the fun of a video game

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
real life that's the fun of a video game
and<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.420> why<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.960> such

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and that's why I think it would be such

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
and that's why I think it would be such
an<00:01:46.259> awesome<00:01:46.380> addition<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> game<00:01:47.399> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
an awesome addition to the game so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.219 
an awesome addition to the game so
that's<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:48.329> thing<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> list<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that's the first thing on the list the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.389 
that's the first thing on the list the
second<00:01:49.560> thing<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.159> supplement

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
second thing I think would supplement

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.700 
second thing I think would supplement
the<00:01:50.729> lift<00:01:50.909> kits<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.229> even

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the lift kits very well and that's even

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
the lift kits very well and that's even
bigger<00:01:52.920> better<00:01:53.549> off-road<00:01:54.299> tires<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
bigger better off-road tires I know that

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.749 
bigger better off-road tires I know that
right<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:55.560> we've<00:01:55.829> we've<00:01:56.100> got<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.369> off-road

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
right now we've we've got the off-road

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370

the dirt you know I think that would be
once<00:02:17.550> again<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.940> pretty<00:02:18.150> easy<00:02:18.480> thing<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:18.810> them

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
once again a pretty easy thing for them

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.900 
once again a pretty easy thing for them
to<00:02:19.260> add<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.740> not<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.070> some<00:02:20.280> hole<00:02:20.520> entirely

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to add it's not like some hole entirely

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 
to add it's not like some hole entirely
new<00:02:21.210> mechanic<00:02:21.660> it's<00:02:22.050> simply<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> new<00:02:22.590> tire<00:02:22.890> a

Grand Theft Auto online we see them on

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.430 
Grand Theft Auto online we see them on
the<00:03:27.150> first<00:03:27.360> vehicles<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.170> are<00:03:28.230> not

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the first vehicles but they are not

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.190 
the first vehicles but they are not
actually<00:03:28.890> functional<00:03:29.370> which<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.780> bit<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.140> a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
actually functional which is a bit of a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.960 
actually functional which is a bit of a
disappointment<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.800> me<00:03:31.950> um<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.430> know<00:03:32.610> that's<00:03:32.880> an

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
disappointment to me um I know that's an

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
disappointment to me um I know that's an
entirely<00:03:33.420> new<00:03:33.900> mechanic<00:03:34.470> there's<00:03:34.739> nothing

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
entirely new mechanic there's nothing

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.260 
entirely new mechanic there's nothing
else<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.580> in<00:03:35.790> Grand<00:03:36.000> Theft<00:03:36.120> Auto

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
else like that in Grand Theft Auto

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.150 
else like that in Grand Theft Auto
online<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.989> that's<00:03:37.350> probably<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:37.950> what<00:03:38.130> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
online and that's probably not what I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.770 
online and that's probably not what I
would<00:03:38.340> consider<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.820> simple<00:03:39.420> thing<00:03:39.630> to

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
would consider a simple thing to

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.360 
would consider a simple thing to
implement<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.739> would<00:03:40.830> definitely<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.340> my

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
implement but it would definitely in my

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.949 
implement but it would definitely in my
opinion<00:03:41.820> be<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.060> update<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.390> would<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.840> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
opinion be an update that would get a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.020 
opinion be an update that would get a
lot<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.350> attention<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.010> lot<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.190> use<00:03:44.430> think

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
lot of attention and a lot of use think

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.340 
lot of attention and a lot of use think
how<00:03:45.120> often<00:03:45.420> you're<00:03:45.540> off-roading<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.200> your

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
help your friend just walk up to the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.280 
help your friend just walk up to the
front<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> your<00:03:59.940> vehicle<00:04:00.000> reel<00:04:00.959> out<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.140> winch

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
front of your vehicle reel out the winch

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
front of your vehicle reel out the winch
attach<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.190> his<00:04:02.280> car<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:03.150> slowly

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
attach it to his car and then slowly

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420 
attach it to his car and then slowly
drag<00:04:03.840> him<00:04:04.050> out<00:04:04.200> now<00:04:04.500> obviously<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.070> real<00:04:05.220> life

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
drag him out now obviously in real life

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.740 
drag him out now obviously in real life
okay<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.850> engine<00:04:06.000> would<00:04:06.270> probably<00:04:06.600> already

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
okay the engine would probably already

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.420 
okay the engine would probably already
be<00:04:06.959> flooded<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.530> everything<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.370> would

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
be flooded and everything and it would

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.220 
be flooded and everything and it would
probably<00:04:08.610> be<00:04:08.940> too<00:04:09.150> far<00:04:09.330> gone<00:04:09.480> but<00:04:09.540> hey<00:04:09.840> we

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
probably be too far gone but hey we

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.840 
probably be too far gone but hey we
don't<00:04:10.350> need<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.680> be<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:11.010> realistic<00:04:11.700> I

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
don't need it to be that realistic I

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.280 
don't need it to be that realistic I
just<00:04:12.120> think<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.330> working<00:04:12.510> winches<00:04:12.959> would<00:04:13.170> be

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
just think that working winches would be

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.350 
just think that working winches would be
very<00:04:13.530> cool<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.820> fourth<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
very cool and now for the fourth and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.970 
very cool and now for the fourth and
final<00:04:15.600> thing<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.169> thought<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.799> the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
final thing that I thought of for the

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.340 
final thing that I thought of for the
off<00:04:17.100> road<00:04:17.250> update<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.880> manual<00:04:18.630> transmission

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
off road update is manual transmission

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.469 
off road update is manual transmission
and<00:04:19.530> also<00:04:19.890> possibly<00:04:20.400> high<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.000> low<00:04:21.180> gear

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
and also possibly high in low gear

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.630 
and also possibly high in low gear
before<00:04:21.720> grand<00:04:22.380> theft<00:04:22.500> auto<00:04:22.710> 5<00:04:22.950> came<00:04:23.280> out<00:04:23.430> I

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
before grand theft auto 5 came out I

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.310 
before grand theft auto 5 came out I
kind<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.030> thought<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.210> we<00:04:24.450> might<00:04:24.660> see<00:04:24.900> manual

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
kind of thought that we might see manual

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.480 
kind of thought that we might see manual
transmission<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:26.010> an<00:04:26.130> option

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
transmission as an option

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.339 
transmission as an option
either<00:04:26.819> you<00:04:27.150> know<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.419> choose<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.900> or<00:04:28.050> maybe

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
either you know we choose it or maybe

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.689 
either you know we choose it or maybe
some<00:04:28.620> vehicles<00:04:28.979> would<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.310> force<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.639> to

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
some vehicles would just force you to

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.460 
some vehicles would just force you to
use<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:30.090> maybe<00:04:30.300> some<00:04:30.539> older<00:04:30.870> trucks<00:04:31.229> and

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
use it maybe some older trucks and

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.180 
use it maybe some older trucks and
things<00:04:31.560> like<00:04:31.770> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
things like that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.320 
things like that
and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.580> thought<00:04:32.699> that<00:04:32.759> there<00:04:33.030> might<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.210> a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
and I thought that there might be a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.730 
and I thought that there might be a
button<00:04:33.660> on<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> controller<00:04:34.289> that<00:04:34.650> would

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
button on the controller that would

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.140 
button on the controller that would
allow<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.220> either<00:04:35.370> up<00:04:35.669> shift<00:04:35.940> or

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
allow you to either up shift or

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.040 
allow you to either up shift or
downshift

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
downshift

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.930 
downshift
I<00:04:37.080> was<00:04:37.650> really<00:04:37.800> excited<00:04:38.190> about<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.729> think

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I was really excited about that I think

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.400 
I was really excited about that I think
that<00:04:39.030> would've<00:04:39.180> been<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.419> great<00:04:39.690> addition<00:04:39.960> it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
that would've been a great addition it

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.779 
that would've been a great addition it
would<00:04:40.530> have<00:04:40.620> given<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.949> a<00:04:40.979> little<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.490> more

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
would have given you a little bit more

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.029 
would have given you a little bit more
control<00:04:42.750> over<00:04:42.780> your<00:04:43.110> vehicle<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.830> things

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
control over your vehicle and things

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.610 
control over your vehicle and things
like<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:45.630> don't<00:04:46.080> know<00:04:46.139> I'm<00:04:46.319> a<00:04:46.560> little

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
like that and I don't know I'm a little

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.020 
like that and I don't know I'm a little
disappointed<00:04:47.069> that<00:04:47.370> they<00:04:47.580> didn't<00:04:47.880> add<00:04:48.000> it

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
disappointed that they didn't add it

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.670 
disappointed that they didn't add it
because<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.509> played<00:04:48.720> racing<00:04:49.110> games<00:04:49.319> with<00:04:49.530> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
because I played racing games with it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.469 
because I played racing games with it
before<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.220> really<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.120> fun<00:04:51.300> mechanic

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
before and really it's a fun mechanic

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.689 
before and really it's a fun mechanic
especially<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.410> all<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.650> car<00:04:52.889> enthusiasts

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
especially to all you car enthusiasts

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.070 
especially to all you car enthusiasts
and<00:04:53.849> people<00:04:54.090> who<00:04:54.180> like<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.360> drift<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.990> all

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and people who like to drift and all

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.540 
and people who like to drift and all
that<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.620> think<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.250> would<00:04:56.340> be<00:04:56.370> really

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
that I think that would be really

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.279 
that I think that would be really
awesome<00:04:56.819> so<00:04:57.539> for<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.840> off-roading

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
awesome so for the off-roading

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.200 
awesome so for the off-roading
environment<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.280> know<00:04:59.400> climbing<00:05:00.060> some

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
environment you know climbing some

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.670 
environment you know climbing some
really<00:05:00.389> steep<00:05:00.569> hills<00:05:00.810> obviously<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.500> want<00:05:01.650> to

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
really steep hills obviously you want to

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.350 
really steep hills obviously you want to
be<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:01.949> low<00:05:02.130> gear<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:02.759> then<00:05:03.030> let's<00:05:03.240> say

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
be in a low gear and then let's say

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.640 
be in a low gear and then let's say
you're<00:05:03.479> on<00:05:03.509> more<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.930> flat<00:05:04.139> part<00:05:04.409> then<00:05:04.620> you

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
you're on more of a flat part then you

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.529 
you're on more of a flat part then you
can<00:05:04.919> shift<00:05:05.159> up<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.460> few<00:05:05.610> gears<00:05:05.849> into<00:05:06.270> something

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
can shift up a few gears into something

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.240 
can shift up a few gears into something
a<00:05:06.599> little<00:05:06.810> bit<00:05:06.930> higher<00:05:07.139> but<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:07.949> get<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.220> idea

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
a little bit higher but you get the idea

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.770 
a little bit higher but you get the idea
I<00:05:08.610> think<00:05:08.819> that<00:05:08.909> would<00:05:09.000> add<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> lot<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.569> freedom

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
I think that would add a lot of freedom

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.930 
I think that would add a lot of freedom
and<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.289> lot<00:05:10.470> more<00:05:10.680> control<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.520> more<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.849> a

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
and a lot more control and more of a

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.850 
and a lot more control and more of a
realistic<00:05:12.389> feel<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.080> think<00:05:13.409> that'd<00:05:13.710> be<00:05:13.740> a

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
realistic feel and I think that'd be a

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.620 
realistic feel and I think that'd be a
great<00:05:14.130> addition<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.639> the<00:05:14.819> off-roading<00:05:15.360> and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
great addition to the off-roading and

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.439 
great addition to the off-roading and
then<00:05:16.020> like<00:05:16.199> I<00:05:16.289> said<00:05:16.500> high<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.039> low<00:05:17.190> gear<00:05:17.490> there

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
then like I said high and low gear there

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.180 
then like I said high and low gear there
aren't<00:05:18.720> many<00:05:18.960> things<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:19.440> haul<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.919> Grand

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
aren't many things to haul in Grand

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.010 
aren't many things to haul in Grand
Theft<00:05:20.340> Auto<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.090> don't<00:05:21.389> know<00:05:21.479> that's<00:05:21.659> not<00:05:21.810> as

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
Theft Auto so I don't know that's not as

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.480 
Theft Auto so I don't know that's not as
big<00:05:22.440> but<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:22.830> still<00:05:22.949> something<00:05:23.159> that<00:05:23.370> I

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
big but it's still something that I

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.040 
big but it's still something that I
thought<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:24.030> could<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.180> cool<00:05:24.449> you<00:05:24.930> know

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
thought of that could be cool you know

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.570 
thought of that could be cool you know
whether<00:05:25.229> you're<00:05:25.500> hauling<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.919> trailer<00:05:26.069> or<00:05:26.550> I

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
whether you're hauling a trailer or I

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.460 
whether you're hauling a trailer or I
don't<00:05:26.909> know<00:05:27.060> maybe<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.539> giant<00:05:27.990> orange<00:05:28.139> ball

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
don't know maybe the giant orange ball

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.290 
don't know maybe the giant orange ball
like<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.889> did<00:05:29.099> a<00:05:29.280> high<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.759> low<00:05:29.880> gear<00:05:30.090> would

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
like I did a high and low gear would

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.820 
like I did a high and low gear would
once<00:05:30.570> again<00:05:30.750> just<00:05:31.139> be<00:05:31.259> a<00:05:31.289> little<00:05:31.500> bit<00:05:31.620> more

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
once again just be a little bit more

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.950 
once again just be a little bit more
detail<00:05:32.219> a<00:05:32.250> little<00:05:32.669> bit<00:05:32.820> more<00:05:33.000> control<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.780> a

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
detail a little bit more control and a

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.050 
detail a little bit more control and a
little<00:05:34.229> bit<00:05:34.409> more<00:05:34.620> freedom<00:05:35.009> in<00:05:35.280> customization

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
little bit more freedom in customization

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.999 
little bit more freedom in customization
so<00:05:36.389> that<00:05:37.169> pretty<00:05:37.320> much<00:05:37.380> wraps<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.770> up<00:05:37.830> we're

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
so that pretty much wraps it up we're

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.709 
so that pretty much wraps it up we're
already<00:05:38.219> at<00:05:38.430> like<00:05:38.729> five<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.360> half<00:05:39.389> minutes

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
already at like five and a half minutes

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:40.999 
already at like five and a half minutes
on<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:39.930> video<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:40.349> I<00:05:40.380> don't<00:05:40.590> want<00:05:40.710> this<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.919> be

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
on this video so I don't want this to be

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.040 
on this video so I don't want this to be
too<00:05:41.130> long<00:05:41.310> if<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:41.909> missed<00:05:42.210> anything<00:05:42.479> if<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.900> can

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
too long if I missed anything if you can

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.110 
too long if I missed anything if you can
think<00:05:43.229> of<00:05:43.349> any<00:05:43.590> other<00:05:43.710> off-road<00:05:44.400> upgrade<00:05:44.940> that

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
think of any other off-road upgrade that

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.370 
think of any other off-road upgrade that
would<00:05:45.240> be<00:05:45.330> cool<00:05:45.539> in<00:05:45.780> Grand<00:05:46.080> Theft<00:05:46.139> Auto

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380
