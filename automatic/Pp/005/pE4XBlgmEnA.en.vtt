not first or second-round materi that's
exactly<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.819> point<00:03:23.970> let's<00:03:24.269> say<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.510> think

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
exactly the point let's say you think

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.849 
exactly the point let's say you think
that<00:03:25.049> he's<00:03:25.229> going<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.409> be<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.680> best

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
that he's going to be the best

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.680 
that he's going to be the best
quarterback<00:03:26.370> at<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.609> end<00:03:26.729> of<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.909> season<00:03:27.090> so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
quarterback at the end of the season so

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.110 
quarterback at the end of the season so
you<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:28.199> to<00:03:28.440> have<00:03:28.620> him<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.979> respect<00:03:29.819> that<00:03:29.909> and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
you have to have him I respect that and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.509 
you have to have him I respect that and
I'm<00:03:30.239> fine<00:03:30.510> with<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.750> however<00:03:31.739> when<00:03:32.340> he's

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
I'm fine with that however when he's

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.059 
I'm fine with that however when he's
being<00:03:32.760> drafted<00:03:33.209> his<00:03:34.049> draft<00:03:34.470> position<00:03:34.680> right

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
being drafted his draft position right

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.360 
being drafted his draft position right
now<00:03:35.099> on<00:03:35.430> ESPN<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.239> look<00:03:36.419> at<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.979> 108<00:03:37.979> an

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
now on ESPN as I look at is 108 an

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.849 
now on ESPN as I look at is 108 an
overall<00:03:39.269> average<00:03:39.540> draft<00:03:40.019> position<00:03:40.229> so

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
overall average draft position so

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.129 
overall average draft position so
drafting<00:03:41.310> him<00:03:41.430> anywhere<00:03:42.000> else<00:03:42.329> before<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
drafting him anywhere else before the

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.710 
drafting him anywhere else before the
seventh<00:03:43.470> round<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:44.040> foolish<00:03:44.849> that's<00:03:45.180> right<00:03:45.389> in

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
seventh round is foolish that's right in

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.719 
seventh round is foolish that's right in
a<00:03:45.840> 12-man<00:03:46.319> league<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.889> end<00:03:47.129> of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> seventh

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
a 12-man league the end of the seventh

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.030 
a 12-man league the end of the seventh
round<00:03:47.879> is<00:03:48.090> 84<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.199> can<00:03:49.470> grab<00:03:49.680> them<00:03:49.889> in<00:03:49.979> the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
round is 84 so you can grab them in the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.800 
round is 84 so you can grab them in the
seventh<00:03:50.430> round<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.849> be<00:03:51.060> comfortable<00:03:51.599> that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
seventh round and be comfortable that

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 
seventh round and be comfortable that
you're<00:03:51.959> going<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.169> get<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.470> guy<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.680> want<00:03:53.099> and

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.369 
getting them in the second or third one
and<00:03:56.939> think<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.599> guys<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.049> could<00:03:58.169> put

Ryan however we do think that at the
position<00:05:15.750> where<00:05:15.810> he's<00:05:15.960> being<00:05:16.050> drafted<00:05:16.430> 120<00:05:17.430> he

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
position where he's being drafted 120 he

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.080 
position where he's being drafted 120 he
makes<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.450> fantastic<00:05:19.100> quarterback<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.370> for<00:05:20.970> you

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.390 
and needed and I think plastic was going
to<00:05:42.420> do<00:05:42.510> fine<00:05:42.720> he's<00:05:42.990> currently<00:05:43.410> going<00:05:43.650> about<00:05:44.340> a

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
to do fine he's currently going about a

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.240 
to do fine he's currently going about a
hundred<00:05:44.840> ninety<00:05:45.840> three<00:05:46.110> is<00:05:46.620> where<00:05:46.860> he's<00:05:46.980> going

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
hundred ninety three is where he's going

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.040 
hundred ninety three is where he's going
on<00:05:47.340> most<00:05:47.520> ESPN<00:05:48.030> leagues<00:05:48.210> I<00:05:48.360> think<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:48.900> can

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
on most ESPN leagues I think you can

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.960 
on most ESPN leagues I think you can
grab<00:05:49.230> him<00:05:49.410> a<00:05:49.530> few<00:05:49.860> spots<00:05:50.130> before<00:05:50.340> that<00:05:50.670> okay<00:05:50.940> I
