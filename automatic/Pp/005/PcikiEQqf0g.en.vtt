00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 today 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.980
 you continue in z I had in the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.300
 screens of place zaragoza we have a 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.490
 hour ahead to talk about football 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.080
 from this strange situation that we live 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.029
 with the real zaragoza out of the squares 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.380
 of promotion with the first defeat in 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.000
 let's analyze it, but before 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560
 we want to give our particular tribute 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300
 a player who three years ago 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.039
 now that he began to live a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.350
 Calvary, I say we do not talk 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.059
 We are talking about Cesar Jimenez who 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.460
 right now it is linked to the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.500
 subsidiaries of the real zaragoza but that makes 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.879
 two years at the stadium three years ago 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.640
 rather a santiago bernabéu stadium 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.260
 an entry by luis figo withdrew him from 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 the soccer fields forever 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 after two years of rehabilitation his 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.440
 knee said enough and could not return to a 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.149
 soccer field this is our 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.149
 particular tribute to Cesar Jimenez 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.460
 it was a month of January like this though 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.500
 everything then was very different 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.589
 the real zaragoza was in first 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.019
 division and that January 16, 2005 it 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.580
 surrendered visit to bernabéu have passed 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.740
 three years from the day on which the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.700
 misfortune was crossed in the life of a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 soccer player 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 Cesar Jimenez was the saw the misfortune of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 who blows my knee in the knee and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 I go forward him back and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 was when I knee if you remove and if 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 pilla more down above maybe louis 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.690
 and it hit and it went out without more and good 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.380
 unfortunately it happened and you no longer give 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.899
 more laps 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.690
 no I do not know I do not know if it whistled annoying lack yo 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.179
 I say I was already annoyed and not 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.369
 I tried to put myself in the band trying 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.130
 stand up clear in the opportunity and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.840
 could not even put something 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 serious had that was the end of a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.740
 career that was trading on the rise 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 Cesar Jimenez was precisely a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.789
 product of the white quarry of the hand 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.659
 from manolo villanova settled down in the real 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.239
 Zaragoza in 1998 debuted in 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.890
 first in the 2000 season 2001 in a 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.290
 zaragoza 4 osasuna 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.159
 in which he marked precisely his only 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 goal in first 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.920
 it was precisely the lack 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.990
 lateral to the side of the corner near the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.040
 benches a side fault he jumped 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 the wedge as it centers and we will enter late 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.530
 from outside the area and jump and topped 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 practically only because they were 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.100
 practically yes marking and between 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.110
 practically from behind only the auction and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.360
 it was the first goal we're going to start the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 party and especially the conquest that you 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 must begin to debut and commit a goal 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.980
 the least they know is that as a child and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.750
 It was central nor was it from Madrid 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.400
 midcentury in fact the section of 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.310
 castellón when today with 14 and 15 years old 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.430
 it was to his fifteen web of mediapunta 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.810
 we play with another xavi me behind and good 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.269
 and little by little when you grow up you 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.910
 is delaying when you get to Madrid and everything 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.050
 that's because it's been a couple of years and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.050
 the third division will arrive already 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 I always the boat always from 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.540
 small as in the neighborhood we were a 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.970
 group of friends always from the bazaar and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.530
 He made when he signed with the Madrid 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.379
 that they take me there, we comment that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.439
 this player of the club that will change for 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:15.030
 typical from small after 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.189
 first success in zaragoza was the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.980
 achievement of the cup of the king of 2001 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.420
 Cesar did not play that game but he remembers 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.450
 how was the celebration with their 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.389
 comrades the final in the field of 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.280
 Olympic and good to be there and to 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.799
 get a drink from the king was not all 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.590
 was in favor of víctor fernández in the 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.319
 Celtic then 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.319
 and they started winning them and start 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.680
 go up the game and take the cup is 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.030
 something wonderful 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.860
 but his path in zaragoza had 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.739
 also a walk in the south of the 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.049
 2002 season to 2004 destination 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.000
 football led to Cesar Jimenez up 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.190
 almeria there coincided with a good 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.019
 batch of footballers was a starter and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.599
 he knocked on the door of zaragoza 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.239
 and in 2004 he was a substitute in the victory in 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.160
 the supercopa was in valencia that was 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.829
 Midweek how to play during the week 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.420
 the league match was maybe less 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.360
 because you have to talk to him next 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.720
 zaragoza I have to go you have a 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.639
 next different way perhaps the cup 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.190
 of the king then something like something final 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.019
 of the season so something better but 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.090
 good are two things that are in the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.100
 I remember a way back to the ebro that 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.470
 ended in injury after entry 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.570
 de figo Cesar Jimenez tried everything to 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.669
 returning to the competition was two 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.130
 years of recovery a calvary that 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.750
 included four operations his knee 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.720
 it was never the same had a 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.580
 total instability 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.920
 that if the squirrel is well is cured 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.540
 it's fine but to make the turns for 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.400
 do all kinds of exercises that there are in 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.380
 football is complicated is not only 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.710
 the mail then there is a game of 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.430
 knee that makes me swell 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.920
 stop 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.320
 and well there was something that did not work 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.970
 when in a clear turn only again and 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.100
 That's when I injured him again 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.080
 crossed but life in those moments 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.520
 complicated they also teach you to come back to 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.320
 relapse again and think again about what 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.270
 same what had happened 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.910
 it's difficult again and logically it's 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 complicated to be there again but good 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.630
 there we follow initiatory as michel was 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.370
 the sportingly speaking in asia 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.650
 sporting and throwing many hours for 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.390
 morning crush of are many hours of 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.420
 long and good and try to go back to 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.300
 try it on March 14, 2007 cesar 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.370
 jimenez announced his retirement had 30 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.730
 years and all his colleagues wanted 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.290
 be next to him say goodbye to football 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.020
 in the company shares with the 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.060
 because it was a formative one and not 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.860
 soon also soon the companions I 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.730
 I did not know anything not at a press conference 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.490
 presented by peers 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.050
 training and there was something to the potential 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.800
 something motive that will always remain there and 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.940
 then the day of romanity the tribute 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.040
 the opportunity to say goodbye 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.500
 the average team where he left the 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.330
 opportunity is something that will always remain 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.280
 There, the ex-footballer now trains 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.560
 kids the team pearls 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.100
 tile to instill love for 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.040
 football 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.030
 santi aragón who was also the player 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.890
 they say they are going to open the foundation not 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.690
 football school and that I still do not 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.409
 I knew if I was going to continue from here I was going to 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.689
 march ávila 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.279
 and well I decided I talk to him and 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.319
 I decide therefore that to continue with 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:20.319
 wrestlers I have done the courses of 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.969
 coaches and why not follow here from 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.119
 Zaragoza at least these years and continue 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.499
 linked to the team and it's that way 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:28.809
 continued here the school the children you know 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.899
 it's a wonder it's not very rewarding 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:34.469
 train with the kids and we need 

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:37.769
 every afternoon to go for them 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.769
 trying so 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.740
 teach them and try to learn the 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.270
 things that we have and that 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.639
 have fun and learn to always be 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.740
 there are always always players and always 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.000
 you know, you know and it's important that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.400
 everything as blacksmith as bonnie are there 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.560
 for those who are down there was not only one 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.699
 foundation in grassroots football and that is a 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.540
 incentive for them to follow 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:01.940
 working 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.889
 César Jiménez is now 31 years old 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.870
 knee could not compete anymore but there's 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.850
 something that will never break your 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.130
 ligament of union to a passion the 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.360
 football and some colors those of the real 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.349
 Saragossa 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.569
 but here already two years make the withdrawal 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.810
 and in fact, because here we are still very 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.810
 taste 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.030
 is here a hug to Cesar Jimenez a 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.350
 fighter who is teaching so 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.610
 he likes football but we have 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.290
 have some problem hooks us 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.620
 little bit at the end the video we received 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.620
 apologies
