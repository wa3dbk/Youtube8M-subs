00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.879
 I greet you friends in the next part 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.160
 dedicated to master promar fix and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.179
 as I promised in this part we are from 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 cross go directly to the corners 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.520
 the bottom layer remind what to keep on 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.180
 cross to the bottom 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 the bottom layer we have consists of four more 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.250
 angles and these are angles which contain three 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.099
 colors and angles that contain one color 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.780
 given to hear for example here we have the right 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.770
 layer and here here we have to put 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 a corner that can do one color 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.420
 it turned out that we have this angle from 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.899
 is right here put on his 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 between 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.300
 and since it is absolutely the same color 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.329
 we do n't care how we put it on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.949
 this stage does not matter to us 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.789
 simple 3 moves. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:08.340
 you are a stroke we ourselves are driving it to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.350
 place the next item we need 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 whether we put it here 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 here what colors does it consist of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.610
 defined by the center here is yellow here 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.460
 green and here blue means we need 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.200
 corner containing yellow green and blue 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.700
 colors are looking for it 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 This is clearly not he This is not he, but it's as bad 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.380
 we move it here very much 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.200
 just because it already stands in the bottom 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.220
 layer we have to reach up again 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.850
 simple three moves cru 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.170
 h3 set it up and see how 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 us his 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.430
 left many people in general kills 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 This question is how to put an angle because 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.250
 that she's trying to recover everything 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.850
 equals he somehow 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 wrong 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.740
 and it's very simple the fact is that to us 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.479
 need to 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.520
 look where we have a coincidence 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.119
 colors again just like the cube and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.020
 If we 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.610
 if you are correct and remember yes angle can 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.069
 positioned so we have 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.800
 match either front or left 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.950
 but this is again either 3 hodovka or 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.970
 here either 3 hodovka left vodka that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.180
 here we are absolutely the same look 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.319
 here 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.030
 coincided with the center did not coincide about and here it is 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.880
 matched in color with our center this 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.440
 We will have 3 hodovka left to do as much 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.340
 three 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 only three h3 is wonderful we have an angle 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.720
 it was put absolutely right how are you 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.049
 we need yes if 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:57.400
 if we had such an option that 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:59.440
 nothing matched us ha today 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.299
 Saparov here as now for example not here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.640
 not here then we should just deploy 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.340
 this angle means doing the following 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.620
 way 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.620
 south 2 r-bar 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.340
 only three and we see that we have coincided with 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.090
 center right then do 3 hodovka 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.079
 you are three 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.609
 what we have collected at this stage we 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.780
 at this stage on the collected 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.420
 great we continue here what's here 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.340
 we have red triangles yes a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.819
 we need green here right 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 right 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.560
 look for him and find that he is here 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.950
 here we put on our nest on our slot 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.930
 so he is a simple 3 hodovka and drive on 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.130
 your place 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.130
 let's go h3 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.019
 the next corner of what it is worth 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.750
 green yellow red means we need 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.480
 corner containing yellow red and green 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.440
 color here it is right before our eyes 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.830
 We look where we match the colors here are not 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.200
 matched matched here means we 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.060
 you install it a simple three 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.630
 cru moves 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.859
 h3 and we see that the corner has stopped 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.110
 absolutely true so friends we 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.240
 themselves have collected completely the first layer 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.900
 master pen Morse see all 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.050
 we have the first layer ready at this stage 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.669
 we no longer care about ours 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.479
 the next video we'll get down to 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.840
 assembly layer 2 wizard promar fix to 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.840
 meeting
