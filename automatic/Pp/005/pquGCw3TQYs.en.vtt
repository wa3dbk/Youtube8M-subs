00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello everyone once again following 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.900
 your suggestions I am ready to make 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.490
 a test of the pcp emulator in the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.730
 motor or motorcycle gp 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.520
 to see if this terminal is what 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 powerful enough to move 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.970
 this application then in this case the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.009
 emulator to use 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.009
 is the one to see if I find it around here 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.700
 here is the pp ssp name something 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.040
 complicated 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.870
 and to execute it you just have to 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.270
 install it play store 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 add your images of the games 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.370
 in any directory on the card 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.040
 memory or in this case memory 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.100
 internal and the emulator itself, because 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.640
 recognizes then I for this test I have 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.880
 added the final fantasy 7 which is one of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.450
 my favorite games of the first 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.800
 playstation and then the burnout and good 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.409
 let's do a test to see how 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.509
 behaves let's start with the most 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.229
 demanding in this case is the end 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.229
 fantasy 7 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.229
 well we see that it loads completely fast 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.540
 and here we start to see that the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.250
 introduction 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.250
 goes a little bit to the jumps 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 to see you can see 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.219
 but it's not going as smooth as it should go 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.789
 so let's see if we can jump 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.789
 this introduction 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.640
 and we give a new game 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 and there it begins 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.390
 well we can see that the buttons on 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.540
 screen practically occupy the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.200
 entirety of the surface then what 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.560
 ideal would be to use a command 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.650
 bluetooth 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.660
 more afterwards it looks but good to do 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.530
 the test we are going to use these 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.900
 controls on the screen 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.170
 we see that the introduction of the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.170
 game 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.950
 and again then jumps 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.709
 let's see if I can jump the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.069
 well, it seems 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.819
 you have to see it completely then 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.250
 let's leave it here and once finished 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.849
 I come back like the good video because it has already 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 finished the introduction so 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.280
 start the game let's see how 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.280
 such answer 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.420
 Well the truth is that it is more fluid 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 what I thought 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.959
 the graphics that yes no 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.959
 I do not think they are 100% 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.550
 but I'm really surprised because 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.550
 it's pretty fluid 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.140
 Well the truth is that 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.140
 I had not played this version 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.219
 so you have to apologize that it 's the 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.219
 I'm really bad 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 so we can move forward 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.720
 Well, the first impression is that 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.730
 It has surprised me 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.730
 I kept pretty fluid 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.510
 well let's leave this test here 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.700
 I have another game 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.290
 to prove it's the embroidery so 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.080
 I'm going to get out of here and we're going to do the 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.419
 new test 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.220
 Well, I'm talking principal and 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.370
 let's try burnout to see how 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.370
 it behaves 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.870
 again the videos seem to cost you 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.590
 that goes as more assault I do not know if it is 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.280
 hardware issue or if it's a problem 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:16.730
 of optimization of the emulator then 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.730
 the truth that I could not say we're going 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.969
 to load profile that I had done with 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.969
 anteriority 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.850
 so 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.690
 in a fast arcade mode to see how 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.690
 answer back 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.610
 and we started 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.110
 good looks 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.910
 you do not go completely fluid I do not know if what 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.100
 you appreciate well in the video but it goes like 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.100
 assaults say no 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.919
 does not transmit the feeling of 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.580
 speed that you can have at the time of 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.580
 play on the psp 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.680
 the truth is that the first impression is 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.650
 that the game well 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.009
 and without playable is to say no the truth is not 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.960
 worth it 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.300
 play this game as the emulator and 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.360
 even more so having the games 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.509
 available in the play store games 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.509
 careers 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.500
 and well let's leave it here 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.270
 and nothing like always if you have any 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.339
 another question then leave me your
