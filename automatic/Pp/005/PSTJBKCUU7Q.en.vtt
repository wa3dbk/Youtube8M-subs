00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 now 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.570
 the home 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.450
 I am Maria Cecilia Konell, advisor to the Pastoral Episcopal Commission for 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.890
 cnbb biblical-catechetical animation 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.360
 I invite you to take a walk the 1st Brazilian Congress of 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.699
 pastoral animation 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 the walk that begins this month of October 2010 will have its high point 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.179
 from October 8 to 12, 2001 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.470
 because it is a congress of biblical animation of the pastoral 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.880
 because since the 5th General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.340
 caribe that will happen in appeared in paulo in 2007 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.490
 the Bishops call for our biblical ministry 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.780
 andrÃ© feel so rich so active since Vatican second in the church in the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.630
 Brazil 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.870
 become the sister animation of the whole pastoral 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 but what a difference in that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.720
 the biblical pastoral that prevailed since the Vatican Council 2nd without messi does 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.160
 a great good return in Brazil and assumes the main function 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.030
 is to fulfill what is required by the dogmatic constitution of the verbum 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.230
 all the faithful have access to sacred scripture 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.160
 in this point 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.690
 the church in Brazil is privileged with its various translations of the bible and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.260
 how many institutions and organizations working with 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.940
 Bible 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.370
 such as the following Sat 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.130
 many other initiatives that privilege the word of God as the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.619
 reading prayer and the biblical circles family groups 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.200
 to catechesis 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.320
 However 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.320
 invited and invited to transform this biblical 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.760
 present so far 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 in Italy but did not succeed in pastoral care 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.260
 and here is the difference 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.890
 it's no longer an action that takes care of the bible 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.240
 like pastoral care for young people in the catechesis of the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.270
 families 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.530
 and it is not enough that people have access to sacred scriptures and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.399
 a good initiation into life 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740
 it is necessary that comes 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.930
 all in the past church the word of god 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.340
 the word of God without spirit that is based 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 then the word of God without food 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.159
 the word of God must be the soul of every pastoral of all the action of the 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.259
 church 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.499
 the bible should not be an option over the whole of the tree 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.300
 but the landing that run through the whole trunk 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
 the life fair explained to take 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.399
 this meal 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.729
 is already happening in many dioceses and regional cnbb 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.559
 including with the creation of biblical animation commissions of the pastoral 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.719
 and to further assist this process in this new way of understanding should 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.459
 honor the word of god 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.659
 we are offering to you 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.159

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.819

 biblical-catechetical and in partnership with 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.369
 if society emphasizes that the Latin American cup 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.969
 So it's me and you to walk together occupy the 1st 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.969

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.120
 will be a privileged moment of a synthesis evaluates city 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.609
 all this process started at the 5th conference 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.230
