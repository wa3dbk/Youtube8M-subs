00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.940
Let's now focus onto the dynamic warm-up.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.830
Spvgg. Unterhaching represents modern football,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.059
warming up should be as modern as well.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.759
The exercises are called "Movement Preps",

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.590
which prepare us for the actual game itself.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.720
That's why we here don't want to use static

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.340
but dynamic motions to raise our body temperature,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.980
as well as to activate our neurological muscles

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.780
while preparing ourselves for movements in
our sport

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.980
at the same time.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.230
Let's start with the "Handwalk".

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.670
We start off with our legs parallel to each
other,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.520
now we move our fingers to the ground,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.500
Leon moves his fingers forward,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.110
makes sure his knees stay extended

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.680
so that his hamstring muscles

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.640
are being stretched dynamically.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.680
He peforms a push-up to put pressure on his
body

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.680
and then moves back towards his arms with
his feet.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.000
Avoid too much swinging in the center of your
body.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This could be caused by a lack of activity
in the core muscles,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.070
or by bending your knees,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.640
which is caused

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.240
by a lack of mobility

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.240
in the hamstring muscles.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.409
This activates the hamstring

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.479
and core muscles, ankles

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.680
and the supporting muscle groups of the upper
body at the same time.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.680
The 
next dynamic warm-up routine

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.740
is called the "forward Lunge"

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.780
with a rotation of the thoracic spine.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.360
we start off again with our legs parallel
to each other,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.470
forward lunge,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.759
move both arms down to the lead leg,

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.070
move the thoracic spine up,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.810
keep looking at the hand,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.039
back down, turn to the other side,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.440
move both arms up,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.090
and get up again.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.739
This improves the strength of the leg's axis

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.819
preparing it for possible movements during
the game,

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.660
while mobilizing the upper body,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.660
and actively stretching our hip and hamstring
muscles at the same time.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.120
6 to 8 forward lunge reps.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.650
Make sure the lead leg remains in a straight
line,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.650
and not to move it sideways.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.550
The next exercise is the dynamic sideways
lunge

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.700
pushing back into the starting position.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.540
It prepares players for sideways movements
during the game.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.739
Lift your leg up high, sideways lunge,

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.410
standing leg remains extended, now push back
dynamically into the starting position.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.340
This creates an active stretching of the adductor
muscles,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.790
as well as improving its strength.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.980
Make sure you upper body is upright,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.900
don't bend it forward,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.890
so that the leg muscles are working actively.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.890
6 to 8 reps on each side.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.909
Well done.

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:46.909
Head and upper body is straight.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.489
The next exercise especially activates the
muscles in the hip region.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.150
Hip flexor, glutes, thigh and hamstring muscles,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.720
we start off

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.400
by actively bringing our leg up,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.330
here it's important to activate the glutes
of the standing leg,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.959
grab your foot, then stretch the thigh,

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.909
while lowering the upper body simultaneously,

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.000
move down and up again.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.049
While the muscles are being actively stretched,

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.859
the ankles are also being stabilized,

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.859
which prepares players for possible poor pitch
conditions.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.949
It also brings into effect

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.689
the psychological factor,

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.830
of having the player to be very concentrated

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.400
and fully focused during this exercise.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.400
4 to 6 reps on each side.

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.479
We perform these "Neuro-Skippings"

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.419
before each game,

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:16.080
to neuromuscularily prepare the players for
quick motions and movements.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.580
We start off in a half squat,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.800
move our center of gravity forward, put pressure
just on the balls of the feet,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.499
The player now

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.039
quickly moves up and down on the balls of
his feet.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.289
Keep it going for three seconds then stop.

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.039
Relax for 30 seconds, 3 to 5 reps.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.399
Move out your upper body, chest straight,

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.459
forward your center of gravity, and quickly
move up and down.
