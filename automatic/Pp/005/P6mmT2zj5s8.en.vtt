00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.940
 description that the style itself offers 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.280
 and now let's talk about what 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.580
 really interested in this video the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.820
 game guess for this month your date of 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.700
 launch was on February 12 , 2008 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.670
 and now you can play from the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.570
 following playstation 2 platforms and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.350
 wii xbox 360 does not have a mode 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.520
 multiplayer the game is adventure and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.690
 of action is based on a movie me 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.640
 I think you have data here 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.700
 enough to make a slight idea 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.820
 If you do not find out what the game is 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 will be for next month and then the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.539
 winner instead of a game will take 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 two but good that is another subject 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.630
 now I beg you if you want to participate 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 participate do it because it's free 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.490
 no new costs nothing and good who knows 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.440
 you can win that you have an idea 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.560
 a little bit far from what can be 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 it is better to use the one that best wins if all 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.860
 so go forward a lot of luck to 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.590
 I hope you like this one 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.270

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.270
