can<00:00:19.450> you<00:00:19.540> tell<00:00:19.780> me<00:00:19.900> if<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.080> can<00:00:20.230> think<00:00:20.410> of<00:00:20.530> some

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
can you tell me if you can think of some

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.940 
can you tell me if you can think of some
pieces<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.250> use<00:00:21.490> parallel<00:00:22.360> chords<00:00:23.080> Thanks

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
pieces that use parallel chords Thanks

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.220 
pieces that use parallel chords Thanks
parallel<00:00:24.610> chords<00:00:25.030> well<00:00:25.210> you<00:00:25.360> know<00:00:25.450> as<00:00:25.840> soon<00:00:26.110> as

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
parallel chords well you know as soon as

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.570 
parallel chords well you know as soon as
you<00:00:26.289> mentioned<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:27.010> first<00:00:27.310> thing<00:00:27.430> that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
you mentioned that the first thing that

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.910 
you mentioned that the first thing that
popped<00:00:27.789> into<00:00:27.940> my<00:00:28.090> head<00:00:28.120> was<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> Sarabande

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
popped into my head was the Sarabande

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.220 
popped into my head was the Sarabande
from<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.789> portlet<00:00:31.390> piano<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.930> second

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
from the portlet piano the second

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.510 
from the portlet piano the second
movement<00:00:32.379> of<00:00:32.590> Portland<00:00:32.920> piano<00:00:33.100> by<00:00:33.250> Claude

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
movement of Portland piano by Claude

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.880 
movement of Portland piano by Claude
Debussy<00:00:33.699> and<00:00:34.239> yes<00:00:34.930> they're<00:00:35.140> parallel<00:00:35.560> chords

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
Debussy and yes they're parallel chords

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.640 
Debussy and yes they're parallel chords
they're<00:00:36.220> not<00:00:36.400> precisely<00:00:36.970> parallel<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:38.020> they

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
they're not precisely parallel in they

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.400 
they're not precisely parallel in they
have<00:00:38.920> harmonic<00:00:39.310> relevancy<00:00:40.090> but<00:00:40.540> listen<00:00:40.899> to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
have harmonic relevancy but listen to

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.410 
have harmonic relevancy but listen to
the<00:00:41.620> listed<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.640> little<00:00:42.880> bit<00:00:42.970> of<00:00:43.060> this<00:00:43.210> and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
the listed a little bit of this and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.880 
the listed a little bit of this and
you'll<00:00:43.510> see<00:00:43.690> why<00:00:43.870> I<00:00:43.899> thought<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.470> this<00:00:44.620> in

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
you'll see why I thought of this in

00:00:44.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
you'll see why I thought of this in
terms<00:00:45.220> of<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.489> parallel<00:00:45.850> chords

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.040 

and<00:01:03.680> later<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.370> same<00:01:05.550> piece

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.590 

you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:45.040 

you

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.690 

so<00:01:46.050> yes<00:01:46.320> there's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> parallel

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so yes there's a lot of parallel

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.690 
so yes there's a lot of parallel
harmonies<00:01:48.330> going<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:49.010> you<00:01:50.010> know<00:01:50.100> for

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
harmonies going on you know for

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.370 
harmonies going on you know for
something<00:01:50.850> completely<00:01:51.120> different<00:01:51.870> when<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
something completely different when I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.650 
something completely different when I
was<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:53.280> kid<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.520> studied<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:54.210> piece<00:01:54.480> five

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
was a little kid I studied a piece five

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.490 
was a little kid I studied a piece five
octo<00:01:55.320> Bo<00:01:55.730> Octavio<00:01:56.730> Pinto<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.260> called

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
octo Bo Octavio Pinto and it was called

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.070 
octo Bo Octavio Pinto and it was called
run<00:01:58.830> run<00:01:59.160> I've<00:01:59.430> never<00:01:59.850> forgotten<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.510> because

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
run run I've never forgotten it because

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.840 
run run I've never forgotten it because
it<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> whole<00:02:01.800> bunch<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.160> parallel<00:02:02.400> chords

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
it has a whole bunch of parallel chords

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.430 
it has a whole bunch of parallel chords
and<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.270> sounded<00:02:03.690> really<00:02:03.810> hard<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.320> it's

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
and it sounded really hard but it's

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.080 
and it sounded really hard but it's
actually<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:04.920> hard<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.310> play<00:02:05.520> I'm<00:02:05.940> gonna

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
actually not that hard to play I'm gonna

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:24.610 
actually not that hard to play I'm gonna
play<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.840> beginning<00:02:07.080> section<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.440 

you<00:02:25.620> couldn't<00:02:26.010> get<00:02:26.129> much<00:02:26.430> more<00:02:26.670> parallel<00:02:27.269> than

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you couldn't get much more parallel than

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.539 
you couldn't get much more parallel than
that<00:02:27.629> now<00:02:28.049> what<00:02:28.230> makes<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.590> sound<00:02:28.709> hard<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
that now what makes it sound hard is the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.970 
that now what makes it sound hard is the
hands<00:02:30.060> are<00:02:30.209> alternating<00:02:31.079> if<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.620> did<00:02:31.829> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
hands are alternating if I did it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
hands are alternating if I did it
without<00:02:32.129> going<00:02:32.819> back<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.329> forth<00:02:33.540> with<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
without going back and forth with the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:49.610 
without going back and forth with the
hands<00:02:34.019> you'd<00:02:34.260> realize<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.159> this<00:02:48.620> it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
hands you'd realize it's just this it's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500 
hands you'd realize it's just this it's
all<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:50.010> parallel<00:02:50.430> cords<00:02:50.909> just<00:02:51.180> exactly

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
all just parallel cords just exactly

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.179 
all just parallel cords just exactly
what<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> asked<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:52.980> hope<00:02:53.159> that
