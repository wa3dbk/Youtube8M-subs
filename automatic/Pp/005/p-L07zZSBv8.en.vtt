only<00:05:29.310> downside<00:05:29.850> about<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.389> that<00:05:30.660> they<00:05:30.840> are

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
only downside about it is that they are

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.020 
only downside about it is that they are
a<00:05:30.990> little<00:05:31.350> fragile<00:05:31.740> compared<00:05:32.639> to<00:05:32.790> other
