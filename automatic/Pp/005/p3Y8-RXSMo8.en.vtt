00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.790
 scared all the kids are rich for 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.340
 last times between Italy and us 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.340
 surgical the waste player pirlo it in 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.030
 form player who buys a plus 1 of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.530
 overall from 84 passes to 85 is this 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.530
 Juve phenomenon is really a 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.630
 very very good player we talk 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.530
 of its characteristics 94 of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.000
 ball control 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.790
 the ball is always attached to the foot 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.290
 it is really difficult to take it away from him 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.570
 let's say you will see in the clips 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.910
 above all many many 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.680
 passages because the feature 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.670
 absolute best even if one sees 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.210
 the paper realizes are the steps 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.200
 93 on paper that turn into 97 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.909
 long passages boys a value 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.460
 absurd I rarely found the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.290
 player is so good at passing the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.570
 ball on really scared passages 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.540
 wonders every step that long 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.450
 it was dangerous but really yes 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.150
 unmarked the tips I go ahead and have it 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.520
 put a fast tip because it was 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.200
 fantastic spear and the ability to do it 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.650
 always run and score like this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 I hardly understand why 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.600
 many laws where then marked with the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 fast tip didn't count me in 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.200
 statistics I did not understand why 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.210
 honestly, however, I made a mess of 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 launch but you will see yourself in the clips 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.200
 then okay to 94 of courts even to say 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.900
 one is not wrong by chance either 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.150
 short passages and therefore is one 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.330
 absolute characteristic then to 98 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.060
 boys division a value here too 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.100
 mitch key ie practically and man 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.740
 passage so define man 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 pass then we go to talk about everything 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.349
 the rest at 44 speed unfortunately 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.080
 meeting because at 56 re-acceleration 33 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.140
 of maximum speed so you have to understand 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.599
 how slow though you have to calculate 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.980
 that you know how to use it because 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.920
 he is not a player to make you gallop 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.460
 and so the dribbling 84 is also a good one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.830
 value 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.320
 overall, however, he is not a player 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.990
 who knows how to dribble opponents very well 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.990
 it is a little manual, but only 69 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.450
 of agility then has no ski stars 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.790
 sum of these the skill wind is not a 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.190
 player used to dribble 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 I think you will notice it too 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.190
 you tried a feature though 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.440
 excellent balance e 83 of 64 of 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.330
 physical strength but this balancing it 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 I helped a lot because I didn't hear it 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.310
 this low value from physical strength 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.110
 then to 65 of aggression but I don't have 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.910
 understood why the value so low he 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.370
 he went to retrieve a lot of balls 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.350
 and then 69 of interceptions that seemed 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.240
 much more because one recovered 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.370
 lots of balloons and I used it in a 4 3 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.800
 3 ter central cc we say is really me 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.590
 reco was a lot of balloons and oh well 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.470
 every now and then with dripping if I went a little 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.350
 to force me lost some football 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.480
 however using also how to recover 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.390
 balloons amused me a lot I have to 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.070
 tell the truth because he could 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.200
 recover the ball and then restart with the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.320
 its fantastic passages 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.980
 let's say I also used coc 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.110
 but sometimes it didn't excite me anymore 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.220
 much can also do the coc wanting 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.040
 it's for god's sake 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.190
 however I don't open wind either enamel though 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.140
 the 73 shooting is a feature that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.170
 he surprised me a little 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.970
 has a no go by or excuse me 81 power 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.360
 shot that feels really enough 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.610
 strong and then the long shot that 86 is 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.840
 really a very high value and a lot 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.209
 very good in game 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.190
 because he made me crazy long shots 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.530
 really beautiful to see 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.700
 oh well it has only 63 finalization though 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.930
 he is not a player he must 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.970
 finalizing in the end is not 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.950
 an attacker so they didn't enter 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.870
 but he always did more than a few 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.310
 really nice shot that echoed 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.370
 Also excellent stylistically perfect you 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.580
 then I hate the punishment guys 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.889
 curse widened that two points 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.439
 you went and didn't save them though 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.810
 really fantastic errands of 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:37.379
 deadly trajectories and then also i 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.810
 rigors are excellent 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:43.719
 87 really fantastic value more 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.090
 works and medium bass and I must say that it is a 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:48.490
 work at acceptable maybe thaci today 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.039
 you don't always see it in place though 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.629
 as cc and 8 for boys give more we say 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.699
 that ends here you can see these yes 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.740
 pros and cons I gave him a seven and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.050
 half because he deserves it and they feel it 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.900
 upgrade to the version of then the 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.669
 iv version you can take it especially 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.300
 for a top team series if I like them 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.849
 the players with big passes is a nice one 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.379
 long you can take it I hope it is me 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.389
