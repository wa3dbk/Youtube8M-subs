good impact and good range and fire rate
I<00:02:16.819> mean<00:02:17.000> fire<00:02:17.209> rate<00:02:17.390> most<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.810> shotguns

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
don't have a high fire rate that's why I

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.099 
don't have a high fire rate that's why I
like<00:02:19.969> the<00:02:20.120> sword<00:02:20.329> breaker<00:02:20.599> because<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> sword

like the sword breaker because the sword
breaker<00:02:21.500> has<00:02:21.650> really<00:02:21.980> really<00:02:22.219> good<00:02:22.370> fire<00:02:22.609> rate

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
breaker has really really good fire rate

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.750

but at least to if you guys noticed
there's<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:26.000> big<00:02:26.180> difference<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> big<00:02:27.079> big

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
there's a big difference not a big big

difference<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.340> impact<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:28.909> a<00:02:28.969> big<00:02:29.239> one

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
difference on the impact but a big one

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.080 
difference on the impact but a big one
in<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.629> range<00:02:30.129> almost<00:02:31.129> doubling<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.879> range

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
in the range almost doubling the range

in the range almost doubling the range
of<00:02:32.329> her<00:02:32.510> courtesy<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.200> impact<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.159> rates<00:02:34.310> are

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
of her courtesy so impact and rates are

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.099 
of her courtesy so impact and rates are
gonna<00:02:34.579> be<00:02:34.760> very<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.239> key<00:02:35.510> when<00:02:35.720> using<00:02:35.900> a

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.659 
will make a big difference when playing
PvP<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:09.230> know<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.409> looks<00:03:09.739> slightly<00:03:10.069> slightly

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
PvP you know it looks slightly slightly

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.849 
PvP you know it looks slightly slightly
but<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.239> does<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:11.689> a<00:03:11.930> lot<00:03:12.260> lot<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.709> a

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
but it does make a lot lot of a

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.009 
but it does make a lot lot of a
difference<00:03:13.280> when<00:03:13.879> you<00:03:13.909> guys<00:03:14.150> are<00:03:14.329> playing<00:03:14.480> PvP

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
difference when you guys are playing PvP

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.899 
difference when you guys are playing PvP
so<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:15.769> why<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:15.980> party<00:03:16.370> crasher<00:03:16.669> just

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
so that's why the party crasher just

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.670 
so that's why the party crasher just
overtakes<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.599> judgment<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.319> by<00:03:18.500> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
overtakes that judgment just by that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.399 
overtakes that judgment just by that
slight<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.430> mijin<00:03:19.729> of<00:03:19.879> impact<00:03:20.569> in<00:03:20.750> it

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
slight the mijin of impact in it

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.809 
slight the mijin of impact in it
overtakes<00:03:21.979> it<00:03:22.040> as<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.310> guys<00:03:22.400> known<00:03:22.579> as<00:03:22.669> the

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
overtakes it as you guys known as the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.289 
overtakes it as you guys known as the
range<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.739> about<00:03:24.739> it<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.129> almost<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.549> same<00:03:25.760> so

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
range is about it is almost the same so

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.909 
range is about it is almost the same so
the<00:03:26.419> only<00:03:26.599> big<00:03:26.780> difference<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.470> fire<00:03:27.680> rate

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
the only big difference is the fire rate

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.680 
the only big difference is the fire rate
under<00:03:28.129> judgments<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.639> little<00:03:28.849> bit<00:03:28.940> better<00:03:29.060> but

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
under judgments a little bit better but

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.059 
under judgments a little bit better but
you<00:03:29.959> know<00:03:30.049> a<00:03:30.079> fire<00:03:30.379> rate<00:03:30.590> usually<00:03:30.829> than

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
you know a fire rate usually than

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.909 
you know a fire rate usually than
shotguns<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.790> pretty<00:03:32.150> slow<00:03:32.569> but<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.440> impact

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
shotguns is pretty slow but the impact

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.920 
shotguns is pretty slow but the impact
is<00:03:34.069> one<00:03:34.489> manage<00:03:34.849> with<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.239> time<00:03:35.540> around<00:03:35.720> so

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
is one manage with the time around so

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.449 
is one manage with the time around so
party<00:03:36.169> crasher<00:03:36.470> comes<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.919> at<00:03:37.099> number<00:03:37.400> two

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
party crasher has a higher rate of fire

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.969 
party crasher has a higher rate of fire
but<00:03:53.449> if<00:03:53.659> you<00:03:53.810> guys<00:03:53.959> notice<00:03:54.319> the<00:03:54.470> two<00:03:54.739> main

are the two main parts when it comes

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.890 
are the two main parts when it comes
down<00:04:17.509> to<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:19.310> ashati<00:04:19.759> the<00:04:20.150> only<00:04:20.359> thing<00:04:20.539> I<00:04:20.659> wish

down to to ashati the only thing I wish
to<00:04:21.079> manager<00:04:21.530> had<00:04:21.769> was<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.159> same<00:04:22.340> amount<00:04:22.639> of

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
to manager had was the same amount of

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.370 
to manager had was the same amount of
fire<00:04:23.000> rate<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.659> would<00:04:23.750> be<00:04:23.900> could<00:04:24.050> really

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
fire rate and that would be could really

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.230 
fire rate and that would be could really
really<00:04:24.590> beast<00:04:24.979> but<00:04:25.639> if<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.820> guys<00:04:25.969> notice

of how well that performs so and we go
ahead<00:05:56.240> and<00:05:56.419> if<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.780> guys<00:05:56.900> noticed<00:05:57.229> there's

ahead and if you guys noticed there's

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.440 
ahead and if you guys noticed there's
not<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:58.250> much<00:05:58.520> difference<00:05:59.030> between<00:05:59.180> the

not that much difference between the
impact<00:05:59.840> and<00:06:00.050> the<00:06:00.080> range<00:06:00.290> still<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.770> felt

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
impact and the range still the felt

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.050 
impact and the range still the felt
winters<00:06:01.250> light<00:06:01.400> is<00:06:01.550> still<00:06:01.790> a<00:06:01.820> little<00:06:01.940> bit

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
winters light is still a little bit

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.180 
winters light is still a little bit
better<00:06:02.240> but<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:02.990> Astro<00:06:03.320> horizon<00:06:03.890> you<00:06:04.070> know<00:06:04.160> I

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
better but the Astro horizon you know I

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.710 
better but the Astro horizon you know I
could<00:06:04.490> I'd<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.820> reason<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.150> didn't<00:06:05.419> include<00:06:05.630> it

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
could I'd the reason I didn't include it

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.540 
could I'd the reason I didn't include it
was<00:06:05.990> because<00:06:06.350> it<00:06:06.470> was<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.590> trial<00:06:06.950> weapon<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:07.490> I

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
was because it was a trial weapon and I

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
in the Astra Pro rise and wouldn't be

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
able to be rolled it would be a beast of

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.080 
able to be rolled it would be a beast of
a<00:06:30.290> weapon<00:06:30.560> again<00:06:30.800> see<00:06:30.979> it<00:06:31.190> compares<00:06:31.610> fairly

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090

fairly<00:06:32.330> close<00:06:32.630> when<00:06:33.260> it<00:06:33.380> comes<00:06:33.560> to<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.800> fell

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
fairly close when it comes to the fell

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.860

winter line with all those wee rolls it

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.839 
winter line with all those wee rolls it
would<00:06:35.990> be<00:06:36.140> a<00:06:36.320> killer<00:06:36.800> killer<00:06:37.130> of<00:06:37.430> a<00:06:37.520> weapon

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849
