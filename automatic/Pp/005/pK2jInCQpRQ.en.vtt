 4 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 m 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.539
 ap 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 the box 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.840
 there's everybody guys that's the one 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.100
 I hope you are well I have 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 really great guys and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.810
 video the first episode of the new 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.430
 series of challenges on adam know strong 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.620
 but I had already done this series on 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.060
 black ops of mw3 but I said to myself 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.710
 because new call of on will go back to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.690
 zero of the stroke is in quotation marks the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 season 2 and for this first challenge you 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.080
 do not be disappointed first of all I 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 thanks co2 qg code cfl called your 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.660
 dreams 6.2 me balls because that's 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.160
 still more argue I like it is a 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.410
 trip the world record that's all 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.090
 just the 75 kg chalenge would even 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.740
 so the purpose of this challenge is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.340
 simple is to do the 75 kg and even 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.930
 alone 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 so basically but allies are all at 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 shield it paralyzes edenly tells me 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 their positions and I have to do the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.890
 75 that we'll see that it's going very 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.310
 to do well since I'm going to make 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.540
 75 for a growing 15 ratio 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 with a little dna so I actually 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.729
 to make 4 kills 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 I'm going to die then I'm going to do 71 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.640
 that in a row so it's still 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.930
 no shit and i was playing at the asm 1 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.580
 so we were sure instinct well 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 obviously mahorais but wants and I do 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.280
 a big dedication to all the allies 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.790
 without whom this challenge would not have been 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 possible 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.229
 we fight with galactic raptor 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.280
 francky dextrine and kaisen a big big 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.930
 apple because without being frankly 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.340
 the guys would not have had to challenge themselves and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.580
 tomorrow it's really great 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 pass 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.600
 there will be even a small dn1 and more 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.740
 yeah the gameplay lasts five minutes 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 because frankly I chained them 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 crazy 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.770
 so I'm not going to lie to you it was 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.110
 really a dengue host they 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.280
 were super bad in front but that's it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.750
 I can not help it frankly 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.370
 I had already tried to challenge myself at the exit 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.140
 of the game a week after the release of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.880
 game and we had a little bit of trouble 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
 blow we had abandoned and then the proud 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.120
 because I did this gameplay yesterday I 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.989
 tell me why not retried and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.610
 frankly guys I swear to you 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.080
 first part we throw we fall 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 in this reception , moreover, that I 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.959
 you would have set to normal music 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.890
 at the beginning of video and frankly he 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.170
 was bad I will not lie to you 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.850
 he was really bad almost 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.350
 almost anyone could have done it 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.209
 on his enemies there because he was 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.230
 really but no one to shit but hey it's 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.900
 not because they are they I'm going 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.850
 not posted the gameplay me the challenge I them 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.680
 do after the enemies I do not care 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.299
 totally of their level I know 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.350
 that I did the challenge so the guts 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.340
 their agreement because there are three records 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.080
 of the world anyway I spoke to them 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.340
 quickly so it's the dryat of 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.320
 records that can not be beaten 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.640
 so the 75 that he loved me fight it's 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.590
 the maximum I could not be beaten 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.140
 to be leveled to the limit but not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.720
 beaten 75 rations even had parÃ©age 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.000
 to be equalized but not shot down and the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 bigger that would still be so 71 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.270
 where I might be beaten because 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.300
 well it's possible that someone does 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.530
 75 but it's going to be pretty complicated so 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.670
 here I am pretty shocked that nobody 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.650
 did not think about doing this challenge because 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.450
 I personally have already done on bo mw3 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.230
 and apparently not on this person game 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.850
 did not have the idea to tempt him 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.320
 so I know there is my poto angelo of 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.459
 the rage that he too has tried but he 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.770
 apparently did not succeed so I 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.880
 pascal a little dedication and so here 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.020
 do not hesitate to give me your challenges in 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.390
 comment it would make me happy 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.340
 why not soon tempted dna in r &amp; d 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.170
 or the vicious first in R &amp; D because 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.550
 the dna it's going to be pretty complicated or 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.720
 even the double dna would have even had 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.010
 maybe with colleagues too 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.260
 that they help me or other challenges like 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.489
 it may be a paladin without doing any 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.720
 kiel just one day the goal that 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.130
 could be nice of the kind of challenge 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.090
 like that if you have ideas 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.410
 do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.940
 comment it makes me super happy 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.340
 here you are with the gameplay I'm already 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.560
 in 38 38 years so the chain not bad 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.209
 frankly I did 4 kills so I 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.620
 am dead from the beginning and you go 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.910
 see finally you have already seen that I am 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.709
 dead but like a shit when reloading 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.590
 in front of an enemy and finally down after 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.850
 71 he in a row then dna and everything and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.530
 you will see that I have a lot of rock 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.940
 I will have a lot a lot a lot 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.920
 of luck I'm going to be pretty red at 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.670
 several moments and so here I am 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.470
 he was on time 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.519
 interracial couple claude me savadra me 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.930

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.940
 introduce quickly my name is julien 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.549
 I am 16 years old alias the big machine on 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.340
 youtube hulu on xbox 360 and ps 4 in 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.120
 few days but only for christmas 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.440
 by the way we will talk about Christmas and just 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.209
 after that it's a little bit about the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.609
 video and yeah so I'm 16 years old 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.470
 I have seen on youtube since June 2013 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.000
 so a year and a half now soon 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 two camps ranks in his sentence two 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.630
 years I have 4200 subscribers and that would make me 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.040
 pleasure to enlarge a little bit my 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.940
 community because I finally think 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.890
 that's what I'm often told that I 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.940

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.320
 why not tell them a little bit 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.150
 community to be able to present but 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.830
 gameplay to more people possible 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.390
