00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
in particular the way the hook is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.109 
in particular the way the hook is
actually<00:00:25.260> positioned<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.400> image<00:00:26.640> along

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
actually positioned in this image along

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
actually positioned in this image along
with<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> text<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.320> screen

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
with the text we see on screen

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
with the text we see on screen
absolutely<00:00:29.580> yeah<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.269> interesting

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
absolutely yeah it's really interesting

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.420 
absolutely yeah it's really interesting
I<00:00:30.900> mean<00:00:31.080> initially<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.859> both<00:00:32.099> saw<00:00:32.279> this

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I mean initially when we both saw this

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.069 
I mean initially when we both saw this
image<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.790> were<00:00:32.910> more<00:00:33.120> interested<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.570> what

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
image we were more interested in what

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
image we were more interested in what
the<00:00:34.170> text<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.649> said<00:00:35.070> weren't<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.489> yes<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the text actually said weren't we yes I

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
the text actually said weren't we yes I
believe<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.750> said<00:00:36.930> murderer<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.649> first<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
believe it said murderer at first I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.560 
believe it said murderer at first I
think<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> lot<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.059> people<00:00:39.329> went<00:00:39.480> with

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
think I think a lot of people went with

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.910 
think I think a lot of people went with
a<00:00:39.629> hole<00:00:39.780> murderer<00:00:40.170> thing<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> seemed<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> make

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a hole murderer thing it seemed to make

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
a hole murderer thing it seemed to make
most<00:00:41.100> sense<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> really

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
most sense because it was a really

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
most sense because it was a really
prominent<00:00:42.660> areand<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.410> was<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
prominent areand and that was one of the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
prominent areand and that was one of the
only<00:00:44.219> letters<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> could<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.090> yeah<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
only letters you could see yeah it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
only letters you could see yeah it
actually<00:00:45.930> came<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> light<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> says

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
actually came to light that this says

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
actually came to light that this says
out<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> order<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
out of order and this was one of the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
out of order and this was one of the
first<00:00:49.050> times<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.620> correction<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
first times we actually correction this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040 
first times we actually correction this
was<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> first<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.300> we've<00:00:51.420> seen<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:51.780> text

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
was the first time we've seen some text

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
was the first time we've seen some text
on<00:00:52.140> these<00:00:52.230> images<00:00:52.649> other<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:53.160> nightmare

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
on these images other than nightmare

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.340 
on these images other than nightmare
which<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.940> hidden<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> cryptic

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
which is hidden in some kind of cryptic

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
which is hidden in some kind of cryptic
manner<00:00:55.649> yes<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> people<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.510> been

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
manner yes so a lot of people have been

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
manner yes so a lot of people have been
pointing<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.859> us<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> hook<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
pointing out to us that the hook is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
pointing out to us that the hook is
placed<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.359> question<00:01:00.989> mark<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.829> way

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
placed in a question mark kind of way

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.490 
placed in a question mark kind of way
almost<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> order<00:01:04.320> within

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
almost like we see out of order within

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.350 
almost like we see out of order within
the<00:01:04.769> mouth<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> hook<00:01:05.790> represents<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the mouth and in the hook represents a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.789 
the mouth and in the hook represents a
question<00:01:06.540> mark<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> say<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> it's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
question mark as if to say is it's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
question mark as if to say is it's
actually<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> order<00:01:09.210> yeah<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.960> think

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually out of order yeah and I think

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.359 
actually out of order yeah and I think
when<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.439> came<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.830> light<00:01:10.860> meaning<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> were

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
when this came to light meaning you were

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
when this came to light meaning you were
both<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.700> bit<00:01:11.970> startled<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.720> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
both a little bit startled with this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
both a little bit startled with this
because<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
because it's actually well as I say it's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.670 
because it's actually well as I say it's
startling<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.530> represents

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
startling because it actually represents

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
startling because it actually represents
something<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:17.670> hold<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.150> based<00:01:18.450> on

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
something that could hold up based on

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.510 
something that could hold up based on
the<00:01:18.750> position<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.500> why<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.710> Texas<00:01:20.159> Wynn<00:01:20.310> place

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the position of why the Texas Wynn place

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.039 
the position of why the Texas Wynn place
alongside<00:01:20.909> many<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> features<00:01:21.900> which

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
alongside many of the features which

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
alongside many of the features which
we're<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> get<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.130> away<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
we're going to get into right away so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.130 
we're going to get into right away so
we're<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
we're first going to look at the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.929 
we're first going to look at the
position<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.979> text<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.460> relation<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
position of this text in relation to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.819 
position of this text in relation to
this<00:01:27.119> image<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.590> Scott

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
this image because we think that Scott

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.920 
this image because we think that Scott
has<00:01:28.920> definitely<00:01:29.340> positioned<00:01:30.060> foxy<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> such<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
has definitely positioned foxy in such a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.840 
has definitely positioned foxy in such a
way<00:01:31.140> which<00:01:31.320> warrants<00:01:31.799> almost<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.460> position

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
way which warrants almost a position

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.789 
way which warrants almost a position
when<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> text<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
when the then of the text and also the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249 
when the then of the text and also the
hook<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.600> order<00:01:36.810> text

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hook so we see this out of order text

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
hook so we see this out of order text
within<00:01:37.470> his<00:01:37.740> mouth<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.400> instantly<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> have

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
within his mouth now instantly we have

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
within his mouth now instantly we have
to<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.630> why<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.170> text<00:01:40.500> placed<00:01:40.710> within

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to think why is this text placed within

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
to think why is this text placed within
his<00:01:41.250> mouth<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.850> been<00:01:41.939> anywhere

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
his mouth this could have been anywhere

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.760 
his mouth this could have been anywhere
on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> image<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> most<00:01:43.229> prominent<00:01:43.619> thing

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
on the image the most prominent thing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
on the image the most prominent thing
usually<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.549> whole<00:01:44.759> nightmare<00:01:45.119> theme

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
usually is this whole nightmare theme

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
usually is this whole nightmare theme
which<00:01:45.600> engulfs<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> whole<00:01:46.619> image<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.189> most<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
which engulfs the whole image on most of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
which engulfs the whole image on most of
these<00:01:47.520> recent<00:01:47.909> ones<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.020> order

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
these recent ones but this out of order

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
these recent ones but this out of order
text<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.250> taking<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> spotlight<00:01:51.240> here

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
text is really taking the spotlight here

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
text is really taking the spotlight here
and<00:01:51.570> because<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> within<00:01:52.229> his<00:01:52.350> mouth<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and because it's within his mouth is

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010

within the mouth could suggest that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.180 
within the mouth could suggest that
maybe<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.740> there's<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.130> many

it's just one of the phone guys favorite

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.330 
it's just one of the phone guys favorite
animatronics<00:02:37.230> clearly<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.190> seems

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
animatronics clearly and it just seems

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.860 
animatronics clearly and it just seems
that<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.610> too<00:02:38.790> much<00:02:38.940> entwined<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.660> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that it's too much entwined with this so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
that it's too much entwined with this so
the<00:02:40.140> fact<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.680> out<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.980> order<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the fact that the out of order is in the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
the fact that the out of order is in the
mouth<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.270> seems<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:42.900> maybe<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.680> was

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
mouth it just seems like maybe this was

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.800 
mouth it just seems like maybe this was
what<00:02:44.250> caused<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:44.610> foxy<00:02:45.060> may<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.420> caused<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
what caused it foxy may have caused the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.470 
what caused it foxy may have caused the
bite<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.110> 87<00:02:46.250> possibly<00:02:47.250> with<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.910> sharp<00:02:48.210> teeth

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
bite of 87 possibly with the sharp teeth

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330 
bite of 87 possibly with the sharp teeth
and<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> wide<00:02:49.350> mouth<00:02:49.620> who<00:02:49.890> seems<00:02:50.160> to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
and just the wide mouth who seems to

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.860 
and just the wide mouth who seems to
possess<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.970> now<00:02:51.270> we're<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.600> move<00:02:51.750> over

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
possess and now we're going to move over

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.270 
possess and now we're going to move over
to<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.140> actual<00:02:52.380> placement<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> hook

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to the actual placement of the hook

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.360 
to the actual placement of the hook
because<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.900> me<00:02:55.050> actually<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.710> quite

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
because this to me actually is quite

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
because this to me actually is quite
startling<00:02:56.910> as<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.120> said<00:02:57.360> before<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:57.960> because

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
startling as I said before now because

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.810 
startling as I said before now because
this<00:02:58.740> hook<00:02:58.950> actually<00:02:59.310> looks<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.580> question

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
this hook actually looks like a question

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.550 
this hook actually looks like a question
mark<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> tech<00:03:00.630> seems<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.170> stretched

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
mark and the tech seems to be stretched

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.590 
mark and the tech seems to be stretched
in<00:03:01.770> such<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> way<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> actually<00:03:02.610> almost<00:03:03.300> mimic

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
in such a way to actually almost mimic

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.500 
in such a way to actually almost mimic
the<00:03:03.930> same<00:03:04.170> size<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.950> proportional<00:03:05.850> nature<00:03:06.420> of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the same size and proportional nature of

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.090 
the same size and proportional nature of
the<00:03:06.630> hook<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.990> seems<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.710> question

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
the hook it seems like it's a question

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.920 
the hook it seems like it's a question
mark<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.460> this<00:03:08.850> could<00:03:09.060> almost<00:03:09.180> give<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
mark and this could almost give the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.930 
mark and this could almost give the
audience<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.800> said<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.010> community<00:03:11.400> s<00:03:11.700> a

audience what I said the community s a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.450
