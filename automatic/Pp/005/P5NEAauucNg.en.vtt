00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
I'm really letting EA decide what is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.150 
I'm really letting EA decide what is
gonna<00:00:36.930> happen<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.440> called<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.010> EA

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
gonna happen it's called the EA

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.430 
gonna happen it's called the EA
predictor<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> will<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:39.870> gonna<00:00:39.960> let<00:00:40.230> EA

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
predictor if you will we're gonna let EA

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.680

decide<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.399> let<00:00:41.790> them<00:00:41.940> decide<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.329> they

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
decide or let them decide what they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500 
decide or let them decide what they
think<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.620> score<00:00:43.950> line<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> then

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
think the score line will be and then

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
think the score line will be and then
using<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.930> we're<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.379> put<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> few<00:00:47.039> bets

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
entirely possible obviously there's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
entirely possible obviously there's
gonna<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> lot<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> games<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.250> every<00:01:11.790> day<00:01:11.939> but

gonna be a lot of games at every day but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
gonna be a lot of games at every day but
I<00:01:12.450> try<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:12.930> pick<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> best<00:01:13.439> ones<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I try and pick out the best ones for you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
I try and pick out the best ones for you
guys<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.720> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
guys and kind of do those I think that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.179 
guys and kind of do those I think that
would<00:01:16.110> probably<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> best<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
would probably be the best way to do it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
would probably be the best way to do it
and<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> I've<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.409> for

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and so the first one that I've got for

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
and so the first one that I've got for
you<00:01:19.619> guys<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> fact<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.640> spain<00:01:21.479> vs

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
you guys is in fact I'm spain vs
netherlands<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.040> believe<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.490> be

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
netherlands which I believe will be

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.840 
netherlands which I believe will be
happening<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> 13th<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> really

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
happening on the 13th and it is a really

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
happening on the 13th and it is a really
big<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> mean<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:28.020> sides<00:01:28.320> are

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
I'm not too sure if that will make a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.950 
I'm not too sure if that will make a
difference<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:04.090> can<00:03:04.270> put<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> next

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960
