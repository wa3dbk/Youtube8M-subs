toward the end of the game and I don't
know<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.550> most<00:02:50.790> likely<00:02:50.880> probably<00:02:51.330> wouldn't

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
know it most likely probably wouldn't

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.140 
know it most likely probably wouldn't
help<00:02:51.960> Denny<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:53.580> kept<00:02:53.790> us<00:02:53.910> it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
help Denny but it would have kept us it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.450 
help Denny but it would have kept us it
would<00:02:54.330> make<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> game<00:02:54.750> even<00:02:54.930> closer<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:55.680> you

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
would make the game even closer as you

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.720 
would make the game even closer as you
can<00:02:56.550> see<00:02:56.730> right<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.770> have<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> very<00:02:59.220> very

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
can see right here I have a very very

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.090 
can see right here I have a very very
high<00:03:00.030> load<00:03:00.300> out<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.650> reason<00:03:01.920> i<00:03:01.980> was

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
high load out on and the reason i was

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.830 
high load out on and the reason i was
doing<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.670> i<00:03:02.940> was<00:03:03.240> like<00:03:03.390> man<00:03:03.570> fuck

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
doing this because i was like man fuck

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720 
doing this because i was like man fuck
it<00:03:03.870> let's<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.260> try<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.680> at<00:03:05.010> least<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.490> time

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
it let's just try this at least one time

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.570 
it let's just try this at least one time
so<00:03:06.540> I've<00:03:07.380> been<00:03:07.530> known<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:08.100> able<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.430> put

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
so I've been known to be able to put

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.130 
so I've been known to be able to put
together<00:03:08.670> some<00:03:09.060> very<00:03:09.270> high<00:03:09.450> killstreaks<00:03:09.750> on

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
together some very high killstreaks on

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.960 
together some very high killstreaks on
these<00:03:10.290> games<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.520> one<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.760> them<00:03:11.880> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
these games and this is one of them I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.140 
these games and this is one of them I
actually<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.410> my<00:03:13.920> goal<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
actually do it so my goal here is to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
actually do it so my goal here is to
basically<00:03:15.600> stay<00:03:16.050> around<00:03:16.350> be<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:16.920> when<00:03:17.130> we

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
basically stay around be like when we

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.980 
basically stay around be like when we
lost<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.760> beef<00:03:17.940> leg<00:03:18.150> again<00:03:18.450> right<00:03:18.630> here<00:03:18.810> and

lost the beef leg again right here and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.210 
lost the beef leg again right here and
the<00:03:19.050> reason<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.620> because<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.920> had<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> go

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the reason that is because I had to go

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.310

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
kill streak so far on this game is the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.100 
kill streak so far on this game is the
lodestar<00:04:53.400> itself<00:04:53.760> because<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.660> seems<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:54.990> a

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
lodestar itself because it seems like a

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900 
lodestar itself because it seems like a
lot<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.380> people<00:04:55.590> ignore<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.640> still

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
lot of people ignore and you can still

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.330 
lot of people ignore and you can still
get<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.420> know<00:04:58.020> anywhere<00:04:58.410> from<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.680> six<00:04:59.160> to

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
get you know anywhere from like six to

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.180 
get you know anywhere from like six to
ten<00:04:59.550> kills<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.900> bed<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.320> that's<00:05:01.920> all<00:05:02.160> it

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
ten kills in this bed and that's all it

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.620 
ten kills in this bed and that's all it
really<00:05:02.340> matters<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.880> me<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.090> how<00:05:03.270> many<00:05:03.330> kills

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
really matters to me is how many kills

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.720 
really matters to me is how many kills
not<00:05:03.810> how<00:05:03.900> many<00:05:04.050> points<00:05:04.410> they<00:05:04.470> get<00:05:04.800> or<00:05:04.980> now<00:05:05.580> how

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
not how many points they get or now how

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.180 
not how many points they get or now how
fun<00:05:06.060> they<00:05:06.210> are<00:05:06.390> like<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.200> 22<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.860> seems<00:05:08.070> to

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
fun they are like the 22 that seems to

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.310 
fun they are like the 22 that seems to
get<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.430> most<00:05:08.580> kills<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.240> dogs<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
get the most kills is the dogs and the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.180 
get the most kills is the dogs and the
lodestar<00:05:11.540> draw<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.840> swarm<00:05:13.140> of<00:05:13.260> drones<00:05:13.560> it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
lodestar draw the swarm of drones it

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.310 
lodestar draw the swarm of drones it
gets<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:14.790> lot<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.060> kills<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.360> but<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:15.840> really

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
gets a lot of kills to but it's really

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.320 
gets a lot of kills to but it's really
high<00:05:16.530> up<00:05:16.560> there<00:05:16.920> I<00:05:17.160> almost<00:05:17.580> feel<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.090> they

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
high up there I almost feel like they

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.270 
high up there I almost feel like they
need<00:05:18.540> to<00:05:18.720> lower<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.170> killstreaks<00:05:19.890> just<00:05:20.160> a

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280
