the realism as much as possible you can

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
the realism as much as possible you can
see<00:00:09.690> from<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> color<00:00:10.050> palette<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.920> lot<00:00:11.429> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
dave has drawn in the book I call it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.900 
dave has drawn in the book I call it
like<00:00:17.449> stylized<00:00:18.449> realism<00:00:21.320> with<00:00:22.320> Watchmen<00:00:23.010> not

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
like stylized realism with Watchmen not

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
like stylized realism with Watchmen not
through<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.480> treatment<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> film<00:00:25.260> where

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
through the treatment of the film where

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.660 
through the treatment of the film where
we<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> emulate<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.160> look<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we trying to emulate the look of the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.099 
we trying to emulate the look of the
book<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> secondary

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
book but the use of the secondary

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
book but the use of the secondary
palette<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:29.670> more<00:00:29.990> subconscious

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
palette it's a little more subconscious

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:41.610 
palette it's a little more subconscious
but<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.740> influence<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.160> definitely<00:00:32.460> there

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.680 

Zach<00:00:42.620> storyboard<00:00:43.400> Germania<00:00:44.090> we<00:00:44.480> know

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
Zach storyboard Germania we know

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.110 
Zach storyboard Germania we know
everything<00:00:45.380> what<00:00:45.590> we're<00:00:45.770> doing<00:00:46.130> it's<00:00:46.640> so

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
everything what we're doing it's so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.300 
everything what we're doing it's so
helpful<00:00:47.660> because<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.770> roughly<00:00:49.100> know

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
helpful because you you roughly know

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.280 
helpful because you you roughly know
your<00:00:49.520> angles<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.390> where<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.690> put<00:00:50.870> your<00:00:51.050> lights

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
your angles and where to put your lights

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.610 
your angles and where to put your lights
and<00:00:51.620> stuff<00:00:51.980> like<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:52.610> yeah<00:00:52.970> I<00:00:53.560> wouldn't<00:00:54.560> say

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
and stuff like that yeah I wouldn't say

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.900 
and stuff like that yeah I wouldn't say
necessarily<00:00:54.800> there's<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.280> one<00:00:55.460> lighting<00:00:55.640> style

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
necessarily there's a one lighting style

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.730 
necessarily there's a one lighting style
I<00:00:55.970> can<00:00:56.000> say<00:00:56.300> you're<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.600> this<00:00:56.780> era<00:00:57.140> or<00:00:57.320> not<00:00:57.470> but

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
I can say you're in this era or not but

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.620 
I can say you're in this era or not but
it<00:00:57.830> jumps<00:00:58.070> back<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.340> forth<00:00:58.520> some<00:00:58.790> things<00:00:59.450> like

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
it jumps back and forth some things like

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.300 
it jumps back and forth some things like
very<00:00:59.960> modern<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.590> maybe<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.100> wouldn't<00:01:01.250> have

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
very modern and maybe you wouldn't have

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.630 
very modern and maybe you wouldn't have
seen<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.410> film<00:01:03.650> in<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.830> 80s<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:04.460> other

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
seen in a film in the 80s but other

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.510 
seen in a film in the 80s but other
parts<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.570> know<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.840> film<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.170> think

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
parts you know the film I think

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.010 
parts you know the film I think
completely<00:01:07.520> feel<00:01:07.790> like<00:01:07.970> you're<00:01:08.900> being

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
completely feel like you're being

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.230 
completely feel like you're being
transported<00:01:09.500> though<00:01:09.980> we're<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.220> al-shibh<00:01:10.970> we

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
transported though we're in al-shibh we

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.390 
transported though we're in al-shibh we
have<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> love<00:01:11.750> scene<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.260> now<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.070> know<00:01:13.250> we

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
have a love scene in now you know we

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.870 
have a love scene in now you know we
just<00:01:13.970> moon<00:01:14.300> light<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:15.110> then<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.369> snow

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
just moon light and then we have snow

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.580 
just moon light and then we have snow
and<00:01:17.660> lights<00:01:18.020> on

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and lights on

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.060 
and lights on
obviously<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.790> can't<00:01:20.830> put<00:01:21.830> lights

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
obviously you can't put lights

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.240 
obviously you can't put lights
everywhere<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:22.940> have<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.360> cheat<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.680> it's

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
everywhere you have to cheat and it's

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.310 
everywhere you have to cheat and it's
very<00:01:25.490> difficult<00:01:25.970> when<00:01:26.450> you're<00:01:26.660> through<00:01:26.869> in<00:01:27.110> a

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
very difficult when you're through in a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.010 
very difficult when you're through in a
small<00:01:27.560> area<00:01:27.800> like<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.420> start<00:01:29.420> shooting<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.930> a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
small area like that start shooting in a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020 
small area like that start shooting in a
shoebox

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
shoebox

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.270 
shoebox
Zach's<00:01:32.030> approach<00:01:32.509> has<00:01:32.990> been<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.590> very

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
Zach's approach has been a very

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.030 
Zach's approach has been a very
traditional<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.600> shooting<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.650> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
traditional way of shooting and a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.280 
traditional way of shooting and a
traditional<00:01:37.700> way<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:37.869> composition<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
traditional way of composition and the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.990 
traditional way of composition and the
best<00:01:39.530> way<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.740> do<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.220> was<00:01:40.400> sometimes<00:01:40.790> with<00:01:40.970> a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
best way to do that was sometimes with a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.380 
best way to do that was sometimes with a
single<00:01:41.360> camera<00:01:42.700> would<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.790> make<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:43.940> movie<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
single camera would you make a movie a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.330 
single camera would you make a movie a
lot<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.810> times<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.350> take<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.590> second<00:01:45.979> camera

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
lot of times you take a second camera

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.279 
lot of times you take a second camera
and<00:01:46.520> if<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.759> actors<00:01:47.060> are<00:01:47.179> talking<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.050> stick

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
and if the actors are talking you stick

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.840 
and if the actors are talking you stick
a<00:01:48.320> second<00:01:48.740> camera<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.100> there<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.429> try<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.640> get

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
a second camera in there to try and get

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.100 
a second camera in there to try and get
a<00:01:49.880> close-up<00:01:50.119> or<00:01:50.479> something<00:01:50.720> like<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
a close-up or something like that to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.960 
a close-up or something like that to
make<00:01:51.289> it<00:01:51.320> move<00:01:51.530> along<00:01:51.770> faster<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.429> second

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
make it move along faster that second

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
make it move along faster that second
camera<00:01:53.149> normally<00:01:53.330> suffers<00:01:53.899> a<00:01:54.080> little<00:01:54.229> bit<00:01:54.470> in

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
camera normally suffers a little bit in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.499 
camera normally suffers a little bit in
its<00:01:54.770> composition<00:01:55.220> design<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:56.060> because<00:01:56.179> it's

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
its composition design just because it's

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.930 
its composition design just because it's
not<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.929> primary<00:01:57.200> focus<00:01:57.440> but<00:01:58.190> for<00:01:58.369> this<00:01:58.490> movie

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
not the primary focus but for this movie

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.380 
not the primary focus but for this movie
it's<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.360> one<00:01:59.569> camera<00:01:59.990> shell<00:02:00.880> his<00:02:01.880> shots<00:02:02.149> are<00:02:02.300> so

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
it's a one camera shell his shots are so

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.389 
it's a one camera shell his shots are so
designed<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.440> hard<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.770> kind<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.009> get<00:02:04.160> a<00:02:04.190> B

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
designed so it's hard to kind of get a B

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.249 
designed so it's hard to kind of get a B
camera<00:02:04.789> just<00:02:05.060> somewhere<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.899> get<00:02:05.990> another

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
camera just somewhere to get another

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.499 
camera just somewhere to get another
shot<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:06.890> know<00:02:07.100> he<00:02:07.220> won't<00:02:07.280> use<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.670> when

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
shot if you know he won't use it when

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.150 
shot if you know he won't use it when
you're<00:02:08.600> doing<00:02:08.780> 180<00:02:09.229> degree<00:02:09.470> dolly<00:02:09.679> moves<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
you're doing 180 degree dolly moves and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.110 
you're doing 180 degree dolly moves and
stuff<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:10.429> me<00:02:10.580> where<00:02:10.700> do<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.789> put<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> other

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
stuff like me where do you put the other

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.780 
stuff like me where do you put the other
camera<00:02:11.480> yeah<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:12.830> great<00:02:12.980> for<00:02:13.220> me<00:02:13.340> because<00:02:13.580> I

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
camera yeah it's great for me because I

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.700 
camera yeah it's great for me because I
means<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.360> make<00:02:14.540> each<00:02:14.720> shot<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.590> way<00:02:15.680> I

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
means I can make each shot the way I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.320 
means I can make each shot the way I
want<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.040> about<00:02:16.520> compromising<00:02:17.150> which<00:02:17.240> you

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
want it to about compromising which you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.910 
want it to about compromising which you
usually<00:02:17.480> get<00:02:17.750> when<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.050> two<00:02:18.380> three<00:02:18.740> or

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
usually get when you have two three or

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.940 
usually get when you have two three or
four<00:02:18.950> cameras<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.940> shots<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.620> and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
four cameras the shots are there and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.790 
four cameras the shots are there and
they<00:02:22.100> sit<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.730> action<00:02:23.210> plays<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.319> think<00:02:24.650> we

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
they sit and action plays out I think we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.380 
they sit and action plays out I think we
always<00:02:24.920> do<00:02:25.130> watch<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:25.610> would<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.180> way

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
always do watch but would be this way

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.990 
always do watch but would be this way
more<00:02:26.660> practical<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.290> even<00:02:28.040> at<00:02:28.100> 300<00:02:28.730> you

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
more practical I think even at 300 you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.400 
more practical I think even at 300 you
know<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> green<00:02:29.630> screen<00:02:29.870> was<00:02:29.990> more<00:02:30.200> about

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
know all the green screen was more about

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.070 
know all the green screen was more about
skies<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.130> distant<00:02:31.520> background<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.240> think<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
skies and distant background I think a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840 
skies and distant background I think a
lot<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.350> visual<00:02:33.680> interest<00:02:34.069> isn't<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.700> in

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
lot of the visual interest isn't just in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.030 
lot of the visual interest isn't just in
sprinkling<00:02:35.510> magic<00:02:36.050> post-production<00:02:36.680> look<00:02:36.860> on

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
sprinkling magic post-production look on

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.620 
sprinkling magic post-production look on
it<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.670> design<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.150> shots<00:02:38.390> and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
it but just the design of the shots and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.760 
it but just the design of the shots and
that<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> sets<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.380> lighting<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
that the sets and of the lighting and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.860 
that the sets and of the lighting and
it's<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.400> dark<00:02:40.610> movie<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.510> see<00:02:41.660> some<00:02:41.810> of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
it's a dark movie so you see some of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.720 
it's a dark movie so you see some of
these<00:02:41.930> sets<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:43.160> really

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
these sets and you know really really

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.190 
these sets and you know really really
dark<00:02:43.880> there's<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.240> edge<00:02:44.390> where<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.660> keeping

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
dark there's that edge where you keeping

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.420 
dark there's that edge where you keeping
in<00:02:45.290> sets<00:02:45.500> really<00:02:45.620> dark<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.130> still<00:02:46.310> want

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
in sets really dark but you still want

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.970 
in sets really dark but you still want
to<00:02:46.459> show<00:02:46.640> off<00:02:46.790> how<00:02:47.060> amazing<00:02:47.510> they<00:02:47.720> are

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.870 

if<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.100> go<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> streets<00:02:55.580> of<00:02:55.640> New<00:02:55.730> York

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
if you go on the streets of New York

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.490 
if you go on the streets of New York
which<00:02:56.060> I've<00:02:56.180> done<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.720> had<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.900> turn<00:02:57.170> off<00:02:57.230> all

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
which I've done you had to turn off all

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.420 
which I've done you had to turn off all
the<00:02:57.620> streetlights<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.130> are<00:02:58.280> making

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
the streetlights that are making

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.830 
the streetlights that are making
multiple<00:02:58.850> shadows<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.420> put<00:02:59.630> your<00:02:59.720> beautiful

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
multiple shadows and put your beautiful

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.540 
multiple shadows and put your beautiful
light<00:03:00.200> in<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.410> place<00:03:00.650> or<00:03:00.830> something<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:01.430> we

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
light in one place or something but we

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.559 
light in one place or something but we
ended<00:03:01.700> up<00:03:01.790> into<00:03:01.940> kind<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.150> not<00:03:02.270> really<00:03:02.450> doing

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
ended up into kind of not really doing

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.690 
ended up into kind of not really doing
that<00:03:02.840> left<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.740> street<00:03:04.010> lights<00:03:04.160> are<00:03:04.340> turned

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
that left all street lights are turned

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.190 
that left all street lights are turned
more<00:03:04.850> lights<00:03:05.270> on<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.569> make<00:03:05.690> more<00:03:05.900> multiple

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
more lights on to make more multiple

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.140 
more lights on to make more multiple
shadows<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.770> then<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.640> know<00:03:07.730> didn't<00:03:08.000> use<00:03:08.120> a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
shadows and then you know didn't use a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.270 
shadows and then you know didn't use a
lot<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.300> fill<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.840> think<00:03:09.260> that's<00:03:09.470> why<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.770> kind

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
lot of fill I think that's why it kind

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.000 
lot of fill I think that's why it kind
of<00:03:10.400> feels<00:03:11.080> real<00:03:12.730> watch<00:03:13.730> many
