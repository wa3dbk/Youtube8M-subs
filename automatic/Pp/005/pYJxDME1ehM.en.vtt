00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello in this video we're going 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 see how the hypothalamus complex 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 pituitary is involved in the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.770
 reproductive control in humans 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.770
 then at the woman 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.750
 if we make a cut of 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.670
 testicles we can observe these 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.080
 structures 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.939
 the tubes these mini do with in the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.489
 sperm tube light at 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.860
 the mature individuals of the cells 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.699
 interstitial between the tubes these mini 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.410
 do and blood vessels the 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.030
 interstitial cells is called the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.670
 cells of the dike we will see 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.589
 their role later some cells 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.059
 of the wall of sleeping pills are 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:57.559
 the sertoli cells they are 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:59.539
 involved in spermatogenesis if we 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.149
 let's go back to our hormones secreted by the 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.199
 Pituitary hypo talamo complex that 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.940
 so happens by the blood vessels 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.060
 since they joined the system 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.399
 blood the fsh will come to stimulate the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.700
 sertoli cells and so the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.380
 spermatogenesis there she as for it goes 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 come stimulate the cells of the eye 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.940
 dike that will in turn produce 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.250
 the testosterone that will stimulate 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.810
 also the sertoli cells for 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.850
 the production of spermatozoa 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 we remember that testosterone 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.110
 also has a role in maintaining 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.970
 secondary sexual characters and in 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.200
 libido 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.509
 but this testosterone joins 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.380
 also the blood system and she has 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.049
 a feedback effect on the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.079
 pituitary hypothalamus complex in 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.290
 testosterone effect is going to have a retro 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:55.810
 negative control over the hypothalamus and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:02.390
 the pituitary gland generating less 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:06.439
 production of gm rh and fsh so the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.709
 gnrh comes - stimulate poppys and fsh 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:16.070
 and lh will stimulate - productions 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:18.410
 testicular so there will be less of 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.970
 produced testosterone and the retro 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.340
 negative controls will be less than 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.829
 will allow a return to normal 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 system which maintains a rate of 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.230
 testosterone of gnrh fsh and lh around 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.300
 average value 15 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.360
 in humans which allows the production 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.540
 is continuously producing gametes at 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.540
 the man 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.090
 to summarize the hormonal control of the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.910
 reproduction in humans 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.720
 we have our structures the hypothalamus 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.610
 the pituitary gland and the testicles in the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 testes the sertoli cells and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.040
 the cells of the dike eye 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.220
 the hypothalamus secretes the gnrh a neuro 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.489
 hormones that stimulates the pituitary gland 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.840
 which in turn will generate fsh that 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.200
 stimulate the cells 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.860
 sertoli that will be involved in the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.870
 spermatogenesis but the pituitary gland secretes 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.400
 also from the lnh that she comes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.620
 stimulate in the testicles the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.130
 cells of the dike that will secrete 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.350
 from testosterone the testosterone goes 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.000
 in turn stimulate the cells of 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.050
 sertoli and maintain the characters 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.880
 secondary sex and libido 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 and then testosterone is going to have a retro 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.720
 negative control back on the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.720
 pituitary hypothalamus complex
