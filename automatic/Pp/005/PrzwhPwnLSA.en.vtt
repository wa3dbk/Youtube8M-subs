00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.280
 7 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 discovered has said no to the girls 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.030
 how to be in today's day we are going to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.920
 make an easy dessert and this is one of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.150
 my favorite desserts because the truth 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 is that it is extremely easy and also 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 combine the fruits in this case we are going to 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 make an apple crispy but 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 we could make a crispy for example 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 of peach or other fruits that have 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 more about the same consistency and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
 that are not as watered down as they can be 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 the watermelon or that are not so hard 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.850
 can be even banana can be 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
 well obviously apple can be of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 pears can be peach so you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.079
 you can change the fruit that is me 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 in this case I will use the fruit 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.050
 pure that is the fruit that I have bought 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 in clipped and they will see how I have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 done but you can use the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.629
 fruit that comes in can then well 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 It would be much easier because 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.470
 they have to be absolutely almost nothing 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.060
 not only mix it, they're going to see 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.980
 and can combine any fruit 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.510
 extremely easy I hope that you will 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.000
 like it and try to do it at home 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.950
 because he is very rich above all and good 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.390
 having said this now do not forget 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.590
 to subscribe in the bottom part of him 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.810
 is or facebook twitter 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.580

 social networks where you can find me 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 and now we are going to see what it is that 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.870
 We need to make this dessert easy 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:28.830
 4 apples 100 grams of butter without 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.830
 salt and the degree of blond or brown sugar 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.880
 780 grams of the purpose flour 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.480
 first thing we will do is take away the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.020
 heart and peel the apples 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.020
 namely 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.760
 The first thing we will do is place in a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.400
 Pot some water with string and 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.259
 we leave it there until it boils when 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.259
 is boiling we add the manzanitas 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:12.620
 and here we have it so let's add 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.040
 a few spoonfuls of blond sugar 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.040
 and a little 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.890
 remain 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.350
 and if you 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.650
 and now in a container we place the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:40.720
 flour 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:45.189
 the butter a little cinnamon 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.189
 and finally the sugar 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.939
 now you are going to take a fork and we are going to 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:59.900
 mix all this you just have to 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.900
 press a little 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.500
 you have to leave something like that 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.710
 the manzanitas are going to stay something like this 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.780
 caramelized now we are going to place 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.610
 in the bottom of a container 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 anyone in this case I am 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.680
 doing individual and above I'm going to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.650
 place the mixture that I just made 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.069
 I'm going to place the crispy on top of 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.609
 the fruit until it is no longer visible 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.609
 do not 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 remember that you can also do 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.450
 larger presentations combining 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.580
 fruits or from a single fruit you put in the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.350
 container and then on top you place the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.160
 mix in the same way in which 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.160
 we did the little 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 and 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.870
 Now that we have everything, we are going to 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.060
 introduce it in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.060
 for approximately 15 minutes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.629
 an ice cream ball combines perfect 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.830
 and you're ready to enjoy it 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.930

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.949
 you can do with any fruit and you're going 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.949
