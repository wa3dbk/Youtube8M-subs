00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
top here we have the SE 20 then we have

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
top here we have the SE 20 then we have
the<00:01:21.810> SE<00:01:22.200> 30<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.240> finally<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.869> SE<00:01:25.259> 50

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
now all three amps have identical

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.969 
now all three amps have identical
control<00:01:29.400> layouts<00:01:29.990> beginning<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.170> two

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
channels Ali channel a clean channel

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.819 
channels Ali channel a clean channel
both<00:01:35.520> with<00:01:35.759> bright<00:01:36.030> switches<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.829> then

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
both with bright switches and then

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.550 
both with bright switches and then
there's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> global<00:01:38.640> reverb<00:01:39.140> master<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
there's a global reverb master for the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
there's a global reverb master for the
lead<00:01:40.770> channel<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.729> global<00:01:42.150> clean<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.140> the

amplifiers<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.760> suggest<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.840> go<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.049> your

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
amplifiers I suggest that you go to your

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.380 
amplifiers I suggest that you go to your
local<00:03:07.380> dealer<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.099> check<00:03:08.670> each<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:08.970> out

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
local dealer and check each one out

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.089 
local dealer and check each one out
because<00:03:09.720> each<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.319> them<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> very

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
because each one of them have a very

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.240 
because each one of them have a very
distinct<00:03:11.670> tonal<00:03:12.060> character<00:03:12.709> whether<00:03:13.709> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
distinct tonal character whether you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.520 
distinct tonal character whether you
have<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.519> combo<00:03:15.060> or<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.329> head<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.750> cabinet<00:03:16.200> that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
have a combo or a head and cabinet that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800 
have a combo or a head and cabinet that
also<00:03:16.769> ask<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.090> also<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.510> great<00:03:18.780> way

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
also ask that but it's also a great way

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.349 
also ask that but it's also a great way
to<00:03:19.019> check<00:03:19.290> out<00:03:19.500> where<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> 6v6<00:03:20.519> tube<00:03:21.000> sounds

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
to check out where the 6v6 tube sounds

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.110 
to check out where the 6v6 tube sounds
like<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.720> 50<00:03:22.260> 881<00:03:22.620> tube<00:03:23.040> sounds<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.549> or<00:03:23.760> an
