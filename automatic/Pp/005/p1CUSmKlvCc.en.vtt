00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
we get a lot of questions about our

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.490 
we get a lot of questions about our
backline<00:00:13.580> we<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:14.969> Vox<00:00:15.240> ac30<00:00:15.809> s<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
backline we like to use Vox ac30 s and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
backline we like to use Vox ac30 s and
we<00:00:17.039> have<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.279> different<00:00:17.430> types<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:17.939> on<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
we have two different types here on the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.730 
we have two different types here on the
right<00:00:18.509> as<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> Vox<00:00:20.029> ac30<00:00:21.029> CC<00:00:21.660> 2<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
right as a Vox ac30 CC 2 which is the

custom classic and on the left is the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.669 
custom classic and on the left is the
ac30<00:00:26.279> hand-wired<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> head<00:00:27.990> but

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
ac30 hand-wired which is just a head but

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.630 
ac30 hand-wired which is just a head but
we<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.330> speaker<00:00:30.330> cabinet<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.640> two

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
we have a speaker cabinet that is two

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.410 
we have a speaker cabinet that is two
eminence<00:00:33.120> legends<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:35.089> we<00:00:36.089> get<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.269> lot<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
eminence legends and we get a lot of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.910 
eminence legends and we get a lot of
questions<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:36.870> what's<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.379> difference<00:00:37.769> in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
questions about what's the difference in

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.840 
questions about what's the difference in
tone<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:40.010> features<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:41.339> so<00:00:41.519> we<00:00:41.670> thought

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
tone and features on it so we thought

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
tone and features on it so we thought
we'd<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.270> video<00:00:42.539> showing<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
we'd do a little video showing you that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.880 
we'd do a little video showing you that
and<00:00:44.370> we'll<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.450> running<00:00:45.660> both<00:00:46.050> amps<00:00:46.590> through

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and we'll be running both amps through

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.270 
and we'll be running both amps through
the<00:00:47.160> imminence<00:00:47.730> cab<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> tones<00:00:49.949> can

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the imminence cab so that the tones can

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.779 
the imminence cab so that the tones can
be<00:00:50.930> easily<00:00:51.930> comparable<00:00:52.620> alright<00:00:53.489> let's<00:00:53.670> take

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
be easily comparable alright let's take

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
be easily comparable alright let's take
a<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> custom<00:00:54.570> classic<00:00:55.050> first<00:00:55.399> two

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
a look at the custom classic first two

Wharfedale speakers and I'll show you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
Wharfedale speakers and I'll show you
the<00:01:02.539> control<00:01:03.539> panel<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:05.789> your<00:01:06.060> inputs

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the control panel so there's your inputs

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.460 
the control panel so there's your inputs
your<00:01:07.619> normal<00:01:08.220> volume<00:01:08.630> there's<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.899> top

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
your normal volume there's your top

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
your normal volume there's your top
boost<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.160> EQ<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.350> reverb

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
boost and EQ and then we have reverb

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.660 
boost and EQ and then we have reverb
tremolo<00:01:15.240> tone<00:01:16.020> cut<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> master<00:01:17.009> volume<00:01:17.220> wired

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
tremolo tone cut and master volume wired

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
tremolo tone cut and master volume wired
as<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.140> head

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
as you can see it's just a head

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.420 
as you can see it's just a head
but<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> specs<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:22.020> much<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> same

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
but the specs are pretty much the same

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240 
but the specs are pretty much the same
there's<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.500> input<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> normal

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
there's your input for the normal

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
there's your input for the normal
channel<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> there's<00:01:27.299> volume<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
channel and there's volume and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.710 
channel and there's volume and
brilliance<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> bass

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
brilliance and then you also have a bass

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.560 
brilliance and then you also have a bass

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
running either pentode or triode then

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
running either pentode or triode then
you<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.000> input<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.079> top<00:01:40.290> boost

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you have your input for the top boost

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
you have your input for the top boost
channel<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.520> volume<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.180> your<00:01:42.240> eq
