because<00:01:56.700> some<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> our<00:01:57.060> bus<00:01:57.240> trips<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.719> pretty

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
because some of our bus trips are pretty

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069 
because some of our bus trips are pretty
long<00:01:58.560> 15<00:01:59.070> hours<00:01:59.399> or<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.090> we'll<00:02:00.930> have

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
long 15 hours or so I think we'll have

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
long 15 hours or so I think we'll have
something<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.680> long<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
something that are that long so if you

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.370 
something that are that long so if you

want to warm up a snack you can do that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.660 
want to warm up a snack you can do that
little<00:02:05.340> storage<00:02:05.700> area<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.520> much

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
little storage area here don't have much

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
little storage area here don't have much
in<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.149> cuz<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:10.020> didn't<00:02:10.200> travel<00:02:10.349> too

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
in it there cuz we didn't travel too

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.200 
in it there cuz we didn't travel too
heavy<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.069> time

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
heavy this time

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.580 
heavy this time
but<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.660> pawn<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.020> put<00:02:13.140> some<00:02:13.260> food<00:02:13.440> in

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.090 
but if we pawn and put some food in
there<00:02:13.800> or<00:02:13.920> whatever<00:02:14.160> we're<00:02:14.700> able<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
there or whatever we're able to do that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.850 
there or whatever we're able to do that
and<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:17.430> moving<00:02:17.640> back<00:02:17.880> into<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.860> sleeping

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and then moving back into the sleeping

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.730 
and then moving back into the sleeping
section<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.460> guess<00:02:20.780> from<00:02:21.780> majority<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
watch the same thing just kind of cool

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.880 
watch the same thing just kind of cool
and<00:05:45.280> then<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:46.060> final<00:05:46.450> part<00:05:46.600> here<00:05:47.050> we've<00:05:47.740> got

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
and then the final part here we've got

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.770 
and then the final part here we've got
some<00:05:48.100> of<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.280> stuff<00:05:48.340> too<00:05:48.669> I<00:05:49.000> don't<00:05:49.570> know<00:05:49.720> I'm

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
some of the stuff too I don't know I'm

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.440 
some of the stuff too I don't know I'm
not<00:05:49.810> really<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:50.140> tech<00:05:50.410> guy<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:50.860> I<00:05:51.729> guess<00:05:52.210> he<00:05:52.330> can

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
not really a tech guy but I guess he can

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.000 
not really a tech guy but I guess he can
sync<00:05:52.750> everything<00:05:53.020> on<00:05:53.260> the<00:05:53.380> bus<00:05:53.530> or<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:53.860> can

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
sync everything on the bus or you can

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.260 
sync everything on the bus or you can
switch<00:05:54.280> it<00:05:54.310> around<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.850> think<00:05:55.000> he<00:05:55.060> can<00:05:55.150> play

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
switch it around I think he can play

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.940 
switch it around I think he can play
some<00:05:55.510> music<00:05:55.900> back<00:05:56.080> here<00:05:56.350> there's<00:05:56.560> speakers

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
some music back here there's speakers

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.690 
some music back here there's speakers
all<00:05:57.130> over<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.520> place<00:05:59.070> so<00:06:00.070> that's<00:06:00.160> pretty<00:06:00.400> cool

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
all over the place so that's pretty cool

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.020 
all over the place so that's pretty cool
and<00:06:01.000> then<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.360> final<00:06:01.600> bed

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
and then the final bed

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.810 
and then the final bed
we<00:06:04.030> like<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.300> isolate<00:06:04.419> some<00:06:05.200> people<00:06:05.820> first

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
we like to isolate some people first

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.760 
we like to isolate some people first
couple<00:06:07.090> trips<00:06:07.300> it's<00:06:07.510> been<00:06:07.660> with<00:06:07.780> Tala<00:06:07.990> I<00:06:08.289> don't

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
couple trips it's been with Tala I don't

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.840 
couple trips it's been with Tala I don't
think<00:06:08.890> it's<00:06:09.010> been<00:06:09.100> by<00:06:09.220> choice<00:06:09.490> I<00:06:09.640> think<00:06:09.729> the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
think it's been by choice I think the

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.430 
think it's been by choice I think the
team<00:06:10.030> voted<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.450> try<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.750> keep<00:06:10.840> him<00:06:10.960> back<00:06:11.140> and

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
team voted to try and keep him back and

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.290 
team voted to try and keep him back and
we<00:06:11.620> have<00:06:12.190> a<00:06:12.220> rule<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:12.640> he<00:06:12.760> has<00:06:12.880> to<00:06:13.000> keep<00:06:13.120> their

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
we have a rule that he has to keep their

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.779 
we have a rule that he has to keep their
curtain<00:06:13.539> closed<00:06:13.750> at<00:06:13.930> all<00:06:13.990> times<00:06:14.430> he<00:06:15.430> tries<00:06:15.640> to

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
curtain closed at all times he tries to

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.960 
curtain closed at all times he tries to
abused<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.180> sometimes<00:06:16.510> but<00:06:16.660> we<00:06:16.750> keep<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:17.020> middle

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
abused it sometimes but we keep a middle

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.029 
abused it sometimes but we keep a middle
so<00:06:18.970> that's<00:06:19.090> pretty<00:06:19.390> much<00:06:19.510> it<00:06:19.780> that's<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:20.289> spot

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
so that's pretty much it that's the spot

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:22.890 
so that's pretty much it that's the spot
guys<00:06:21.400> will<00:06:21.610> sleep<00:06:21.789> on<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.060> sofas<00:06:22.419> back<00:06:22.630> here
