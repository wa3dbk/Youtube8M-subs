so<00:03:17.590> now<00:03:18.590> I've<00:03:19.579> actually<00:03:20.239> inside<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:20.750> hood

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.699 

it's<00:03:24.349> not<00:03:25.040> very<00:03:25.250> comfortable<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.939> walk<00:03:26.120> around

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
it's not very comfortable to walk around

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.520 
it's not very comfortable to walk around
like<00:03:27.709> standing<00:03:28.459> up<00:03:28.689> straight<00:03:29.689> is<00:03:29.900> difficult

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
like standing up straight is difficult

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.069

and<00:03:32.290> moving<00:03:33.290> around<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:34.040> not<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.579> easy<00:03:35.079> but

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
and moving around is not that easy but

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.009 
and moving around is not that easy but
the<00:03:36.349> thing<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.859> when<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.719> get<00:03:38.719> on<00:03:38.870> the

bike get on to the tax position if we go

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.899 
bike get on to the tax position if we go
