00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.850
 hello to all in today's video I show you 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.860
 how to make the french manicure 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.650
 I know I have let you see in various 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.230
 I have nail art tutorials but I thought 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.510
 to make a specific video 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.119
 dedicated only to the realization 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.039
 of france because I find it anyway 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.140
 it's one of my favorite hands 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.180
 I find it very sophisticated and elegant 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.780
 complete therefore also for those who do not love 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 maybe decorate your nails 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.019
 this, however, makes it our hand 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 particular orderly and above all yes 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.470
 can therefore play with colors 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 it is not necessarily that it must be monotonous 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.330
 white we can that as I did 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.920
 today with the light blue with black and red 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.350
 also very elegant 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 in short, we can indulge ourselves enough 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.409
 even maybe a diamond for 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.019
 embellish it so here I find it to be 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.940
 the perfect manicure and make it with 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.159
 the enamels is not easy I find it is 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.229
 at least in my opinion according to mine 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.820
 manual ability is easier to achieve 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.380
 obviously with the sky because already fin 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 so much so that it does not reach us 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.940
 we have the possibility to modify 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.720
 while here we just lean on 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
 our nails 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 that is what it remains, therefore 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.770
 make an arrow on the laughing 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 because the French are beautiful when 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.030
 they are smiling making a france 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.370
 smiling with the enamels is not 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.710
 very simple and therefore I wanted 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.390
 dedicate a special video I hope very much 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.950
 may be of interest to many of you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.540
 I will also use this video for i 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.940
 next tutorial to speed up 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.760
 the various kidneys the art they will contain 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 of France and nothing I leave you with 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.560
 tutorial I send you a big kiss 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 Hello 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 I spent two bases to perfect the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.340
 color of the minutes then first with a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 antifreeze from collistar to the other one 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.429
 dvd also rose suppa and I get this 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.530
 beautiful natural color 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.810
 surprises the eighteenth century with the accusation with 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.709
 whose heavenly I understand well from the point of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.209
 brush and I go to draw images one 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.390
 first draft of war that will be the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.190
 france i do n't do it straight and flat 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 because the arrow must be smiling 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.790
 as I said, for smiles the more children 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.590
 more beautiful 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.269
 put a little product that time because 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.650
 much later we should go over and over 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.660
 so these would be right for us 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 get an idea I take some paper 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 oven towards plays some glaze drops 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 so in short it takes more time to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.330
 to dry using this 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.970
 brush you find yourself better than you can 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.680
 also use one from the tip more 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.079
 short thinner and I'm fine with 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 this and I'm going to perfect a little bit 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.269
 my france so long the ports 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.280
 video the smile my corners 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.760
 perfection all over the line 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.430
 of mine because there are trade 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 lists of adhesive guide rests for 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.790
 do greece sees it I do not recommend because 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.069
 if you like opinions the other that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.049
 make the arrow on both 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.400
 hands is a great exercise for 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.180
 however one becomes familiar with 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.939
 brush 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.650
 how much pressure to exercise in short 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.230
 I find it really great 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.969
 exercise also because it is still one 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 question of precision because it must 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.230
 in short, to be quite the same if not 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.209
 perfectly equal enough which on 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 all the nails so here I find that 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.700
 is a great basic exercise one 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.829
 once perfected place the nails 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.950
 taken directly the brush of the 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.049
 bottle is like before I go to revise 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.989
 all the myelin in this way 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.519
 I will also go to cover to camouflage with the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.810
 streaks that are created with the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:53.970
 precision brush and then 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.970
 obviously with up almost every medium 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.620
 it can happen to touch a little bit the 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.990
 skin around the nail with color 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.180
 can intervene with a university regis 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.810
 malto I am using that of 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.670
 hamas 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.800
 this is an operation I do 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.420
 in the end because so at least a little passes 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.660
 of time and the enamel started 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.870
 dry problem that more time passes 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.430
 less time in between 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.080
 will eventually use the enamel for 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 dry if we put motivated filtered 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.970
 together I leave good life 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.770
 pass another two minutes and passed 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.510
 then listen to the reborn here I am 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.830
 using that of is without a 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.300
 apparently they are taking off the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.340
 trade for my great sorrow 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.320
 I think but applied a top coat 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.120
 the important thing is that it is a top coat and not 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.760
 a clear nail polish if you want you can 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.410
 apply even two coats or this is 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.890
 everything will be saying fabio profits not a 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.310
 big kiss 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.310
 Hello
