review the buoy Dad the buoy dad
detangling<00:00:10.920> comb<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:12.059> comb<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.840> massive<00:00:13.620> if

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
detangling comb this comb is massive if

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
detangling comb this comb is massive if
you<00:00:13.980> look<00:00:14.219> I'll<00:00:14.490> put<00:00:14.670> my<00:00:14.759> finger<00:00:15.120> next<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.480> it

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you look I'll put my finger next to it

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
you look I'll put my finger next to it
and<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.529> see<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.609> width<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and you can see that the width of this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.310 
and you can see that the width of this
is<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:19.650> inch<00:00:20.449> yeah<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.960> definitely<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:23.070> inch

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
is an inch yeah it's definitely an inch

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.670 
is an inch yeah it's definitely an inch
yeah<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.189> that's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.060> very<00:00:27.300> thick<00:00:28.080> comb<00:00:28.410> when

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
yeah so that's a very thick comb when

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
yeah so that's a very thick comb when
you<00:00:28.769> consider<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> average<00:00:30.029> comb<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you consider that the average comb is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.799 
you consider that the average comb is
probably<00:00:31.650> closer<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.669> eighth<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:33.660> inch

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
probably closer to an eighth of an inch

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.810 
probably closer to an eighth of an inch
maybe<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.860> quarter-inch<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> comb<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
maybe a quarter-inch this comb is

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.750 
maybe a quarter-inch this comb is
massive<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> teeth<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.710> massive

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
massive the teeth on it are massive

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
massive the teeth on it are massive
the<00:00:42.000> teeth<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.570> wider<00:00:43.050> than<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:44.040> average

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the teeth are wider than your average

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.770 
the teeth are wider than your average
comb<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.350> double<00:00:46.770> row<00:00:47.039> comb

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
comb there and it's a double row comb

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
comb there and it's a double row comb
which<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> good<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.500> detangling<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.730> comb

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
which is good for detangling this comb

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
which is good for detangling this comb
is<00:00:51.300> heavy<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:53.250> has<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:54.090> nice<00:00:54.690> handle<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is heavy it has a nice handle on it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.430 
is heavy it has a nice handle on it
there<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.250> grab<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.059> comb<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
there you grab that comb like that and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
there you grab that comb like that and
in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.890> shower<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.940> comb<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.510> goes

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
in the shower this comb just goes

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
in the shower this comb just goes
through<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.530> hair<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.980> weight<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.670> hair

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
through my hair the weight of this hair

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
through my hair the weight of this hair
works<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.339> detangles<00:01:06.119> my

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
works with the water and it detangles my

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
works with the water and it detangles my
hair<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.430> effectively<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.260> braid<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hair so effectively now I had a braid in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
hair so effectively now I had a braid in
my<00:01:11.369> hair<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.869> down<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:15.680> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
my hair that I put down here and this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
my hair that I put down here and this
cone<00:01:17.509> actually<00:01:18.509> comb<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.860> braid<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.060> my

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cone actually comb that braid out of my

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
cone actually comb that braid out of my
hair<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
hair just now that's just how good of a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
hair just now that's just how good of a
detangler<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.470> important

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
detangler it is and that's important

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
detangler it is and that's important
because<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.490> hair<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> ringlets<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> curl

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because my hair is in ringlets to curl

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
because my hair is in ringlets to curl
around<00:01:28.530> itself<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> need<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
around itself and what I need is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
around itself and what I need is
something<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:32.070> remove<00:01:32.670> those

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
something that will remove those

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.510 
something that will remove those
ringlets<00:01:33.509> effectively<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> detangle<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
ringlets effectively and detangle and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.080 
ringlets effectively and detangle and
just<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.450> thought<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.890> did<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.430> my

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just as I thought this one did it in my

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.670 
just as I thought this one did it in my
previous<00:01:39.829> videos<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.130> cones<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:42.750> using<00:01:43.110> on

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
previous videos on cones I was using on

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
previous videos on cones I was using on
my<00:01:43.740> Mason<00:01:44.460> Pearson<00:01:44.729> combs<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.570> gotten

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
my Mason Pearson combs that I've gotten

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.850 
my Mason Pearson combs that I've gotten
in<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.200> great<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> comes<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
in there great but when it comes to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.609 
in there great but when it comes to
detangling<00:01:50.149> this<00:01:51.149> comb<00:01:51.540> even<00:01:52.110> though<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> has

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
detangling this comb even though it has

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.219 
detangling this comb even though it has
seams<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.549> wish<00:01:53.820> they<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.750> model

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
seams and I wish they would make a model

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.120 
seams and I wish they would make a model
with<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.340> handmade<00:01:56.820> without<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.780> scenes

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
with that is handmade without the scenes

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
with that is handmade without the scenes
this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> seen<00:01:59.790> comb<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.899> due<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this is a seen comb but due to the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.209 
this is a seen comb but due to the
weight<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> Komen<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.329> again<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.320> tend<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
weight of the Komen and again I tend to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.969 
weight of the Komen and again I tend to
hold<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.670> combs<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> hold<00:02:07.710> my

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hold my combs like this so I hold my

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.729 
hold my combs like this so I hold my
combs<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.550> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.879> military<00:02:09.119> style<00:02:09.840> often

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
combs in a kind of military style often

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.450 
combs in a kind of military style often
times<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.300> right<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.720> there

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
times so I get right in there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.490 
times so I get right in there
and<00:02:15.020> I'm<00:02:16.020> applying<00:02:16.140> tension<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.500> I'm

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and I'm applying tension here and I'm

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.180 
and I'm applying tension here and I'm
going<00:02:19.740> slowly<00:02:20.810> over<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.960> hair<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.040> it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
going slowly over the hair so that it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
going slowly over the hair so that it
gives<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.640> time<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.240> work<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:25.080> tangles<00:02:25.800> now

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
gives it a time to work out tangles now

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.240
