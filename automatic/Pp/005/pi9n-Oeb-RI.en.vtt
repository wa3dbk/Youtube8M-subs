00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
can really see it the engine almost

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.130 
can really see it the engine almost
responds<00:03:06.180> almost<00:03:06.600> not<00:03:06.720> quite<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.110> almost

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
responds almost not quite but almost

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.960 
responds almost not quite but almost
responds<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.519> normally<00:03:08.940> aspirated

this<00:03:14.100> video<00:03:14.250> started<00:03:15.019> does<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.739> ats-v

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
this video started does this the ats-v

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.210 
this video started does this the ats-v
really<00:03:18.090> take<00:03:18.299> on<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.660> bmw<00:03:19.200> m3<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
really take on the bmw m3 and the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.560 
really take on the bmw m3 and the
mercedes<00:03:20.640> AMG<00:03:20.700> c63s<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:22.350> its<00:03:23.190> own<00:03:23.340> turf<00:03:23.610> the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.000 
mercedes AMG c63s on its own turf the
answer<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.989> yes<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.500> really<00:03:25.650> does

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
answer is yes it really does

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.479 
answer is yes it really does
unlike<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.030> CTSV<00:03:27.480> before<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.680> ats-v<00:03:29.100> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
unlike the CTSV before it the ats-v is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.490 
unlike the CTSV before it the ats-v is
smaller<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:30.269> more<00:03:30.329> compact<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.110> it's<00:03:31.290> more

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
smaller it's more compact and it's more

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.319 
smaller it's more compact and it's more
directly<00:03:32.220> aimed<00:03:32.400> at<00:03:32.700> those<00:03:32.970> German
