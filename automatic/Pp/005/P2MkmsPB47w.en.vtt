00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.500
 working in the market 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.020
 for some still a dream for others and the daily reality it seems 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.499
 all so nice, but working in the market remains a profession in itself 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.590
 autonomous half of the start-ups and once again helping each other 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.589
 mainly through moderate preparation 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.300
 The goal is the successful French fries stall. He is also the chairman of the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.499
 the local department of the CV to her in dordrecht 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.860
 He did talk about coming and going 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.590
 I think it will stop within a year because of the expectation pattern 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.489
 gone from 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.870
 my chance to come to the market that you are right and a good one a good one 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 van runs a bit 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.150
 ir is proven that you 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.000
 certainly on a parking year 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 build up a regular clientele a little bit and must stand for at least two years 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.400
 the that people really know because it's really from 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.700
 have faith in dnb in the merchant 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.110
 7 versatility in the market is very important to the people 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.989
 can find everything 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.680
 just the lack of the han say that the service immediately still have 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 for example, on the market a barber with a free kick is not on the market in the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 sales car 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.690
 I think that kind of innovation 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.180
 all beginnings are difficult 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.290
 the question is of course how to avoid these startup problems 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.170
 he should at least be the quality price ratio 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.880
 he should pay attention to opener ok thatcher his appearance say 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.240
 and good looks that it went and neat that we looked after that cared 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580
 the most guts 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.290
 that he is interested in the consumer in the customer who wants to be with him 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.340
 you have to build a bond with your customers 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.530
 and if you just started it is ready to work hard 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.200
 but the market copies would not want all people 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.189
 poelmann we keep dropping nice talk with people I just want nice 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.200
 the nice trek when I was no longer above the stadium 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 tell me what i mean i decide what i do 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.740
 the Greek government 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.950
 so also nice market and through 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880
 geert wilders made known that states 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.319
 yes that is something you always keep in mind the industry incident 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 for mine 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:18.459
 look for more information on seven years of fetching.and any and of course brands 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 on the market 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.429
