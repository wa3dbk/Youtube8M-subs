00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
palette I believe it came with an

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.880 
palette I believe it came with an
eyeliner<00:01:50.030> me<00:01:50.510> personally<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.410> would<00:01:51.740> have

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
eyeliner me personally I would have

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.220 
eyeliner me personally I would have
preferred<00:01:52.070> an<00:01:52.820> eyeliner<00:01:53.480> but<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.780> makeup<00:01:54.110> brush

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
preferred an eyeliner but a makeup brush

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.720
