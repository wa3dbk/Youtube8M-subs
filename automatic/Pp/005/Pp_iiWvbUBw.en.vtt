middle and a char is going aggressive
yeah<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.660> could<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.900> bad<00:00:19.140> news<00:00:19.199> because

as<00:00:21.660> well<00:00:21.810> honey<00:00:22.380> we'll<00:00:22.710> come<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.010> tactics

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
as well honey we'll come down tactics

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.760 
as well honey we'll come down tactics
yes<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.600> should<00:00:24.779> imagine<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.230> actually<00:00:25.680> it's

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
yes I should imagine so actually it's

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.019 
yes I should imagine so actually it's
just<00:00:25.920> miss<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> ultimate<00:00:26.550> down<00:00:26.730> there<00:00:26.910> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
just miss the ultimate down there but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.090 
just miss the ultimate down there but
Charu<00:00:27.300> I'm<00:00:27.720> pre-law<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.619> head-to-head<00:00:28.949> in

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
Charu I'm pre-law going head-to-head in

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.060 
Charu I'm pre-law going head-to-head in
this<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.699> there<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.539> move<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.439> RNA

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
this one but there is the move from RNA

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
this one but there is the move from RNA
or<00:00:32.220> guessing<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.910> might<00:00:33.059> maybe<00:00:33.239> wait<00:00:33.540> for

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
or guessing it might maybe wait for

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
or guessing it might maybe wait for
McCarthy<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> come<00:00:34.800> play<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> fear<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> on

McCarthy to come play the fear is on
here<00:00:36.030> comes<00:00:36.180> RNA

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
here comes RNA

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.940 
here comes RNA
well<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.170> gonna<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:37.829> they
