box<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:38.280> pretty<00:00:38.520> big<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.430> bigger<00:00:41.430> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
box just pretty big it's a bigger it

box just pretty big it's a bigger it
seems<00:00:42.180> bigger<00:00:42.690> than<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.770> got

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
seems bigger than the one that I got

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.290 
seems bigger than the one that I got
with<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.160> American<00:00:44.700> Airlines<00:00:45.230> 737<00:00:47.180> being<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
with my American Airlines 737 being that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.400 
with my American Airlines 737 being that
the<00:00:48.390> planes<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> same<00:00:49.170> size<00:00:49.350> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the planes about the same size but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.880 
the planes about the same size but
here's<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> actual<00:00:50.129> plane<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.350> model

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here's the actual plane so this model

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
here's the actual plane so this model
comes<00:00:53.309> with<00:00:53.489> six<00:00:54.059> interchangeable<00:00:54.989> tails

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
comes with six interchangeable tails

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.459 
comes with six interchangeable tails
which<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.370> nice<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.960> problems

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
which is very nice but I had problems

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
which is very nice but I had problems
with<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.859> line<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.910> vertical

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
with my line with my vertical

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.100 
with my line with my vertical
stabilizers<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.910> only<00:01:03.149> put

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
stabilizers these so I could only put

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
stabilizers these so I could only put
one<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.729> kind<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
one in because like a thing kind of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
one in because like a thing kind of
broke<00:01:06.240> off<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.439> get

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
broke off and the way that you can get

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
broke off and the way that you can get
the<00:01:07.740> actual<00:01:07.860> tail<00:01:08.700> fin<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.180> take<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.439> off

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the actual tail fin just take to get off

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.760 
the actual tail fin just take to get off
is<00:01:10.890> by<00:01:11.700> uh<00:01:12.049> basically<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.380> fit<00:01:13.650> together

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
is by uh basically they all fit together
