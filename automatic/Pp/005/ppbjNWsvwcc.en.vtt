00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
metal blanks into these tracks I'm just

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.020 
metal blanks into these tracks I'm just
going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> put<00:00:44.660> get<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> idea<00:00:46.520> some<00:00:47.520> jars<00:00:47.789> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
going to put get the idea some jars in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.380 
going to put get the idea some jars in
here

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
here

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
here
and<00:00:48.539> once<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> line<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.350> loaded<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> operator

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and once a line is loaded the operator

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.049 
and once a line is loaded the operator
would<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:50.879> feed<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> forward<00:00:52.910> they<00:00:53.910> would

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
would then feed it forward they would

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.990 
would then feed it forward they would
load<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.340> something<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
load it up this would be something you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.479 
load it up this would be something you
might<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.170> night<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.620> night<00:00:58.890> before<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
might do the night at night before you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.240 
might do the night at night before you
were<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.609> home<00:01:00.030> setting<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.250> loading

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
were going home setting this up loading

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.950 
were going home setting this up loading
this<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.879> you've<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.690> all

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this up now you've actually get this all

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500 
this up now you've actually get this all
completely<00:01:04.409> loaded<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.100> until<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> parts<00:01:06.390> are

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
completely loaded in until the parts are

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.390 
completely loaded in until the parts are
running<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> other<00:01:07.170> end<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.680> that's

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
running at the other end and that's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210 
running at the other end and that's
where<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.930> robot<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.830> control

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
where your your robot or your control

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
where your your robot or your control
systems<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.000> pick<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.220> once

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
systems going to pick it up and once

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789 
systems going to pick it up and once
it's<00:01:14.430> processed<00:01:14.869> let<00:01:15.869> me<00:01:15.960> take<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it's processed let me take it out of the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.910 
it's processed let me take it out of the
machine<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.189> placed<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.330> conveyor

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
machine and placed on this top conveyor

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.130 
machine and placed on this top conveyor
where<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> run<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> accumulate

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
where to run down and accumulate

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.270 
where to run down and accumulate
hopefully<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> right

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
hopefully we get that down to the right

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
hopefully we get that down to the right
now<00:01:23.460> both<00:01:23.670> systems<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.240> variable<00:01:24.659> speed<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
now both systems are variable speed and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.480 
now both systems are variable speed and
they<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.310> operated<00:01:26.520> by<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.229> standard

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
they can be operated by the standard

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
they can be operated by the standard
controllers<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> robots<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
controllers that are on the robots to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.980 
controllers that are on the robots to
turn<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.040> historically<00:01:32.820> stop<00:01:33.150> them<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
turn them on historically stop them so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.310 
turn them on historically stop them so
you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.200> basically<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.320> signal

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you can basically do this with a signal

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.550 
you can basically do this with a signal
teletype

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
teletype

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.800 
teletype
seconds<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.640> again<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.360> guy<00:01:40.540> in<00:01:40.600> real

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
seconds and again that the guy in real

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.289 
seconds and again that the guy in real
systems<00:01:40.990> are<00:01:41.290> going<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.530> customer<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:43.150> this

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
systems are going to be customer so this

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.859 
systems are going to be customer so this
would<00:01:43.450> now<00:01:43.570> be<00:01:43.750> sitting<00:01:44.140> here<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:45.040> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
would now be sitting here and as the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.390 
would now be sitting here and as the
parts<00:01:46.869> are<00:01:47.049> needed<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.799> robots<00:01:48.159> going<00:01:48.280> to

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
parts are needed the robots going to

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030 
parts are needed the robots going to
take<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:49.380> process<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.590> through<00:01:50.830> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
take one process it through the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.850 
take one process it through the
machinery<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.630> you<00:01:52.690> get<00:01:52.869> rid<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.590> come

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
machinery and you get rid of it and come

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.730 
machinery and you get rid of it and come
and<00:01:53.979> take<00:01:54.100> another<00:01:54.430> one<00:01:55.170> process<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.350> get<00:01:56.590> rid

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
and take another one process it get rid

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.190 
and take another one process it get rid
of<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.979> maybe<00:01:57.700> put<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.270> us<00:01:58.390> directly<00:01:58.869> above

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
of it maybe put it to us directly above

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.710 
of it maybe put it to us directly above
here<00:01:59.380> once<00:01:59.649> it's<00:01:59.800> done<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> may<00:02:01.180> be<00:02:01.210> minutes

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
here once it's done so it may be minutes

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.600 
here once it's done so it may be minutes
or<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.140> long<00:02:02.590> time<00:02:02.890> depends<00:02:03.190> on<00:02:03.280> how<00:02:03.399> long<00:02:03.549> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
or a long time depends on how long a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.420 
or a long time depends on how long a
process<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.390> machining<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.979> eventually

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
process is for machining and eventually

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.800 
process is for machining and eventually
all<00:02:06.670> these<00:02:06.940> parts<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.450> going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.659> come<00:02:07.780> down

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
all these parts are going to come down
