00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 mega to death the gamer world your way 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.150
 some scientists have discovered things 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.130
 somewhat interesting face that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.380
 can change some of our 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.590
 everyday if from security 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 maybe of banks and things like that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 maybe even more ahead you can even 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
 to apply in video games I do not know who knows 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 you more my vision 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 there are only some studies that the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.109
 human brain that is the following they 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.949
 have put some some people 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.430
 volunteers would be the guinea pigs to read 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 some acronyms and with that they were 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.719
 monitoring brain waves 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 people as they read such silas and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 face they realized that every time they 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.879
 you you an acronym 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.570
 your brain give a different answer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 for each it would be different and so it is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.200
 messages to the brain were 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 totally different from all other 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 callers the same acronyms 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.340
 they covered with that the brain 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.449
 emits and manages to send some waves 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 brain totally private logical 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 perhaps a brain impression that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.180
 could be a substitution of the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.439
 fingerprint 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.790
 so they were able to put 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.650
 identity have been able to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 identity because from each of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.020
 to celebrate to is according to acronyms 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.350
 who limited there and get a total of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.280
 94 percent accuracy in that then 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.229
 began to research a very thing 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.299
 big that may really deserve some 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.939
 most important thing because it thinks only 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 This shows you that with the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 fingerprint you can not have anything 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 also because it is not to place the public notice 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.689
 It will be that forever. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.909
 You can change your impression. 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.439
 digital but this part given the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.689
 cerebral he can have an alteration 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.259
 that if someone can cheat yours and 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.880
 such 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 Can you make a change to that? 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 to pay for the previous and 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.750
 managed to get out more safely is a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 little confusing if you think about it, but it's a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.670
 Interesting interesting thing you are 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 evolving in some ways that people 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.710
 I could not imagine if I could have 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.590
 a brain impression a wave 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.899
 brains that only you can 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.020
 interesting issue is that we leave 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.020
 mega death the gamer world your way
