theory<00:00:31.919> researchers<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.669> MIT<00:00:32.940> monitored<00:00:33.539> the

brains of rats they found that a rat's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
brains of rats they found that a rat's
brain<00:00:35.430> activity<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.120> identical<00:00:36.510> while<00:00:36.780> both

brain activity was identical while both

brain activity was identical while both
awake<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> asleep<00:00:37.680> meaning<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.609> they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
awake and asleep meaning that they

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.790 
awake and asleep meaning that they
dreamed<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> day's<00:00:39.629> events<00:00:40.170> sure<00:00:40.440> rats

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
dreamed about the day's events sure rats

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.529 
dreamed about the day's events sure rats
and<00:00:41.039> cats<00:00:41.190> are<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.730> different<00:00:41.969> species

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
and cats are very different species

and cats are very different species
however<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.379> study<00:00:43.620> leads<00:00:44.010> researchers<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
however this study leads researchers to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.009 
however this study leads researchers to
believe<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.300> mammals<00:00:45.750> dream

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019
