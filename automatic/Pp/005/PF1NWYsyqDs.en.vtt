hey<00:00:00.390> it's<00:00:00.599> III<00:00:00.960> put<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.230> life<00:00:01.410> today<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:01.949> a

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.300 
hey it's III put in life today with a

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey it's III put in life today with a
somewhat<00:00:03.300> interesting<00:00:03.810> video<00:00:04.080> regarding<00:00:04.620> a

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
somewhat interesting video regarding a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.509 
somewhat interesting video regarding a
scale<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.430> two<00:00:06.299> plus<00:00:06.540> two<00:00:06.569> cubes<00:00:08.300> yep<00:00:09.300> um<00:00:10.519> so

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
scale and two plus two cubes yep um so

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.120 
scale and two plus two cubes yep um so
these<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:12.059> two<00:00:12.090> plastics<00:00:12.780> cubes<00:00:13.590> printed<00:00:13.980> at

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
these are two plastics cubes printed at

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.410 
these are two plastics cubes printed at
one<00:00:14.429> hundred<00:00:14.490> percent<00:00:14.700> infill<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.299> they're

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
one hundred percent infill so they're

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.019 
one hundred percent infill so they're
solid<00:00:15.719> plastic<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.859> density<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.250> pla<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> i

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
solid plastic the density of pla is i

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.929 
solid plastic the density of pla is i
believe<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.359> 1.1<00:00:19.050> grams<00:00:19.260> per<00:00:19.500> century<00:00:19.939> this

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
believe about 1.1 grams per century this

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
believe about 1.1 grams per century this
is<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> little<00:00:21.270> half<00:00:21.449> inch<00:00:21.600> cube<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.340> inch

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
is a little half inch cube the one inch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
is a little half inch cube the one inch
keeping<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> reason<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.150> went<00:00:24.330> empirical<00:00:24.930> even

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
keeping the reason I went empirical even

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.679 
keeping the reason I went empirical even
though<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> hated<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> good<00:00:27.240> reason<00:00:27.390> I'll

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
though I hated is for a good reason I'll

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.980 
though I hated is for a good reason I'll
show<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> minute<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> let's<00:00:30.689> look<00:00:30.869> at

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
show you in a minute so let's look at

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
show you in a minute so let's look at
this<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.380> key<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> half<00:00:32.219> inch<00:00:32.460> cube

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
this little key this is a half inch cube

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
this little key this is a half inch cube
so<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> math<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:34.140> many

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
so you can do the math for how many

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
so you can do the math for how many
cubic<00:00:34.620> centimeters<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> I've<00:00:36.059> no<00:00:36.239> clue

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
cubic centimeters that is I've no clue

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.319 
cubic centimeters that is I've no clue
what<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.770> by<00:00:37.980> weight<00:00:38.329> it's

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
what it is but going by weight it's

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.150 
what it is but going by weight it's
about<00:00:39.660> 2.3<00:00:40.649> 2.4<00:00:41.280> grams<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.829> cubic

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
about 2.3 2.4 grams so about two cubic

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.520 
about 2.3 2.4 grams so about two cubic
centimeters<00:00:44.579> let's<00:00:44.789> say<00:00:45.500> this<00:00:46.500> big<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.950> here

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
centimeters let's say this big one here

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.360 
centimeters let's say this big one here
weighs<00:00:50.210> 16<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> half<00:00:51.449> grams<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> that's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
weighs 16 and a half grams so that's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
weighs 16 and a half grams so that's
closer<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.180> four<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> fourteen<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
closer to what four to fourteen or

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.139 
closer to what four to fourteen or
fifteen<00:00:55.800> 15<00:00:56.610> cubic<00:00:56.940> centimeters<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.000> these

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
fifteen 15 cubic centimeters and these

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.970 
fifteen 15 cubic centimeters and these
these<00:01:00.420> feel<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:01.079> hefty<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.829> got

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
these feel pretty hefty like they got

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
these feel pretty hefty like they got
some<00:01:02.219> weight<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> reason<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
some weight to it but the reason for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
some weight to it but the reason for
this<00:01:03.960> video<00:01:04.290> hopefully<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.920> didn't<00:01:05.220> turn<00:01:05.610> it

anybody to notice in this lifetime so
yeah<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.070> literally<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.180> cube<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
yeah it's literally just a cube of

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.499 
yeah it's literally just a cube of
tungsten<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.770> mass<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.610> insane<00:01:39.060> coming

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
tungsten but mass of it is insane coming

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.910 
tungsten but mass of it is insane coming
back<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.990> little<00:01:40.350> guy<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> half

back to this little guy this is a half

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.310 
back to this little guy this is a half
inch<00:01:41.130> cube<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.990> actually<00:01:43.229> have

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
inch cube they have they actually have

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.450 
inch cube they have they actually have
three<00:01:43.439> versions<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
three versions right now they have a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
three versions right now they have a
half<00:01:44.670> inch<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.210> inch<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.810> inch

half inch to one inch and a two inch

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.510 
half inch to one inch and a two inch
cube<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.770> printing<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> two-inch

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
cube but I'm not printing a two-inch

cube but I'm not printing a two-inch
keep<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> plastic<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> huge<00:01:48.960> waste<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
keep of plastic that's a huge waste so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
keep of plastic that's a huge waste so
yeah<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.040> got<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.250> half-inch<00:01:53.640> keep<00:01:54.290> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
yeah so we got this half-inch keep it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.639 
yeah so we got this half-inch keep it

pain now this little cube is the one

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.120 
pain now this little cube is the one
that<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.269> currently<00:03:44.390> getting<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:45.410> 24<00:03:45.890> bucks

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
that I'm currently getting it's 24 bucks

so<00:03:46.310> not<00:03:46.489> really<00:03:46.670> too<00:03:46.940> bad<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:48.200> big<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.829> 69

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
so not really too bad the big one is 69

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.580 
so not really too bad the big one is 69
which<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.180> quite<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.630> bit<00:03:50.840> more<00:03:50.989> expensive<00:03:51.290> but

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
which is quite a bit more expensive but

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.979 
which is quite a bit more expensive but
I<00:03:52.459> am<00:03:52.579> really<00:03:53.060> tempted<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.480> go<00:03:53.570> for<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.900> because

I am really tempted to go for it because

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.020 
I am really tempted to go for it because
looking<00:03:54.350> at<00:03:54.440> this<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:55.160> size<00:03:55.370> difference<00:03:55.670> is

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
looking at this the size difference is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.699 
looking at this the size difference is
huge<00:03:56.360> of<00:03:56.720> course<00:03:56.750> there's<00:03:57.140> there's<00:03:57.500> eight<00:03:57.680> of

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
huge of course there's there's eight of

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.220 
huge of course there's there's eight of
these<00:03:57.950> little<00:03:58.250> down<00:03:58.370> big<00:03:58.850> one<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.959> it's<00:03:59.989> kind

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
these little down big one but it's kind

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.660 
these little down big one but it's kind
of<00:04:00.260> hard<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.470> put<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.010> in<00:04:01.100> perspective<00:04:01.220> in

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
of hard to put that in perspective in

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.120 
of hard to put that in perspective in
your<00:04:01.790> head<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.959> holding<00:04:03.380> these<00:04:03.500> cubes<00:04:03.920> of

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
your head but holding these cubes of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.979 
your head but holding these cubes of
course<00:04:04.519> this<00:04:04.730> bigger<00:04:05.000> one<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.420> much<00:04:05.720> more

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
course this bigger one is much more

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.770 
course this bigger one is much more
significant<00:04:06.590> than<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:07.489> guy<00:04:07.970> both<00:04:08.450> would<00:04:08.660> be

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
significant than this guy both would be

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.050 
significant than this guy both would be
cool<00:04:08.959> both<00:04:09.260> are<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:10.340> same<00:04:10.519> densities<00:04:11.030> of

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
cool both are of the same densities of

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.660 
cool both are of the same densities of
course<00:04:11.390> sink<00:04:11.780> terial<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.739> both<00:04:13.070> would<00:04:13.340> feel

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
course sink terial so both would feel

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.310 
course sink terial so both would feel
extremely<00:04:14.239> heavy<00:04:14.600> when<00:04:14.810> you're<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.110> picking

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
extremely heavy when you're just picking

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.830 
extremely heavy when you're just picking
them<00:04:15.530> up<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:16.609> this<00:04:16.729> one<00:04:16.970> would<00:04:17.180> be<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:17.600> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
them up but this one would be just so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.380 
them up but this one would be just so
much<00:04:17.959> heavier<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:19.000> think<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.060> would<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.239> lot

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
much heavier I think it would be a lot

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.330 
much heavier I think it would be a lot
cooler<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:21.229> I'm<00:04:21.349> very<00:04:21.590> tempted

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
cooler so I'm very tempted

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.450 
cooler so I'm very tempted
you<00:04:22.400> did<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.570> go<00:04:23.810> be<00:04:23.840> with<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:25.280> one

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
you did this go be with this the one

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.600 
you did this go be with this the one
inch<00:04:25.610> cube<00:04:26.000> if<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.050> guys<00:04:27.290> have<00:04:27.470> any<00:04:27.620> input<00:04:28.250> on

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
inch cube if you guys have any input on

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.670 
inch cube if you guys have any input on
this<00:04:28.790> little<00:04:29.000> conundrum<00:04:29.419> feel<00:04:30.169> free<00:04:30.470> to

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680

there<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.300> purchasing<00:04:35.780> yourself<00:04:36.080> won't<00:04:36.229> let

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
there and purchasing yourself won't let

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.230 
there and purchasing yourself won't let
