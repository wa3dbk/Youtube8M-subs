00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.119
 Tell me, who are you talking about? 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.310
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.670
 and today's video a gameplay 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 of mw2 and today I'm looking at this post 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.079
 because it always has 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.140
 some comrade doing exchange-trading there 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.390
 wanting to start the fun and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
 the joy of others but for me to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 happiness or unhappiness I did not find 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 no comrade law is and as you know 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.789
 the comrades are making exchange-trades 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.590
 staff because not exchange exchange in life 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.289
 Real is that comrade down here. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.440
 those others go there and pimba the rock 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.059
 scheme of the other, let's say so and here in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.379
 game is not that the guys in the games either 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 make exchange-trades to win 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.480
 Emblematic camouflage call nook and by 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 then the thing more or less is going and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.730
 this ends up spoiling in some way the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 sharing and the fun of others 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.830
 Thank god nobody was doing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.530
 that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 so I did not need to stay, and I did not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.570
 worried about hunting these famous 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.010
 busters spoils pleasures and I just 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.400
 able to play in a very cool way 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.230
 and there is nothing better nothing better nothing to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.240
 people play half time so see you 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.010
 not alone is the free for all the guys 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 was a very interesting modality 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.640
 cool 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 the only free noise for all is that at 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.480
 Sometimes it can roll, let's say a little 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.570
 Let's say even more 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.190
 on this map and mw2 is that the staff at 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.080
 sometimes insists on staying in that little house. 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.820
 I was finally dying because 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.830
 Because it's a house it has a good 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.860
 view of the battlefield field from the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.600
 map and the staff will always be there when 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 happens the crowd is always waiting 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.890
 to kill and even more that is a point of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.330
 very close contact with 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 your opponents 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.230
 I ended up in this game always trying 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.910
 get one if you have a paper well 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.100
 interesting in that situation in that 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.200
 part but in some parts ended up 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.020
 dying in time that I left the faces 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.940
 giant kick me there I had to 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 make a spin play with a little bit 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.920
 to get out of the intelligence is to get 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.050
 some random paths 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 say of this house for more or 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.710
 less to one disputed in the enemies 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.730
 able to do this in most of the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.370
 departures 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 of this game but some parts I ended up 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.170
 kind of being surprised surprised 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 by the opponent and who has a 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.019
 cool head slowly taking of 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.480
 a head shot at my enemy's head 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.879
 guys this gun here guys is a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.049
 vector I is not a very gun like 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.150
 I believe 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.670
 you must have seen seen until today 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.980
 perhaps a few matches and even 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.540
 people playing with that gun because she 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 live a way let's say so 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.069
 interesting it is not the best weapon of the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 sunshine coast up to much better weapons 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.150
 than her there but this is a way 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.840
 interesting because she has one was well 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.730
 high 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.019
 only that what happens as she has a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.910
 you're very loud 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.340
 she can kill fast kill a lot 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.049
 well, with that, that very ammunition 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.239
 quickly and with that you end up having 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.250
 that use port iscap of power 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.980
 recover ammunition and something else 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.470
 nice of her that you are interesting you 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.840
 is using his prayer a silencer that 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.180
 putin of them in well retinha with that you 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.829
 can make a riff and even 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.049
 charm killing the enemies in a way 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.480
 very cool because the shots are going 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.260
 well aligned they did not spread much 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.269
 so this helps a lot 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 I'm going to take advantage of this match, the staff 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.230
 leaves her in the background 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.780
 while you check she did not talk about 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.060
 some randomness personal always 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.220
 I'm wondering half a kilo as the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.859
 headset microphone ear hear that 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.919
 you use to play an accident a live 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.599
 Good people, I've already said this in some 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.430
 videos but I do not mind repeating 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.319
 because always good always enough 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.419
 new and personal writing sometimes ends 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.849
 not conferring on that old video and 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.650
 so they are you are connected through 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.180
 while hospitalized but before we 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.569
 start let me tell you a situation here 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.220
 O 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.870
 I shot the guy did not want to kill him. 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.090
 had been without commercial 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.790
 stabbed and then another comrade arrived and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 rolled a bitch half jenner 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.239
 generalized and I do not know what 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.739
 happened there in which the knife locks 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.150
 but it continues to be my lady 's 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.490
 adversary 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.229
 I just managed to kill him and it went well 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.449
 fun was a situation that left me 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.729
 very apprehensive but what the heck 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.610
 sure of what happened 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.910
 Good guys, the phone I use is a little 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.030
 20 fish clinton is a good phone 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.100
 but on playstation 3 and mw3 it does not 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.960
 It works great audio quality 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.690
 It's bad and you can not hear 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.850
 the steps of people of the declared type 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.120
 thus a region of those well 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.389
 in xbox 360 works great and also 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.410
 in old things with 45 mw 2 and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.300
 black ops 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.440
 you get a pretty cool idea of 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.240
 where do your children also come from? 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.570
 foes the footsteps you get 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 listen to a really cool way and help help 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.520
 even if you play can answer 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.350
 Until I understand, I believe and you will understand. 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.120
 that in this match that had more parts 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.220
 I was kind of stopped because I was 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.169
 Looking for me, I should not have been looking 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.720
 enemies was kind of trying to 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.820
 guide the sound and can do this 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.160
 in some other parts unfortunately 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.680
 not because a very unpleasant thing 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.419
 it is also that the code it ends up leaving 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.820
 that guitar noise of the game 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.650
 other noises of shots the noises of the 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.139
 own game itself ended up leaving 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.659
 mix together with people's space 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.400
 and this ends up irritating me so you have 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.949
 which sometimes decreases can not use 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.710
 the phone is too loud because besides you 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.150
 is listening to steps is the game the shots and 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.710
 things you end up listening to those 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.650
 guitars here sometimes gives a pain in the 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.539
 very loud ear then it breaks 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.539
 annoying the good it would be if it comes down to betray 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.970
 zola leave only the pitch of the game just the shot 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:59.550
 of weapons and that sound these things you 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.870
 could download looks like in black ops 2 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.810
 I do not remember because I did not try 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.909
 Very well, but finally, in Mw3, 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.460
 can do this 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.889
 the handset is good so recommend it until 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.720
 I recommend it was an issue with this phone x1 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:17.760
 The phone's durability is medium. 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.820
 complicated because I'm hungry just 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.099
 time and he already ruined the phone ooo cable 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.900
 of them already left and other friends who 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.300
 also have the same headphones have had the 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.740
 same problem with it stop working 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.260
 one side of the phone you have to 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.810
 tidy up the wire 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.120
 Yes, I do not recommend it 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.850
 source He is very good He is good He is not 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.980
 very expensive but he is very slut not 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.230
 it's worth having other headphones sometimes 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.240
 even at the very best price with 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.310
 a much better durability 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.590
 I hope you understood then 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.360
 the staff that my phone and my 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.730
 criticism about it I do not recommend for 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.540
 You, then, people here have a 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.300
 I finish with 1450 points 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.160
 Missing the program to come to me. 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.350
 to win the match and I just sort of 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.730
 wanting only to start using this c4 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.740
 sequence that exploded in the air I do not know 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.120
 as I think the opponent for it 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.660
 with an arrow something like that 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.060
 ended up not signing the c4 line and I left 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.700
 kind of desperately behind the 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.860
 last kill having one of them and 4 more like 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.000
 you were able to follow only die alone 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.580
 I took lead 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.260
 So I thought I'd give you an insured. 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.530
 and I'll try to kill in the shot, right? 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:30.650
 since you 4 is not working right but 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.660
 for my happiness for my happiness 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.730
 I got it and I came to this side here one 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.620
 comrade tirone and the nic.ar half one 

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.780
 trap for him plant and c4 stayed 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.740
 waiting he appeared and the pimba 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.230
 explode 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.060
 haha, this is it, good guys, I hope 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.700
 that you liked this video did not 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.290
 it's too long is not too short 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.110
 in a very interesting game if 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.640
 video and until the next 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.710
