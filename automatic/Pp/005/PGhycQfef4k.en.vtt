00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and then beauty people before you start 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060
 video of this pixel art here 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 Just let me tell you what the bag is seeing. 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.740
 a static image and is that the drawing already 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.170
 I was ready just like this video is 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 pixel art so I got the drawing that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.049
 I did when I was in school and I 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
 example 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.949
 and then I went to pixel art so let's go 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.949
 start the video 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.109
 And then beauty people, but then let's go. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.200
 Ah I made the group of the guardians of the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 galaxy and i did it pixel art sei 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 Why, but I think I have problems. 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.000
 I have not seen that in pixel art acceptance 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 it was gigantic on the canal 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440
 When I made a video, I got 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 enough preview in a short time 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.250
 Where's everyone talking my other 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.820
 tutorials I want to order pizza hut blah 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.469
 blah blah 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 good people charging our want more 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.989
 pixel art et cetera video and you're there 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.120
 a video it was well worked let's say 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.120
 so twice a good little time to do 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 but I hope you like me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 from the beginning there I started to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 applying the techniques pudding lines 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 let the line make perfect ball and this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 I'm going to teach everyone is everything in others 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 tutorial videos so I believe that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.810
 next week 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.720
 a dolphin, I do not think that week 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.450
 Come and have a video of the second video 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.079
 in this tutorial series here of pixel 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 art 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.299
 but at last we go there from the beginning of 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 drawing I thought of doing and moving 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.340
 is to make a gif but I did only not 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.409
 stayed the way I wanted because I 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.430
 do not know 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.520
 I showed, but I'll let you know from 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.040
 now that I'm channel partner 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 called the nerd word 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.490
 I talked to him, do not take the guy. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.200
 very good people 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.500
 not wanting to pull the bag but it 's a mirror 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.869
 much in him kind even in such voices 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.520
 that sometimes changes linked and there a 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 person who really inspired me to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.610
 make the videos without counting that it is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.330
 fuck so if you do not know give a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.820
 spent on his channel 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.580
 ok in the description then click O already 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.810
 I like passing on his channel is the one you 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.760
 you will not regret 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.460
 he also did the group so if you 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.150
 You want to see a little more about this? 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.770
 Be very very cool, huh? 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.990
 go there on his channel that will be on 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.390
 inscription and it looks that it is not drawing it 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.880
 made clay my wheel too to make 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.250
 some things so if you want to see 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.170
 the group he made I'll leave until 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.130
 I sing there more or less just for you. 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.400
 have notion 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.100
 click there and you will see 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 good and already gives a like there in his video such 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.720
 if you have not signed up sign up 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.650
 So I 'm tired of talking, it was very good. 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.650
 come on 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.630
 I separated type all in layers I made 500 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.300
 billions of layers like I made a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.850
 call by an arm then I made a 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.370
 another layer for a highlight of the arm 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.130
 for example after the trunk I was 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.220
 doing so separates into folders also that 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.630
 It's something I almost never do because 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.610
 I'm not lazy either, but that's helped. 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.600
 much more so if you already start with 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.700
 intention of wanting to make a gif nÃ© 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 This is very important, you can see 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.560
 which divides roughly in the chest 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.320
 Neither in the torso nor returned on Tuesday 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.360
 writer software in the arms but 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.970
 I joined the pectoral with the arms that did not 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.610
 It was a nice thing, but I 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.690
 you that in the next it will not be so 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.940
 will get better every time 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.320
 I really want to make the pixel d series 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.930
 art is something that is excited to me 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.660
 I've been learning a lot and a lot. 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.570
 thing that kind people do not know if 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 they will in a short and much more at least 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.489
 so the acceptance or that I observed 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.250
 When I put the video was a 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.379
 great for the great mass of 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.909
 Our people are confusing me for 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.220
 Speak today, my God. 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:16.070
 a lot of people like it so I go 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.500
 keep on bringing many thanks for 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.370
 support it I like is stronger 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.910
 cool 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.440
 pen that gets too pixelated is not the mistake 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.310
 pixelated both does 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.770
 come on put you can understand 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.000
 Then I started everything with black and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.120
 borders and tals 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.400
 but then I started to change the color 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.320
 from the edges of something very interesting 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.930
 also for you was fixed art 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.940
 I also can not talk too much, it's not 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.410
 because I started not even a month ago 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.050
 make factoid 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.289
 so I'm learning enough stuff 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.430
 It's still enough for 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.830
 do 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.130
 The tutorial for you guys with gringos is not 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.770
 because we gained language but finally the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.539
 Last there I started to pass a green 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.820
 a boot because he has it is because so I 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.620
 I'll tell you that I have not seen it yet. 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.599
 guardians of galaxies galaxies 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.150
 Guardians of the Galaxy 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:20.330
 but I really want to see the version on 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.880
 cinema still said that it will be released 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.050
 and boarded but I've seen ninja turtle 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.030
 It's cool, but the video is not about 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.650
 turtles 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.300
 anyway the video that is already ending and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.889
 It's over, you can see I'm going to touch it. 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.139
 very up and down and up 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.320
 down to change some of them do not know 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:48.210
 What to do for all these tests right 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.830
 animation is not a half thing it is 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.020
 complicated but is rather the 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.000
 complex you get a drawing that 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.160
 decrease and pass the pizza because so 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.740
 how drawing is as complicated as 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.980
 I do not know if you ever stopped to 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.910
 search but goes in goal and puts I think 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.070
 which is metal metal gear solid then go to 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.510
 moment to hear something that goes 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.030
 appears on the screen or if you do not 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:19.440
 written is metal gear rising and gives a 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:23.070
 look at the pixel art of my game o 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:28.110
 business type monster I'll still make one 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:31.500
 business so even want how I want 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.610
 But anyway, there is now I think I 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.130
 I started doing 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.550
 I did not put a drawing walker, I'm just going 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.830
 start making background in background i 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.800
 I took the photoshop blushes themselves 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.380
 but I'm using pencil as not 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.570
 like a brush then it's already a pixel 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.950
 so pretty cool deal 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.170
 I made a little star in the sky, that's what I'll have 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.860
 the curves is also leaving a business 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.960
 little reddish that reminds me 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.780
 those of the agnaldo ok know one 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.620
 Red deal, I do not know anymore. 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.420
 I liked 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.130
 He's not that reddish like that, but I 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.870
 I left because I have one more problem 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.850
 Anyway, this is it, people, I hope you 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.240
 enjoyed click enjoyed yet 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.370
 For God's sake, you did not stay because 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.210
 It was a tremendous job to do that. 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.260
 which took me two hours and unethical and 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.950
 a drawing, right? 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.930
 only it 's pixel but it's really fucking fine 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.820
 Gave a pass in the word nerd is very 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.760
 fuck sign up for their channel you do not 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.400
 My videos have been recorded on it and such is 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.980
 So that's it. Wait for the classes. 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.800
 pixel art by editorials or by order 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:42.800
 Too late and if we go I went
