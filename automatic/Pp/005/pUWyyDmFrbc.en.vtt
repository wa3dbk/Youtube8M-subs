 ceo author said with father medal then 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.970

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.420
 I ask you live if you're smart, you get here or there right at the beginning. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 of the match 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.330
 I like a lot 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 take the pound 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.340
 You know that door over there? 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.600
 is here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 after I died that time there 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 I tried to be safe, it points out this point of the map that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.860
 if it can be observed in the least there are points my team is all the other side 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 and I in you the sky is full 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.860
 made it easy for me to stay here I kept this piece 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.880
 even because if my team was on the other side the controversy 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.060
 the game 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.490
 the game mechanics of the game already provides this 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.580
 his ink on the other side he throws the enemy back 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.150
 distant nero usually né 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.190
 and I what I tried to stay here 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.090
 here almost I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.090
 which I hesitated and almost pld that nothing 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.849
 the sequence I was doing 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.039
 and I continued in the sequence 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.099
 ef 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.120
 if I'm not mistaken I'll bring the blackburn is not 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.269
 there now 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.420
 hehehe then there was catch the psol for 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.949
 lack 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:28.939
 and then with a blackberry just to make it easier the game, I promised myself 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.889
 I get the game easier there we unleashed in the game the part of that moment 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.369
 good but I try to bring another you also solve that dwells commenting 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.339
 it's about 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.939
 of the goal 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
 goals team in a dead man in day care 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.329
 will have a new idea 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.699
 this question to the air 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.059
 It's a question everyone is asking, right? 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 the respected of the port goals 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.609
 that was in an order in the team 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.930
 isolated rain 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.399
 then used as 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.859
 is used here not 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 no black ops because he was in the same house 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.029
 then 10 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.169
 finally paulo no 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.169
 people prefer to deal with the main subject 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.559
 but in my opinion 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.389
 the goals 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.389
 is contrary to what many people think maybe you will disagree with me 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.299
 believes the majority 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.670
 mainly to those people who travel quite the ones that go 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.439
 Up disagrees with me. 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.919
 I do not use goals I'm not the one who got a game or a shock 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.869
 keep the goals 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.179
 is very difficult 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.049
 I do not remember this way 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.929
 matches I scored 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.580
 but I think I like it 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.609
 it gives a game balance 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.609
 Imagine you only had flexible weak deck 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.249
 marathon 2009 - 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.839
 it would be one thing and another in the game 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:08.089
 the game would be a crazy run 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.519
 then the goals son 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.259
 he brings a team 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.659
 for example if you are there 1 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.430
 eight kilos is missing one for you 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 That is 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.389
 show whatever 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.680
 whatever you do you go quiet 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.759
 because you go quiet because you people know you have a goal 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.179
 I'll have someone like you so you'll calmer you. 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.680
 also worked until 20min 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.270
 Are you there for you? 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.220
 that brings a fair balance in that rush it gets so horrible to run there 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.930
 has a lot of character 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.319
 see yourself in the game 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.240
 or do you see in the game 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.719
 who kills twenty more dies 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.719
 min marten 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.460
 kills 30 more than 9 5 22 then 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.870
 the goal 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.210
 he he was oscar I believe that what was 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.520
 they put precisely nothing for this very dear 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.659
 In the game for you. 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:13.789
 log in 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.319
 gives a game cadence the traffic he dreams with more calm 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.750
 good and I know the time in my opinion if you do not agree you can leave the 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.750
 your comment because you disagree 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.490
 this is 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.590
 the reason you do not agree with the reason is if you do not like the course days 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.689
 I lived in the end 3 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.689
 the contractor boom arrives at the end there 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.550
 I wanted to be 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.440
 I asked for nothing and the fire of you if you liked to click on new ones - the renan 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.330

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:03.589
 kind of game I had I dedicated myself to litigation type of weapon

 You leave there that we're bringing you looking to bring you. 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.479

 It's what's good for the pantry they're taking in death. 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.730
