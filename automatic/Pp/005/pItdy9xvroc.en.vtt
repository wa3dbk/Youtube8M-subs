00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone guys are life and this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.799
 I'm here to do another boxing of 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 another package that I received from 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 amazon.it and with so many a purchase that I have 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.210
 made some time ago the pre order e 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 that came to me just today 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.039
 parcel is quite large and this time 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 it has nothing to do with the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.140
 technological or less not not really not 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 exactly as it was in the boxing 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.029
 of the house however we have suffered to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 opening it I armed myself with a small knife 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.439
 and we try to open in the shortest time 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.439
 possible 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 I opened the box and here is the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.750
 content 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.590
 first of all we really have a lot of paper 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 so as to be able to summarize them 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 in fact it was this that we throw away that not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.320
 we need a receipt 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 in here with some formations 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.140
 of the purchase and also this way because 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.879
 in short, we don't need it to finish 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.610
 the real object is ready 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.830
 here it is practically the brunei 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.100
 of the limited edition of amazing spider 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 man 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.880
 obviously the film that just came out 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.509
 this year of the film reboot 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.159
 this is an issue 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.640
 limited 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.800
 it seems to me a thousand pairs exactly 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.000
 the copies and mine is the number 347 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.220
 written here however then I will put some 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.880
 photo that deepened for all the the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.580
 material is an edition that contains two 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.910
 pounds you should not even be here bruno 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.550
 practically contains the blu ray plus the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.740
 Simply another contains 3d 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.310
 I would reduce and there are also contributions 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.920
 special I think in short in 2d and then there is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.530
 plus a miniature of the collection 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.600
 just spoiler that is this then 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.450
 from patti smith the profession ti 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.810
 this is very very nice 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.420
 really beautiful back with a front 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.700
 bit like so above and below that does a little 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 wall effect and nothing we go then to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.420
 boxing antonio of the film 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.380
 protective also of this convention 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.500
 then this is taken away first 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.600
 cardboard mask in this way 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.150
 therefore the packaging you see remains 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.290
 all done wall effect 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.629
 let's say with the spider symbol 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.939
 red really very very pretty on 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.299
 all sides also the above and the 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.670
 below we also have this package 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.359
 this box I managed to open 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.879
 the box not without some difficulty 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.109
 we also open on this side and see 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.079
 a little content 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:51.950
 above all we often have here in the turin 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:56.019
 obviously the blu ray blu ray 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:01.639
 now we're going to see better with 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:03.019
 in short , 3d plus the film with content 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.720
 special practically when we have 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.090
 ready two the two CDs or even here there are 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.590
 even which scenes are deleted 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.629
 in short, of their own stand-ins 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.840
 lot of estra that we're going to see in the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.180
 detail then we support it here and then 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.079
 the thing we get inside can no longer 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.079
 talk about this edition 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.150
 miniature even an empty box 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.370
 electoral here is the miniature of 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.530
 really melt man very much 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.450
 pretty before you see the details of the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.040
 miniature which is not so much then 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.450
 miniature however we have to open to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.780
 induce the I have removed the caste 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.480
 protective and this is precisely the blue ray 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.530
 in its packaging really very much 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.670
 pretty very thin also among other things 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.680
 in short we actually have the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.970
 pack to see what i am 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.460
 inside we have first of all 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.530
 a code for the playstation network 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.330
 now I don't really know the utility 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 but here is the code so you don't have it 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.930
 I show and then simply 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.680
 we have the two disks 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.980
 disc 1 here with amazing spider 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.810
 man in 3 d link is this here 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.820
 so there's the 3D movie and I think too 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 in 2d there is this possibility in short 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.680
 to see him again and then we have the disc 2 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.970
 with special content on this side 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.240
 this with the eye of a laugh this 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.040
 disc you see with the eye of spies 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.610
 now we will have the action figures instead 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.850
 which is really great 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.470
 in short, this is a piece of 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.110
 plastic and here it really is made 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.570
 done pretty well 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.940
 to be honest with this beautiful base 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.740
 in short, it looks very well 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.800
 precisely with our spy of this 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.690
 location is typically spider web and behold 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.370
 now maybe I don't know if you can 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.650
 see all the details anyway I'll put 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.259
 at the end video of the photos with 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.259
 details of this miniature that it is 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.850
 really really pretty and very much 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.009
 appreciable as you can see then 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.070
 the boxing of this limited ends here 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.419
 edition of the lady amazing spider man 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.479
 which I pre-ordered from amazon.it 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.300
 paid in total around 25 euros then 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.160
 in short, the DVD already thinks that it costs more or 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.440
 there is less this extra beauty 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.570
 packaging and especially the miniature 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.130
 which is really really pretty I start to 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.900
 finish this video of the photos 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.910
 especially the miniature to see 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.000
 in short, the details and for those who wanted 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.430
 also in the information box I insert the 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.370
 link to have to buy the short link 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.020
 direct to the listing on amazon.it a 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.260
 when, however, they are however 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.090
 limited copies this is 347 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.120
 some copies so anyway I think that 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.460
 if you take it in a short time 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440
 you could still find it this is 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.180
 the last overview of everything here from 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.780
 peter is really everything and I wait for you at 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.780
 next video
