like<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> block<00:01:07.280> what<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.460> did

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
like you're going to block what we did

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
like you're going to block what we did
to<00:01:08.909> accomplish<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to accomplish that was we use a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
to accomplish that was we use a
demi-permanent<00:01:11.070> color<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.630> no

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
demi-permanent color which has no

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.260 
demi-permanent color which has no
ammonia

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
ammonia

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.480 
ammonia
also<00:01:14.570> no<00:01:14.750> lit<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.439> since<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:15.829> were<00:01:15.890> depositing

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
also no lit so since we were depositing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.039 
also no lit so since we were depositing
color<00:01:16.729> we<00:01:16.939> did<00:01:17.090> not<00:01:17.240> need<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.539> ammonia<00:01:17.840> in

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
color we did not need the ammonia in

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.810 
color we did not need the ammonia in
there<00:01:18.259> that's<00:01:18.500> usually<00:01:18.890> drying<00:01:19.219> on<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.490> hair

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
there that's usually drying on the hair

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.569 
there that's usually drying on the hair
so<00:01:20.450> when<00:01:20.630> we<00:01:20.750> deposit<00:01:21.350> color<00:01:21.619> on<00:01:21.920> here<00:01:22.340> all

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
so when we deposit color on here all

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.969 
so when we deposit color on here all
we're<00:01:22.969> doing<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.390> adding<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:24.020> deeper<00:01:24.409> tone<00:01:24.740> to

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
we're doing is adding a deeper tone to

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.249 
we're doing is adding a deeper tone to
it<00:01:25.009> here<00:01:25.310> we're<00:01:25.640> not<00:01:25.820> lightning<00:01:26.329> me<00:01:26.509> here<00:01:26.750> so

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
it here we're not lightning me here so

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.620 
it here we're not lightning me here so

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
semi-permanent because there's no need

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.309 
semi-permanent because there's no need
to<00:01:31.759> beat<00:01:32.210> up<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:32.450> cuticle<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:33.049> here
