another<00:01:47.569> fancy<00:01:47.960> word<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.470> chromatic<00:01:49.189> key<00:01:49.819> to

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
another fancy word is chromatic key to

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.240 
another fancy word is chromatic key to
key<00:01:50.149> on<00:01:50.509> a<00:01:50.569> piano<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.649> would<00:01:51.770> have<00:01:51.860> been<00:01:51.920> an<00:01:52.069> e

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
key on a piano it would have been an e

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.669 
key on a piano it would have been an e
he<00:01:52.579> moves<00:01:52.789> right<00:01:53.060> over<00:01:53.329> 2f<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.350> now<00:01:54.500> you're

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
he moves right over 2f and now you're

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.899 
he moves right over 2f and now you're
going<00:01:54.950> with<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.909> let<00:01:56.149> me<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.420> guess<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.899> E<00:01:57.049> is

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
going with so let me just guess if E is

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.120 
going with so let me just guess if E is
nothing<00:01:58.909> held<00:01:59.209> and<00:02:00.049> then<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.380> next<00:02:00.409> half<00:02:00.860> step

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
nothing held and then the next half step

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.940 
nothing held and then the next half step
up<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.580> this<00:02:01.729> F<00:02:02.090> right<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:03.110> must<00:02:03.349> be<00:02:03.439> F<00:02:03.679> sharp

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
up is this F right that must be F sharp

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.399 
up is this F right that must be F sharp
right
