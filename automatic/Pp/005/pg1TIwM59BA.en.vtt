00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the process of knowing Foursquare and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.130 
the process of knowing Foursquare and
that's<00:00:17.370> the<00:00:17.490> process<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:18.000> taking<00:00:18.150> something

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that's the process of taking something

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.460 
that's the process of taking something
like<00:00:19.290> this<00:00:19.560> rough<00:00:19.920> lumber<00:00:21.080> turning<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.200> into

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
like this rough lumber turning it into

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.340 
like this rough lumber turning it into
this<00:00:22.770> a<00:00:23.100> piece<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> wood<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.360> use<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this a piece of wood that we can use to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.460 
this a piece of wood that we can use to
do<00:00:25.529> find<00:00:26.070> your<00:00:26.279> young<00:00:27.140> for<00:00:28.140> any<00:00:28.260> type<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
do find your young for any type of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.110 
do find your young for any type of
woodworking<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.369> important<00:00:29.850> that

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
woodworking it's really important that

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.400 
woodworking it's really important that
we<00:00:30.270> start<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.720> something<00:00:30.930> that's<00:00:31.050> flat

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
we start out with something that's flat

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.170 
we start out with something that's flat
the<00:00:32.309> correct<00:00:32.550> thickness<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.350> correctly

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.939 

usually<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.270> start<00:00:39.330> with<00:00:39.710> rough<00:00:40.710> lumber

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
usually we start with rough lumber

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.040 
usually we start with rough lumber
because<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.940> gives<00:00:42.090> us<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.449> of<00:00:42.480> flexibility

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
because it gives us a lot of flexibility

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.370 
because it gives us a lot of flexibility
you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.100> buy<00:00:44.750> lumber<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.020> already<00:00:46.200> been

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
you can buy lumber that's already been

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.300 
you can buy lumber that's already been
surface<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
surface for you

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.150 
surface for you
for<00:00:48.000> example<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.600> buy<00:00:48.829> lumber<00:00:49.829> that's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
for example you can buy lumber that's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.460 
for example you can buy lumber that's
surface<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:50.850> sides<00:00:51.060> only<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.050> left

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
surface not two sides only but it's left

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.370 
surface not two sides only but it's left
with<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> rough<00:00:53.670> width<00:00:53.970> that's<00:00:54.600> called<00:00:54.840> s2s

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
with a rough width that's called s2s

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.410 
with a rough width that's called s2s
service<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:55.980> sides<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.970> can<00:00:57.059> also<00:00:57.180> buy<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
service two sides you can also buy it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.810 
service two sides you can also buy it
like<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.469> did<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> called

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
like this which we did this is called

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.110 
like this which we did this is called
s4s<00:01:00.450> where<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.110> serviced<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.860> four<00:01:02.070> sides

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
s4s where I serviced on all four sides

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.710 
s4s where I serviced on all four sides
these<00:01:03.120> two<00:01:03.360> sides<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:05.030> tops<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> bottoms<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
these two sides and tops and bottoms and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
these two sides and tops and bottoms and
that's<00:01:06.869> called<00:01:07.229> surface<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.770> sides<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.670> then

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that's called surface or sides and then

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.969 
that's called surface or sides and then
you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.300> hit<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.690> various<00:01:10.470> lengths<00:01:10.890> you're

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you can hit it in various lengths you're

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
you can hit it in various lengths you're
gonna<00:01:11.100> pay<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:11.550> for<00:01:11.789> this<00:01:12.180> because

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gonna pay a lot more for this because

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
gonna pay a lot more for this because
somebody's<00:01:12.930> already<00:01:13.080> done<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.380> processing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
somebody's already done the processing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.330 
somebody's already done the processing
for<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.690> little<00:01:15.690> bit<00:01:15.780> less<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.229> s<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.560> s<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
for you a little bit less for s to s and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570 
for you a little bit less for s to s and
s<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> s<00:01:18.229> typically<00:01:19.229> comes<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.010> little<00:01:20.340> bit

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
s to s typically comes a little bit

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.750 
s to s typically comes a little bit
thicker<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.080> 3/4<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.290> inch<00:01:22.460> but<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> can

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
thicker than 3/4 of an inch but that can

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.550 
thicker than 3/4 of an inch but that can
present<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> problem<00:01:24.330> because<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.110> often<00:01:25.260> need

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
present a problem because we often need

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.680 
present a problem because we often need
to<00:01:25.710> bring<00:01:26.010> our<00:01:26.250> wood<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:27.030> 3/4<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
to bring our wood down to about 3/4 of

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.250 
to bring our wood down to about 3/4 of
an<00:01:27.810> inch<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.700> s<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.060> s<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.689> often<00:01:31.049> say

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
an inch and the s to s is often say

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.140 
an inch and the s to s is often say
thirteen<00:01:31.740> sixteenths<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.549> only<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.880> extra

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
thirteen sixteenths that's only an extra

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.289 
thirteen sixteenths that's only an extra
16<00:01:33.630> above<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.770> need<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> look<00:01:36.180> at

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
16 above what we need but if you look at

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.320 
16 above what we need but if you look at
this<00:01:36.420> piece<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.170> not

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
this piece you can see that it's not

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.600 
this piece you can see that it's not
it's<00:01:42.330> not<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:42.689> flat<00:01:43.189> they're<00:01:44.189> sitting<00:01:44.490> off

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it's not very flat they're sitting off

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.850 
it's not very flat they're sitting off
the<00:01:44.759> bench<00:01:45.240> oh<00:01:45.659> maybe<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> sixteenth<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> an

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the bench oh maybe a sixteenth of an

the bench oh maybe a sixteenth of an
inch<00:01:46.979> even<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.960> for<00:01:48.960> me<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> flatten<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.650> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
inch even more for me to flatten this I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
inch even more for me to flatten this I
would<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> take<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.689> fair<00:01:51.900> bit<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
would have to take off a fair bit of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
would have to take off a fair bit of
material<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.310> might<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.670> three

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
material and I might not have three

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
material and I might not have three
quarters<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> an<00:01:54.570> inch<00:01:54.659> left<00:01:55.520> after<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
quarters of an inch left after that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
quarters of an inch left after that
operational<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.799> necessarily

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
operational so it doesn't necessarily

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.000 
operational so it doesn't necessarily
save<00:01:59.549> me<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> lot<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> money<00:02:00.090> buying<00:02:00.450> something

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
save me a lot of money buying something

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.620 
save me a lot of money buying something
sorry<00:02:01.190> service<00:02:01.700> unless<00:02:01.940> I'm<00:02:02.120> willing<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.450> live

sorry service unless I'm willing to live
with<00:02:02.660> more<00:02:03.050> that's<00:02:03.290> not<00:02:03.350> very<00:02:03.620> flat<00:02:03.920> which

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
with more that's not very flat which

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.840 
with more that's not very flat which
means<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.120> can't<00:02:05.330> do<00:02:05.510> they<00:02:06.100> don't<00:02:07.100> wanna<00:02:07.400> do

so what we usually do is buy it in the
rough<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:13.430> happens<00:02:13.820> before<00:02:14.240> work<00:02:14.540> which

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
rough and this happens before work which

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.200 
rough and this happens before work which
means<00:02:15.320> it's<00:02:15.560> just<00:02:15.800> over<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.370> four<00:02:16.790> corners

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
means it's just over this four corners

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.050 
means it's just over this four corners
thick<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:18.290> over<00:02:18.590> an<00:02:18.680> inch<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:19.580> thickness

thick just over an inch in thickness

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.970 
thick just over an inch in thickness
that<00:02:20.870> gives<00:02:21.050> me<00:02:21.080> over<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.440> quarter<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.770> an<00:02:21.890> inch

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
that gives me over a quarter of an inch

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.510 
that gives me over a quarter of an inch

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
flatten this whole thing so what I would

flatten this whole thing so what I would

do is rough cut it to width

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.030 
do is rough cut it to width

that's the safest tool in this case

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.640 
that's the safest tool in this case
because<00:03:44.750> we<00:03:44.870> don't<00:03:45.019> have<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.170> straightedge<00:03:45.500> to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.809 
and I would cut it down a little closer
to<00:03:49.379> what<00:03:49.439> I<00:03:49.500> need<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:49.920> exactly<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.580> need

straighten it riddled with later cutting
it<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:59.040> rough<00:03:59.250> length<00:03:59.510> if<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.629> had<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.810> get<00:04:00.930> a

it to rough length if I had to get a

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
board about this long

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.360 
board about this long
I<00:04:03.390> wouldn't<00:04:03.780> necessarily<00:04:04.010> start<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.129> board

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
I wouldn't necessarily start with board

I wouldn't necessarily start with board
this<00:04:05.549> line<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.970> would<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.180> kind<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.390> wasteful

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
this line that would be kind of wasteful

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.899 
this line that would be kind of wasteful
so<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.129> would<00:04:08.340> cut<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.489> down<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:09.090> rough<00:04:09.810> length

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
so I would cut it down to rough length

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.190 
so I would cut it down to rough length
probably<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.090> chop<00:04:12.299> saw<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.629> red<00:04:12.989> wire

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
probably on the chop saw the red wire

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.020 
probably on the chop saw the red wire
saw<00:04:13.500> something<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.069> it's<00:04:14.819> does

then<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.930> opened<00:04:19.320> up<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.500> middle<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.859> board

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
then I opened up the middle of a board

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.349 
then I opened up the middle of a board
it's<00:04:20.310> gonna<00:04:20.459> release<00:04:20.760> moisture<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.329> that

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
it's gonna release moisture in that

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.930 
it's gonna release moisture in that
board<00:04:21.750> which<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.770> gonna<00:04:22.919> cause<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.490> want<00:04:23.880> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
board which is gonna cause it to want to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.800 
board which is gonna cause it to want to
move<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.210> little<00:04:24.240> bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
move a little bit

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.740 
move a little bit
twist<00:04:25.260> maybe<00:04:25.560> work<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.250> little<00:04:26.340> bit<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:27.510> by

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
twist maybe work a little bit so by

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.020 
twist maybe work a little bit so by
cutting<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.770> down<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.100> rough<00:04:29.250> width<00:04:29.550> that

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
cutting it down the rough width that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.909 
cutting it down the rough width that
starts<00:04:30.690> releasing<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.229> moisture<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.680> might

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
starts releasing that moisture and might

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.439 
starts releasing that moisture and might
let<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.220> sit<00:04:32.430> around<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.729> town<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.240> day<00:04:33.389> or

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
let it sit around the town for a day or

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.650 
let it sit around the town for a day or
so<00:04:33.539> like<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:35.000> move<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.270> where<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.510> wants

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
so like that to move to where it wants

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.240 
so like that to move to where it wants
to<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:37.220> after<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.280> releases<00:04:38.639> that<00:04:38.729> moisture<00:04:40.250> it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
to be after it releases that moisture it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.800 
to be after it releases that moisture it
also<00:04:41.400> makes<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.820> more<00:04:41.940> manageable<00:04:42.300> size<00:04:42.479> to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
also makes it a more manageable size to

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.270 
also makes it a more manageable size to
deal<00:04:43.020> with<00:04:43.229> this<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.680> much<00:04:43.860> easier<00:04:43.889> to

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
deal with this is much easier to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.200 
deal with this is much easier to
flattening<00:04:44.820> than<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.169> word<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.560> way<00:04:46.910> so<00:04:47.910> I

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
flattening than the word this way so I

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.820 
flattening than the word this way so I
want<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.510> get<00:04:48.660> things<00:04:48.810> as<00:04:48.990> small<00:04:49.080> as<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.470> as<00:04:49.800> I

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
want to get things as small as I as I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.469 
want to get things as small as I as I
can<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.940> most<00:04:51.120> closest<00:04:51.570> size<00:04:51.750> as<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.080> can

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
can get the most closest size as I can

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.659 
can get the most closest size as I can
one<00:04:54.479> other<00:04:54.630> thing<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.139> does<00:04:55.460> for<00:04:56.460> me<00:04:56.580> as

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
one other thing that it does for me as

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:57.850 
one other thing that it does for me as
well

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
well

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.320 
well
someone<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.039> has<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.220> natural<00:04:59.550> tension<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.240> it

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
someone that has a natural tension in it

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.210 
someone that has a natural tension in it
when<00:05:00.599> you<00:05:00.630> cut<00:05:01.110> it<00:05:01.260> it<00:05:01.500> releases<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:02.039> tension

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
when you cut it it releases the tension

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.939 
when you cut it it releases the tension
you<00:05:02.669> may<00:05:03.210> have<00:05:03.330> experienced<00:05:04.199> this<00:05:04.410> on<00:05:04.650> the

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
you may have experienced this on the

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.210 
you may have experienced this on the
table<00:05:05.250> saw<00:05:05.430> when<00:05:06.240> you're<00:05:06.449> ripping<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.740> the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
table saw when you're ripping and the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.760 
table saw when you're ripping and the
board<00:05:08.690> starts<00:05:09.690> doing<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.110> as<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.440> comes<00:05:10.470> off

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
board starts doing this as it comes off

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.700 
board starts doing this as it comes off
the<00:05:10.949> blade<00:05:11.190> or<00:05:11.699> maybe<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.030> pinches<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.449> blade

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
the blade or maybe it pinches the blade

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.930 
the blade or maybe it pinches the blade
that's<00:05:13.710> releasing<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.370> little<00:05:14.550> bit<00:05:14.639> of<00:05:14.729> tension

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
that's releasing a little bit of tension

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.670 
that's releasing a little bit of tension
in<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.270> wood<00:05:15.449> and<00:05:15.840> that's<00:05:15.990> if<00:05:16.289> that's<00:05:16.530> too

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
in the wood and that's if that's too

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.170 
in the wood and that's if that's too
severe<00:05:17.130> it's<00:05:17.280> not<00:05:17.460> necessarily

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
severe it's not necessarily

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.480 
severe it's not necessarily
years<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.590> by<00:05:20.539> ripping<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.860> down<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.310> rough

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
years so by ripping it down to rough

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.090 
years so by ripping it down to rough
width<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:23.970> might<00:05:24.150> see<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.660> what<00:05:25.530> is<00:05:25.680> doing<00:05:25.949> that

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
width I might see the what is doing that

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.290 
width I might see the what is doing that
and<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.490> might<00:05:26.669> choose<00:05:26.910> not<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.270> use<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:29.300> because

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
and I might choose not to use it because

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.909 
and I might choose not to use it because
it's<00:05:30.720> going<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.870> cause<00:05:31.050> me<00:05:31.229> problems<00:05:31.350> down<00:05:31.800> the

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
it's going to cause me problems down the

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:32.330 
it's going to cause me problems down the
road

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
road

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.719 
road
so<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.949> want<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.009> make<00:05:35.130> sure<00:05:35.160> though<00:05:35.460> that<00:05:35.490> I

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
so I want to make sure though that I

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.460 
so I want to make sure though that I
don't<00:05:35.880> try<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.240> cut<00:05:36.419> this<00:05:36.539> too<00:05:36.720> close<00:05:37.020> if<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.440> uh

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
don't try to cut this too close if I uh

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.310 
don't try to cut this too close if I uh
if<00:05:38.009> I<00:05:38.940> need<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> boarder<00:05:39.449> this<00:05:39.600> wide<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:39.990> finish

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
if I need a boarder this wide to finish

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.900 
if I need a boarder this wide to finish
I'm<00:05:40.949> gonna<00:05:41.100> cut<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.400> little<00:05:41.550> bit<00:05:41.729> wider

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
I'm gonna cut it a little bit wider

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.230 
I'm gonna cut it a little bit wider
maybe<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.360> half<00:05:42.570> inch<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.900> 3/4<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:43.530> an<00:05:43.650> inch<00:05:43.770> to

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
maybe a half inch to 3/4 of an inch to

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.219 
maybe a half inch to 3/4 of an inch to
give<00:05:45.240> me<00:05:45.300> some<00:05:45.479> room<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.810> straighten<00:05:46.169> this

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
give me some room to straighten this

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.189 
give me some room to straighten this
edge<00:05:46.440> later<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:48.120> I'm<00:05:48.389> also<00:05:48.539> going<00:05:48.780> to<00:05:48.840> cut<00:05:49.050> it

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
edge later and I'm also going to cut it

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.930 
edge later and I'm also going to cut it
a<00:05:49.380> little<00:05:49.620> longer<00:05:49.830> than<00:05:50.130> what<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.280> need<00:05:50.520> because

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
a little longer than what I need because

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.080 
a little longer than what I need because
we'll<00:05:51.270> talk<00:05:51.449> about<00:05:51.570> later<00:05:51.830> platers<00:05:52.970> when<00:05:53.970> we

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
we'll talk about later platers when we

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.450 
we'll talk about later platers when we
thickness<00:05:54.479> this<00:05:54.740> do<00:05:55.740> something<00:05:56.099> at<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.280> ends

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
thickness this do something at the ends

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.249 
thickness this do something at the ends
of<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.580> board<00:05:56.759> called<00:05:57.000> snipe<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.660> that's

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
of the board called snipe and that's

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.839 
of the board called snipe and that's
just<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.530> little<00:05:58.680> bit<00:05:58.800> of<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:59.009> dip<00:05:59.250> in<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.639> wood

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
just a little bit of a dip in the wood

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.770 
just a little bit of a dip in the wood
at<00:06:00.090> the<00:06:00.120> very<00:06:00.389> end<00:06:02.240> planers<00:06:03.240> do<00:06:03.389> that<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.750> a

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
at the very end planers do that to a

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.390 
at the very end planers do that to a
different<00:06:03.900> degree<00:06:04.169> our<00:06:04.560> planer<00:06:04.860> happens<00:06:05.250> this

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
different degree our planer happens this

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.129 
different degree our planer happens this
night<00:06:05.610> about<00:06:06.090> three<00:06:06.389> inches<00:06:06.660> from<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.960> end<00:06:07.080> of

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
night about three inches from the end of

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.779 
night about three inches from the end of
the<00:06:07.259> board<00:06:07.470> so<00:06:07.740> I'm<00:06:07.860> going<00:06:07.979> to<00:06:08.009> leave<00:06:08.160> maybe

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
the board so I'm going to leave maybe

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.360 
the board so I'm going to leave maybe
another<00:06:09.030> four<00:06:09.360> inches<00:06:09.690> on<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.960> chin<00:06:10.229> so<00:06:11.220> that

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
another four inches on the chin so that

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.550 
another four inches on the chin so that
I<00:06:11.400> can<00:06:11.580> cut<00:06:11.759> that<00:06:11.880> off<00:06:11.940> later<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.660> not<00:06:13.289> have<00:06:13.530> a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
I can cut that off later and not have a

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.930 
I can cut that off later and not have a
board<00:06:13.830> it's<00:06:14.009> got<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.190> little<00:06:14.340> bit<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> dip<00:06:14.759> on

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
board it's got a little bit of a dip on

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.830 
board it's got a little bit of a dip on
yet<00:06:15.590> so<00:06:16.590> once<00:06:16.770> I've<00:06:16.919> gotten<00:06:17.130> a<00:06:17.580> rough<00:06:18.000> cut

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
yet so once I've gotten a rough cut

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.650 
yet so once I've gotten a rough cut
board<00:06:19.110> down<00:06:19.470> to<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.770> sides<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.250> need<00:06:20.660> the

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
board down to the sides and I need the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.730 
board down to the sides and I need the
rest<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.080> steps<00:06:22.699> are<00:06:24.320> step<00:06:25.320> number<00:06:25.440> two<00:06:25.710> is

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
rest of the steps are step number two is

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.100 
rest of the steps are step number two is
flattening<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.370> face<00:06:26.610> so<00:06:27.599> the<00:06:27.659> first<00:06:27.870> thing<00:06:28.020> I

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
flattening a face so the first thing I

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.930 
flattening a face so the first thing I
had<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.289> do<00:06:28.470> because<00:06:28.979> we<00:06:29.220> can<00:06:29.370> see<00:06:29.520> this<00:06:29.639> board

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
had to do because we can see this board

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.370 
had to do because we can see this board
is<00:06:30.060> not<00:06:30.630> even<00:06:31.380> remotely<00:06:31.560> flat

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
is not even remotely flat

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.380 
is not even remotely flat
but<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:32.950> have<00:06:33.100> to<00:06:33.220> get<00:06:33.340> a<00:06:33.370> flat<00:06:33.670> surface<00:06:33.910> as<00:06:34.270> a

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
but I have to get a flat surface as a

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.820 
but I have to get a flat surface as a
reference<00:06:34.720> service<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.200> go<00:06:35.320> through<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.620> plan

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
reference service to go through the plan

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.490 
reference service to go through the plan
I<00:06:36.370> don't<00:06:37.360> have<00:06:37.480> a<00:06:37.510> flat<00:06:37.750> surface<00:06:37.960> going<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.470> a

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
I don't have a flat surface going to a

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.520 
I don't have a flat surface going to a
planer<00:06:39.330> it's<00:06:40.330> going<00:06:40.450> to<00:06:40.510> come<00:06:40.660> up<00:06:40.810> and<00:06:41.350> the

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
planer it's going to come up and the

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500 
planer it's going to come up and the
board's<00:06:41.800> worked<00:06:42.340> or<00:06:42.580> twisted<00:06:43.090> what's<00:06:43.360> going

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
board's worked or twisted what's going

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.940 
board's worked or twisted what's going
to<00:06:43.570> come<00:06:43.690> up<00:06:43.870> were<00:06:44.140> closer<00:06:44.440> than<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:44.920> other

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
to come up were closer than the other

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.110 
to come up were closer than the other
end<00:06:45.220> of<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:45.400> planer<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:48.430> once<00:06:48.610> we<00:06:48.730> have<00:06:48.820> a<00:06:48.850> flat

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
end of the planer so once we have a flat

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.690 
end of the planer so once we have a flat
reference<00:06:49.900> face<00:06:50.080> we're<00:06:50.860> gonna<00:06:50.980> go<00:06:51.490> to<00:06:51.550> the

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
reference face we're gonna go to the

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.370 
reference face we're gonna go to the
planer<00:06:51.910> and<00:06:52.030> thickness<00:06:52.480> it<00:06:52.660> down<00:06:53.080> to<00:06:53.260> the

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
planer and thickness it down to the

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.590 
planer and thickness it down to the
thickness<00:06:53.710> that<00:06:53.740> we<00:06:53.890> want<00:06:54.160> in<00:06:55.000> our<00:06:55.150> case<00:06:55.360> it's

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
thickness that we want in our case it's

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.690 
thickness that we want in our case it's
going<00:06:55.690> to<00:06:55.750> be<00:06:55.840> 3/4<00:06:56.320> of<00:06:56.380> an<00:06:56.500> inch<00:06:56.610> we're<00:06:57.610> gonna

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
going to be 3/4 of an inch we're gonna

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.130 
going to be 3/4 of an inch we're gonna
go<00:06:57.820> back<00:06:57.940> to<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.210> jointer<00:06:58.450> and<00:06:58.720> straighten<00:06:59.080> an

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
go back to the jointer and straighten an

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.480 
go back to the jointer and straighten an
edge<00:07:00.330> because<00:07:01.330> we<00:07:01.840> need<00:07:01.990> a<00:07:02.020> reference<00:07:02.380> edge<00:07:02.620> to

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
edge because we need a reference edge to

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.740 
edge because we need a reference edge to
go<00:07:03.580> to<00:07:03.640> the<00:07:03.760> next<00:07:03.910> operation<00:07:04.570> which<00:07:04.720> is

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
go to the next operation which is

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.860 
go to the next operation which is
ripping<00:07:05.170> it<00:07:05.260> to<00:07:05.290> width<00:07:05.530> on<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.860> table<00:07:06.160> saw<00:07:06.310> and

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
ripping it to width on the table saw and

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.420 
ripping it to width on the table saw and
the<00:07:07.870> very<00:07:08.050> last<00:07:08.200> thing<00:07:08.500> we<00:07:08.590> do<00:07:08.710> is<00:07:08.890> cross<00:07:09.160> cut

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
the very last thing we do is cross cut

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.080 
the very last thing we do is cross cut
the<00:07:10.740> ends<00:07:11.740> off<00:07:11.890> the<00:07:11.950> board<00:07:12.520> so<00:07:12.790> that<00:07:12.940> they're

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
the ends off the board so that they're

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.940 
the ends off the board so that they're
square<00:07:13.390> and<00:07:13.660> orders<00:07:14.260> the<00:07:14.410> appropriate<00:07:14.800> length

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
square and orders the appropriate length

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.570 
square and orders the appropriate length
that<00:07:15.130> we<00:07:15.250> want<00:07:15.480> and<00:07:16.480> you<00:07:16.570> can<00:07:16.690> remember<00:07:16.900> this

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
that we want and you can remember this

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.260 
that we want and you can remember this
by<00:07:20.040> thinking<00:07:21.040> about<00:07:21.280> we're<00:07:21.640> going<00:07:21.820> to<00:07:21.910> do<00:07:22.060> the

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
by thinking about we're going to do the

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.510 
by thinking about we're going to do the
faces<00:07:23.110> first<00:07:23.530> so<00:07:23.920> we're<00:07:24.040> gonna<00:07:24.130> flatten<00:07:24.400> the

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
faces first so we're gonna flatten the

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.300 
faces first so we're gonna flatten the
face<00:07:24.730> and<00:07:24.970> thickness<00:07:25.300> the<00:07:25.450> other<00:07:25.570> face<00:07:26.310> then

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
face and thickness the other face then

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.380 
face and thickness the other face then
we're<00:07:27.430> gonna<00:07:27.520> do<00:07:27.640> the<00:07:27.700> edges<00:07:28.030> we're<00:07:28.210> going<00:07:28.330> to

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
we're gonna do the edges we're going to

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.940 
we're gonna do the edges we're going to
straight<00:07:28.600> an<00:07:28.750> edge<00:07:28.870> and<00:07:29.080> rip<00:07:29.200> it<00:07:29.350> to<00:07:29.440> width<00:07:29.590> and

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
straight an edge and rip it to width and

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.260 
straight an edge and rip it to width and
the<00:07:30.280> last<00:07:30.460> thing<00:07:30.640> we're<00:07:30.760> going<00:07:30.850> to<00:07:30.910> do<00:07:31.060> is<00:07:31.180> the

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
the last thing we're going to do is the

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.080 
the last thing we're going to do is the
ends<00:07:31.630> so<00:07:31.960> it's<00:07:32.110> faces<00:07:32.500> edges<00:07:32.860> and<00:07:35.940> so<00:07:36.940> the

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
ends so it's faces edges and so the

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.790 
ends so it's faces edges and so the
first<00:07:37.300> step<00:07:37.510> we're<00:07:38.230> gonna<00:07:38.290> go<00:07:38.470> out<00:07:38.560> and<00:07:38.650> plant

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
first step we're gonna go out and plant

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.610 
first step we're gonna go out and plant
a<00:07:38.950> face<00:07:39.130> on<00:07:39.340> the<00:07:39.430> truck
