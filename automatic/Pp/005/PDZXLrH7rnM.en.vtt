 Good morning, people and youtube friends. 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.300
 I take care fitch sound exactly eight hours from 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:22.140
 45 minutes ago make a video here for 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:24.429
 You see the time to temper 95 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.029
 have a characteristic defect in the 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:31.050
 model a defect that gives a lot in the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:35.670
 capital also by the full lx pickup truck 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.670
 in the age group of year and 95 also 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.290
 show you what breaks the wall of 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.780
 fire 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.400
 few people know this few 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.310
 mechanics including customers 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.010
 I 've never heard of any of them and 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.660
 if it breaks the carton holder 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 direction here on the fire wall 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.800
 some models it breaks the whole plate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.960
 this plate that according to the box the direction 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 There are two here and there are two sides of it. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.760
 breaking plate all this vehicle 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.020
 especially he broke only part 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 bottom of this piece here has already been done 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:33.420
 the repair here as you can see has already been 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 welded on this screw 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.180
 you can see that only this sheet that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.390
 her name is fire stop 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.240
 the subject is good and only 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 only because he broke his legs like that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.760
 the breath from above loosened and ended 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 losing to fifa that I got there 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.430
 I got a scrap I'll have to buy 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.430
 two new screws put here 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 this is a default feature guys 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:20.040
 fiorini picape lx also breaks and I go 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.720
 talk you the will of one of the models 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.280
 there brave type the tide 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.140
 The advantage is that the steering box is 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:35.240
 supported over aggregate aggregate 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.240
 strong and safe and blue by the suspension 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.140
 there the maximum of this model that I said already 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.390
 does not have this problem 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.900
 kadett and monza have this problem 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:52.230
 it breaks - but it has time for it to hit 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.680
 right at the time that the daughter was still 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.860
 selling fiat tempra there is warranty 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.959
 for prisoners type of defect but gave 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.350
 I guarantee I'll get to 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.019
 concessionaire that broke a sign that 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.549
 had not broken in one had not 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.549
 repaired for him until the time of the team 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.200
 and to complete that direction is 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.360
 leaking 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.910
 similar to this study of the cedae in the street and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.989
 you go hell 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.510
 tabosa in the kingdom in the redeeming 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.640
 that is inside the chain are here in the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.890
 two tips have to do if you notice the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.620
 The result is that the car is disassembled 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:44.410
 also make the replacement of the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:47.700
 clutch the plateau nail is with 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.989
 approximately 1 and 6 2 minutes wear 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.670
 the clutch disc also of the final 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:08.739
 should come out one millimeter in diameter and 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:16.060
 of her canvas glue moment and also 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:17.530
 It's cheap is cheap 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.270
 we guide the client to make the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.010
 maintenance service daae why not 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.190
 will change the workforce will change only 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.850
 customer parts send the box 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.690
 direction and to give that general and 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.690
 steering gear rectifier 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.770
 and this is it people 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.250
 give a tip for you to leave do not forget the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.600
 do not make a new exit with the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.640
 vehicle stops moving the vehicle to the 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.400
 steer the wheel because you're not 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.380
 feeling nothing having weight car though 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.650
 the whole system is suffering from tip 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.370
 direction that mainly flies this 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.880
 plate that would also make it slack 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.030
 there is felt too much weight for her 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.960
 for example you turn the wheel to 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.320
 right 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.100
 this whole set here he makes the force 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.120
 same thing you turn to the 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.750
 left strengthens the entire system to that 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.710
 plate here how thin she will 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.440
 break the pallium also the family pays 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.980
 also the direction it comes upon the 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:41.010
 delegate and the lower support and 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:43.690
 suspension like that done do not have it 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.030
 has this defect and serious defect 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.780
 extremely serious 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.290
 I've seen a lot of cars since with this 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:57.520
 broken piece even once people 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.620
 drop sent there without removing the 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.470
 change the vehicle only 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.090
 Bad sucker, why? 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.500
 close the video here 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.140

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.630
