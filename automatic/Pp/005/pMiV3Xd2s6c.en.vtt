00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello boy I introduce myself right see 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.609
 again making them another video 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.860
 tutorial in this case I come to 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.960
 show how to solve the problem of 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.080
 which in the videos of bill in virtual 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.540
 dj so the first thing that you have to 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 do for those who do not have it 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.280
 obviously install the virtual 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.080
 and they execute it not only if it is that 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.260
 install for the first time 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.580
 they already execute it and they close it that way 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.110
 they installed it from scratch so what 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.450
 they had installed in front and they already have 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.820
 open they do not have to do this anymore 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.989
 so what are we going to do, let's go 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 here start 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.699
 this can be in windows 7 and windows 8 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.970
 if it is in windows 8 press the key 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:49.880
 windows and the r key 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.010
 that is going to open this little eyelash here 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.510
 you are going to write 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.510
 re g 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.610
 describe receiving and they give to accept 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 opens this tab that they will do 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.290
 you then leave 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.689
 to option number 2 that is usher 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.490
 and they go to garages where it says software 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.780
 in the software part obviously they look for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 virtual dj there is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 in the option of virtual dj they will search 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 the option 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.140
 what does it say 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 video user al memory 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.380
 I do not lie video I max user that would come 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.220
 being the maximum memory that they are going to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.619
 use 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.090
 suppose in the case that they are going to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.820
 take a notebook that has not know 8 or 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.580
 6 gigs or 4 gigs 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.259
 We will occupy the following parameters 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.550
 are going to execute then double click here 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.630
 and open this little eyelash here in the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.460
 value and go to edit the value of the work 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.649
 32 bit does not matter if they have 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.870
 installed the operating system 34 bits or 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:17.940
 be 32 or 64 decimal and here they go to 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.800
 write 800 and they give accept and then they 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 go below and look for the option that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.459
 says the video and sees 128 double click 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.470
 and in the option that says decimal the 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.600
 they select and here in the value they are going to 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.960
 place 1 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.730
 accept after that they close this just 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.730
 they go to their virtual 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.090
 run in the virtual and they will go to the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.090
 configuration option 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.540
 we're going to configuration option and 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.300
 here is the part of the codecs above 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.530
 the codex tab will look for the option 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:05.690
 that says bbg and the mpg delete the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.640
 bo eliminated and the delete and now 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.620
 they will create them 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.760
 mp g but with the one of the last option 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:22.569
 windows media video decoder clear that 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.569
 now the mp axis we see it 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.260
 and I see her seeing the same 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.579
 ok lean gallega 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 and you are ready to use your 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.480
 virtual dj with the video option 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.960
 activated and with the hardware accelerator 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.910
 that would be 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.670
 try it on the video and several others 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.500
 they had asked how this was done 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.560
 so there's the video 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.840
