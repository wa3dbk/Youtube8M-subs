this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.630> tutorial<00:00:00.900> on<00:00:01.170> how<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.410> achieve<00:00:01.589> a

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
this is a tutorial on how to achieve a

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.430 
this is a tutorial on how to achieve a
zig<00:00:02.070> zag<00:00:02.100> or<00:00:02.550> z<00:00:02.850> braid<00:00:03.120> it's<00:00:03.899> actually<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.319> lot

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
zig zag or z braid it's actually a lot

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.510 
zig zag or z braid it's actually a lot
easier<00:00:04.470> than<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.980> looks

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
easier than it looks

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.490 
easier than it looks
first<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.540> must<00:00:06.690> choose<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.080> side<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> your

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
first you must choose the side of your

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.990 
first you must choose the side of your
head<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.799> are<00:00:07.830> going<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.250> begin<00:00:08.490> with<00:00:08.700> and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
head you are going to begin with and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.720 
head you are going to begin with and
take<00:00:09.389> three<00:00:09.690> chunks<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.170> hair

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
take three chunks of hair

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.070 
take three chunks of hair
besides<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> pieces<00:00:12.330> should<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.599> based<00:00:12.870> off

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
besides the pieces should be based off

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
besides the pieces should be based off
of<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.380> own<00:00:13.620> preference<00:00:14.540> then<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:16.170> are

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
of your own preference then you are

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
of your own preference then you are
going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.619> begin<00:00:16.770> an<00:00:17.100> inverted<00:00:17.760> braid<00:00:17.970> you're

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
going to begin an inverted braid you're

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.359 
going to begin an inverted braid you're
going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> take<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> piece<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> hair<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.250> is

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
going to take the piece of hair that is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.120 
going to take the piece of hair that is
furthest<00:00:20.910> outside<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.930> bring<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.710> under<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
furthest outside and bring it under the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
furthest outside and bring it under the
middle<00:00:23.340> piece<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> hair<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.150> after<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.869> do

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
middle piece of hair and after you do

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.170 
middle piece of hair and after you do
that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.560> take<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> piece<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> hair<00:00:26.310> parallel

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
that you take the piece of hair parallel

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.790 
that you take the piece of hair parallel
to<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.720> entwined<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.680> we're

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to the one you just entwined and we're

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
to the one you just entwined and we're
gonna<00:00:28.890> under<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> new<00:00:29.429> middle<00:00:29.699> piece<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
gonna under the new middle piece so you

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.269 
gonna under the new middle piece so you
basically<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.590> keep<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.040> taking<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
basically just keep on taking the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.889 
basically just keep on taking the
outside<00:00:32.640> pieces<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.149> bring<00:00:33.270> under<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
outside pieces and bring under the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
outside pieces and bring under the
middle<00:00:34.079> piece<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.790> than<00:00:35.969> one

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
middle piece you can do more than one

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
middle piece you can do more than one
set<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.660> an<00:00:36.809> invertebrate<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.530> desired<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.070> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
set of an invertebrate if desired but I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
set of an invertebrate if desired but I
personally<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.760> braid<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:38.940> once<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
personally just braid it once and then I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.959 
personally just braid it once and then I
move<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> next<00:00:40.170> step<00:00:40.730> for<00:00:41.730> step<00:00:41.790> number

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
move on to the next step for step number

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.389 
move on to the next step for step number
two<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> achieving<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.200> exact<00:00:43.559> braid<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
two and achieving this exact braid you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
two and achieving this exact braid you
will<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> half<00:00:45.030> Dutch<00:00:45.360> braid<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
will do a half Dutch braid take the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
will do a half Dutch braid take the
piece<00:00:46.770> closest<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> sky<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> ceiling

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
piece closest to the sky or the ceiling

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
piece closest to the sky or the ceiling
and<00:00:49.320> add<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:50.100> hair<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.360> bring

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and add some hair to it and then bring

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
and add some hair to it and then bring
it<00:00:51.660> under<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> middle<00:00:52.320> piece<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:53.579> pretty

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it under the middle piece it's pretty

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
it under the middle piece it's pretty
much<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.750> invertebrate<00:00:55.350> except<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> add

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
much just an invertebrate except you add

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
much just an invertebrate except you add
hair<00:00:56.190> from<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.489> head<00:00:56.899> then<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> bottom

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
hair from your head then for the bottom

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
hair from your head then for the bottom
piece<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.489> will<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.850> simply<00:01:00.210> bring<00:01:00.480> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
piece you will just simply bring it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
piece you will just simply bring it
under<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> middle<00:01:01.770> chunk<00:01:02.039> without<00:01:02.340> adding

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
under the middle chunk without adding

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
under the middle chunk without adding
any<00:01:02.820> hair<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> regular<00:01:04.229> inverted

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
any hair just like a regular inverted
braid<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:06.750> should<00:01:06.900> repeat<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.409> steps

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
braid you should repeat these steps

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
braid you should repeat these steps
until<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.580> reach<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> other<00:01:08.970> side<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> your

head just keep on adding hair to the top

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
head just keep on adding hair to the top
and<00:01:12.240> bringing<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> under<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.350> adding

know-how to the bottom and bringing it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
know-how to the bottom and bringing it
under<00:01:15.479> once<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> reach<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
under once you reach the other side you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.710 
under once you reach the other side you
will<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> set<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.759> two<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.240> inverted

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
will do a set or two of an inverted

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
will do a set or two of an inverted
braid<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> then<00:01:19.290> continuing<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> half

Dutch<00:01:20.490> braid<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> opposite<00:01:21.420> direction

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
Dutch braid in the opposite direction

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.570 
Dutch braid in the opposite direction
every<00:01:22.590> time<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> reach<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> side<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> your

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
every time you reach the side of your

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
every time you reach the side of your
head<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.509> inverted<00:01:24.810> braid

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
head you will just do an inverted braid

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.560 
head you will just do an inverted braid
and<00:01:25.380> turn<00:01:25.619> around<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> half<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> Dutch<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:27.479> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and turn around do half a Dutch when you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
and turn around do half a Dutch when you
come<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> last<00:01:28.140> stroke<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.680> zigzag<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
come to the last stroke your zigzag you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.859 
come to the last stroke your zigzag you
should<00:01:29.820> notice<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> last<00:01:30.450> layer<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
should notice that the last layer of

too weak for your braid and trust me you
will<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.990> if<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> rest<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.680> hair<00:01:40.860> is
