point<00:04:35.510> is

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
point is

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.760 
point is
supplements<00:04:37.430> work<00:04:37.640> with<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.090> buyer

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
supplements work with the buyer

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.520 
supplements work with the buyer
drugs<00:04:39.770> worth<00:04:40.010> outside<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.910> body<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:41.570> that's

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
drugs worth outside the body and that's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.220 
drugs worth outside the body and that's
why<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.880> have<00:04:44.120> all<00:04:44.330> kinds<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.810> adverse

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
why you have all kinds of adverse

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.590 
why you have all kinds of adverse
effects<00:04:45.760> from<00:04:46.760> drugs<00:04:47.350> drugs<00:04:48.350> targeted

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.350 
effects from drugs drugs targeted
vitamins<00:04:50.600> work<00:04:50.870> synergistically<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.730> that's

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
vitamins work synergistically and that's

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.270 
vitamins work synergistically and that's
why<00:04:53.540> people<00:04:54.050> don't<00:04:54.260> understand<00:04:54.890> how<00:04:55.010> they

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
why people don't understand how they

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.030 
why people don't understand how they
work<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.640> they<00:04:55.790> do<00:04:55.970> these<00:04:56.120> tests<00:04:56.680> they<00:04:57.680> just

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
work and they do these tests they just

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.610 
work and they do these tests they just
invite<00:04:58.370> him<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.580> see<00:04:58.790> okay<00:04:59.410> they<00:05:00.410> take<00:05:00.590> a
