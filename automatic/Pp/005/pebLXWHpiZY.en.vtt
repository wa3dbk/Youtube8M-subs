plug<00:00:54.999> these<00:00:55.149> in<00:00:55.329> but<00:00:55.839> that's<00:00:56.019> really<00:00:56.379> good

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
plug these in but that's really good

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.619 
plug these in but that's really good
because<00:00:56.589> I'm<00:00:57.100> redoing<00:00:57.670> my<00:00:57.789> vanity<00:00:58.300> area

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
because I'm redoing my vanity area

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.899 
because I'm redoing my vanity area
you'll<00:00:59.140> see<00:00:59.230> in<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.710> makeup<00:01:00.070> collection<00:01:00.670> that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.340 
you'll see in a makeup collection that
I'm<00:01:00.999> going<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.179> do<00:01:01.300> when<00:01:01.480> it's<00:01:01.629> done<00:01:01.839> but<00:01:02.199> um<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I'm going to do when it's done but um I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.690 
I'm going to do when it's done but um I
thought<00:01:05.350> I<00:01:05.379> was<00:01:05.650> enough<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.070> have<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.460> plugged

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
thought I was enough to have it plugged

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.179 
thought I was enough to have it plugged
in<00:01:07.030> but<00:01:07.720> it's<00:01:07.960> actually<00:01:08.229> battery-powered<00:01:08.860> so

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
in but it's actually battery-powered so

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.889 
in but it's actually battery-powered so
we're<00:01:09.340> really<00:01:09.549> really<00:01:09.790> happy<00:01:09.909> because<00:01:10.450> then<00:01:10.840> I

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
we're really really happy because then I

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.020 
we're really really happy because then I
can<00:01:10.960> move<00:01:11.079> it<00:01:11.320> around<00:01:11.409> for<00:01:11.950> tutorials<00:01:12.549> and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
can move it around for tutorials and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.700 
can move it around for tutorials and
it's<00:01:13.540> going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> be<00:01:13.899> a<00:01:13.930> lot<00:01:14.049> easier<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.530> use<00:01:14.680> and
