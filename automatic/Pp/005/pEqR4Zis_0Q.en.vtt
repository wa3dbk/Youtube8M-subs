00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.440 

so<00:00:10.049> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.320> all<00:00:10.590> about<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.010> atmosphere<00:00:11.580> so

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
so this is all about the atmosphere so

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
so this is all about the atmosphere so
what's<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.900> atmosphere<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.860> well<00:00:14.459> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
what's the atmosphere all about well the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.420 
what's the atmosphere all about well the
atmosphere<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.660> mixture<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.349> gases<00:00:16.919> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
atmosphere is a mixture of gases that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.240 
atmosphere is a mixture of gases that
sits<00:00:17.880> around<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.540> earth<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.770> about

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
sits around the earth and it's about

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.230 
sits around the earth and it's about
about<00:00:21.000> 100<00:00:21.480> miles<00:00:21.660> high<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.880> need<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
about 100 miles high and you need to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.730 
about 100 miles high and you need to
know<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.869> made<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.349> its

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know what it's made out of its

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
know what it's made out of its
composition<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> atmosphere<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> made

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
composition so the atmosphere is made

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.590 
composition so the atmosphere is made
out<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.580> nitrogen<00:00:29.580> 78<00:00:30.510> percent<00:00:31.140> oxygen

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
out of nitrogen 78 percent oxygen

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.770 
out of nitrogen 78 percent oxygen
twenty-one<00:00:33.600> percent<00:00:33.840> are<00:00:34.830> gone<00:00:35.339> just<00:00:36.300> under

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
twenty-one percent are gone just under

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.250 
twenty-one percent are gone just under
one<00:00:36.989> percent<00:00:37.470> and<00:00:37.790> carbon<00:00:38.790> dioxide<00:00:39.260> about

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
one percent and carbon dioxide about

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.890 
one percent and carbon dioxide about
naught<00:00:40.589> point<00:00:40.830> north<00:00:41.129> four<00:00:41.460> percent<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> in

naught point north four percent and in

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.289 
naught point north four percent and in
addition<00:00:43.049> there<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.400> other<00:00:44.580> gases

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
addition there are also some other gases

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.329 
addition there are also some other gases
in<00:00:45.479> very<00:00:45.720> small<00:00:45.839> amounts<00:00:46.080> which<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.100> call

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
in very small amounts which we call

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.149 
in very small amounts which we call
trace<00:00:47.699> gases<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.540> that's<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.260> composition<00:00:50.040> of

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
trace gases and that's a composition of

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:59.260 
trace gases and that's a composition of
the<00:00:50.369> atmosphere<00:00:50.400> as<00:00:51.150> we<00:00:51.780> know<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> now

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.630 

now<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.330> amount<00:01:00.810> of<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.350> trace<00:01:01.680> gases<00:01:02.010> may

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
now the amount of these trace gases may

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060 
now the amount of these trace gases may
not<00:01:02.850> stay<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:03.360> same<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:03.870> may<00:01:04.020> vary<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.920> may

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
not stay the same they may vary they may

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
not stay the same they may vary they may
go<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.790> may<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:07.080> particular

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
go up they may go down in particular

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
go up they may go down in particular
they<00:01:07.650> may<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.190> let's<00:01:08.580> look<00:01:08.850> at<00:01:09.030> why<00:01:09.300> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
they may go up let's look at why that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
they may go up let's look at why that
may<00:01:09.780> happen<00:01:10.430> first<00:01:11.430> carbon<00:01:11.880> dioxide<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
may happen first carbon dioxide the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.680 
may happen first carbon dioxide the
levels<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.160> carbon<00:01:14.340> dioxide<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.510> up

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
levels of carbon dioxide are going up

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.540 
levels of carbon dioxide are going up
that's<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.440> we're<00:01:16.590> burning<00:01:17.010> more<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
that's because we're burning more and

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.640 
that's because we're burning more and
more<00:01:17.730> fossil<00:01:18.210> fuels<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:19.380> chopping

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
more fossil fuels and we're chopping

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
more fossil fuels and we're chopping
down<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> more<00:01:21.270> trees<00:01:21.660> that's<00:01:22.290> called

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
down more and more trees that's called

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.920 
down more and more trees that's called
deforestation<00:01:23.370> that<00:01:24.060> will<00:01:24.210> cause<00:01:24.480> carbon

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
deforestation that will cause carbon

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.530 
deforestation that will cause carbon
dioxide<00:01:25.440> levels<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> increase<00:01:26.540> carbon

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
dioxide levels to increase carbon

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.110 
dioxide levels to increase carbon
monoxide<00:01:28.260> levels<00:01:28.620> may<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.250> due<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.910> the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
monoxide levels may go up due to the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.160 
monoxide levels may go up due to the
incomplete<00:01:30.930> combustion<00:01:31.410> of<00:01:31.680> fossil<00:01:31.860> fuels

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels
sulfur<00:01:34.170> dioxide<00:01:34.740> levels<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.820> two

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
sulfur dioxide levels can go up for two

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.930 
sulfur dioxide levels can go up for two
reasons<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:37.200> volcanoes<00:01:38.160> when<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.580> erupt

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
reasons one volcanoes when they erupt

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.510 
reasons one volcanoes when they erupt
they<00:01:39.180> emit<00:01:39.479> lots<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.990> sulfur<00:01:40.350> dioxide<00:01:40.890> but

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
they emit lots of sulfur dioxide but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
they emit lots of sulfur dioxide but
also<00:01:41.729> there's<00:01:42.450> sulfur<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.080> fossil<00:01:43.470> fuels<00:01:43.800> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
also there's sulfur in fossil fuels and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.249 
also there's sulfur in fossil fuels and
if<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.250> burn<00:01:44.460> fossil<00:01:44.520> fuels<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:45.960> release

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
if we burn fossil fuels we will release

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.490 
if we burn fossil fuels we will release
sulfur<00:01:46.979> dioxide<00:01:47.720> methane<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.350> one

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sulfur dioxide methane is a good one

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.120 
sulfur dioxide methane is a good one
methane<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.250> released<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:51.330> cows<00:01:52.130> another

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
methane is released when cows another

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.609 
methane is released when cows another
cattle<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.180> burp<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.200> fart

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
cattle when they burp and when they fart

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.740 
cattle when they burp and when they fart
and<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.070> releases<00:01:56.310> lots<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.850> methane<00:01:57.300> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and that releases lots of methane so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.630 
and that releases lots of methane so
that's<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.470> as<00:01:58.650> we<00:01:58.800> have<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:59.100> cows<00:01:59.400> on

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that's going up as we have more cows on

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
that's going up as we have more cows on
the<00:01:59.700> planet<00:02:00.090> now<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.619> lastly<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:02.009> notch

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the planet now and lastly there's notch

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.060 
the planet now and lastly there's notch
and<00:02:02.640> oxide<00:02:03.150> they're<00:02:04.020> created<00:02:04.530> both<00:02:04.770> by

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and oxide they're created both by

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.580 
and oxide they're created both by
lightning<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> natural<00:02:06.570> course<00:02:07.050> but

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
lightning that's a natural course but

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.330 
lightning that's a natural course but
