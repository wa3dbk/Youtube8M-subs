00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.440
 in 1913 henri ford with the intention of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.330
 produce the strong model developed a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.060
 new production line and the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.190
 first authentic management model 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.340
 currently called mass due 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.360
 to the tendency to operate on a large scale 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.150
 also known as system 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.100
 traditional as well as the model was 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.790
 of mass production or production in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.110
 line known as traditional system 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.050
 developed at the beginning of the 20th century to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 the production of the model forte the high 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.680
 production costs man-hours 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 invested in making a car 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.320
 the philosophy of producing more and earning more 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 originated the birth of this new 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.520
 model that proposed to work on a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.580
 reduced range of products with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.759
 strongly standardized components and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.280
 processed in large batches this way 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.619
 of operating allowed the costs of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.950
 product will be reduced and will increase 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.729
 the productivity of workers 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.009
 Whereas cars 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.259
 they assembled in the traditional way one 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.210
 for one the automation was introduced 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.760
 of operations 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.670
 in this way if before the teams brought 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.010
 each of the pieces to assemble the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.720
 car from the chassis the engineers 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.760
 of forum introduced a chain of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.400
 mobile assembly at the factory plant 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.310
 the vehicle was loaded directly to 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.619
 where the worker was 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 avoiding useless travel 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.909
 controlling movements and especially 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 saving important times this 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.610
 increased production speed in 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.350
 times until quadrupled 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 reaching record manufacturing levels 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.820
 of cars leaving the line of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.970
 production one car every 10 seconds 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.370
 every day other relevant aspects 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.080
 it was the division of labor where each 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 worker is specialized in a task 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.480
 assigned without worrying about the others 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 activities how to place the wheels or 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.630
 stop cars since it was made by 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 other operators 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.060
 equally specialized in shape 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.040
 imminent this production system will 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780
 expanded from the industry of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.360
 automobile to other sectors 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.549
 industrial services and all 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.020
 of processes becoming the way 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.210
 of indisputable management 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.580
 companies managed to increase the levels 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.160
 of efficiency and productivity in almost 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.650
 all sectors of the economy what 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 led to fewer work hours 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 standardized products accessible to a 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 greater number of people and a greater 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.620
 social wealth the reduction of 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:09.440
 model prices and the increase in 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.440
 daily salary at $ 5 among others
