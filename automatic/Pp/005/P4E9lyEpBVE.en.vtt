I<00:00:20.550> never<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.390> make<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.650> portion<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.490> usually

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I never just make one portion I usually

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
I never just make one portion I usually
make<00:00:24.060> enough<00:00:24.390> room<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> two

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
make enough room so we can have it two

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:39.069 
make enough room so we can have it two
three<00:00:25.590> times<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.580> let's<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.390> started

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.290 

so<00:00:39.649> for<00:00:39.860> this<00:00:39.980> we're<00:00:40.190> going<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.370> use<00:00:40.430> one<00:00:41.059> cup

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
so for this we're going to use one cup

so for this we're going to use one cup
of<00:00:41.450> quinoa<00:00:41.690> you<00:00:42.230> could<00:00:42.770> use<00:00:42.920> one<00:00:43.190> cup<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
of quinoa you could use one cup of the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.900 
of quinoa you could use one cup of the
this<00:00:44.120> won't<00:00:44.390> cut<00:00:44.629> oats<00:00:45.200> same<00:00:45.890> thing<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.399> we're

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
this won't cut oats same thing and we're

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.910 
this won't cut oats same thing and we're
going<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.149> use<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:47.540> it's<00:00:47.750> double<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:48.500> you're

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280 
boiling so I'm two of the patients
actually<00:00:52.850> wait<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.420> boil<00:00:53.629> this<00:00:54.110> is

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
actually wait for it to boil this is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.270 
actually wait for it to boil this is
boiling<00:00:54.559> water<00:00:56.470> put<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:57.710> there

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
boiling water put that there

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.340 
boiling water put that there

you're going to add your quinoa to it
you<00:01:00.470> see<00:01:00.620> it's<00:01:00.710> already<00:01:00.829> boiling<00:01:02.290> put<00:01:03.290> Yukino

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
you see it's already boiling put Yukino

in there

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.300 
in there
you<00:01:05.119> know<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> couple<00:01:05.449> swirls<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:09.159> we're<00:01:10.159> just

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
you know a couple swirls and we're just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.540 
you know a couple swirls and we're just
going<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.490> let<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.729> sit<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.149> about<00:01:11.420> 15<00:01:11.750> minutes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
going to let it sit for about 15 minutes

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.370 
going to let it sit for about 15 minutes
on<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.880> slow<00:01:14.210> boil<00:01:14.600> right<00:01:14.960> now<00:01:15.080> it's<00:01:15.229> hot

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
on a slow boil right now it's hot

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.900 
on a slow boil right now it's hot
because<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.890> got<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.130> get<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:16.340> going<00:01:16.369> and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
because I just got to get it going and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.029 
because I just got to get it going and
then<00:01:17.869> we're<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.259> let<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.470> actually

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
then we're going to let it actually

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.430 
then we're going to let it actually
steam<00:01:19.640> for<00:01:20.119> about<00:01:20.390> five<00:01:20.690> more<00:01:20.960> minutes<00:01:21.140> we'll

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
steam for about five more minutes we'll

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.139 
steam for about five more minutes we'll
see<00:01:21.619> how<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.920> looks<00:01:22.130> like<00:01:22.340> with<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.670> texture

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
see how it looks like with the texture

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.529 
see how it looks like with the texture
okay<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.619> what<00:01:24.830> basically<00:01:25.300> we<00:01:26.300> want

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
okay so this is what basically we want

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.020 
okay so this is what basically we want
it<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.780> look<00:01:26.929> like<00:01:27.100> we<00:01:28.100> want<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.550> sort<00:01:28.850> of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
it to look like we want it to sort of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.570 
it to look like we want it to sort of
come<00:01:29.210> apart<00:01:29.330> there's<00:01:29.690> no<00:01:29.780> more<00:01:29.929> water<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.410> it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
come apart there's no more water in it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.310 
come apart there's no more water in it
it's<00:01:31.580> nice<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:31.940> hot<00:01:32.090> once<00:01:32.720> it's<00:01:32.899> like<00:01:33.110> this

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
it's nice and hot once it's like this

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.040 
it's nice and hot once it's like this
you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.890> actually<00:01:34.130> use<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:35.270> right<00:01:35.420> away<00:01:35.479> or

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
you can actually use it right away or

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.410 
you can actually use it right away or
you<00:01:36.100> can<00:01:37.100> refrigerate<00:01:37.399> it<00:01:37.670> once<00:01:37.940> it's<00:01:38.119> cooled

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
you can refrigerate it once it's cooled

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.540 
you can refrigerate it once it's cooled
