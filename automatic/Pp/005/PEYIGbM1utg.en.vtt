00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.350

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.150
 last week you were not like that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.350

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.239
 precious very beautiful projects 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.570
 the colors as we combine them if 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.000
 it can be a lot of good things and today 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.190
 towels and washcloths have Manito 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 there is bad 6 perfect with a 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.650
 different technique because the colors are 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.690
 the same as we did last time 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.910
 but in the technique it is different to 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.509
 you then choose the gang that 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.060
 they want 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.100
 according to the bath that has a process 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 it is but black and white combines with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.149
 all this last one of the girl in white 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 from the ceiling normal thanks good morning 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.659
 good lady as we always have a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.299
 scheme 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:51.170
 what is going to stay here the grid of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.170
 this fabric is 2 x 2 we are going to work it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.850
 we will mark inclusive you can 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.850
 work without marking but well I marked 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.190
 because I have different grid 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.130
 gray and black 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.140
 I have dark gray I have a white I have 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.330
 a light gray a white a gray more 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.610
 dark and a black I'm going to work in 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.320
 this case so that I keep the whites 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.320
 after the light gray 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.040
 we start as always from point 1 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.080
 we take 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.210
 and we finished like this when we throw 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.450
 we can easily pull 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.360
 and it will not open 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.019
 I made the four vertices as always 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.290
 I have them taken that I do shot and I 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.170
 the flower point must appear 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.400
 I have the four petals 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.819
 oh well tight 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.749
 I pass the thread once 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.599
 to hold two open to the other side 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:05.870
 and I do it again it has to be 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:09.830
 well attached to both sides 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.519
 and here I'm going to finish knowing what happened 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.620
 I open this thread and in the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.530
 center I will pass down 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.980
 in the little triangle that I have left here 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 what I do 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.850
 I finish because if he did not finish when I go to 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.850
 next one is going to come 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.650
 and it's going to stay all puckered I go to 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.890
 next I'm going to any of the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 vertices I do not care what I do 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.959
 a stitch and finished off 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.959
 there I hold, I go to the four 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.200
 vertices and it happens to me exactly the same 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.300
 that the above always repeats what 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.410
 same leaving a picture by means that is 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.840
 the black color here again I frown 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.480
 I repeat the same thing I have to take out all 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.220
 the petals up 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.940
 I finish on the one hand I give stitches I come 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.670
 towards the other 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.670
 I give two stitches and I go back to finish 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.620
 always to go to the other as we go to 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.280
 work on the side of the front that is 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.160
 what I have to do to get down almost in the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.500
 behind center and top itself 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.080
 and so on in the two lines 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.090
 that we have marked 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.360
 this will keep us this way 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.360
 until the end next step 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.220
 we have to form the boards for 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.070
 that we have gray and white 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.850
 and the blacks in the center which is what 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.690
 I like and I have grid will 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.690
 fold in half 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.599
 I put a pin and put another pin 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 this is what I did on all sides 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.399
 because because I have to always baste 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.739
 we have to baste so that later the 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.919
 sewing fit us well because 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:21.559
 behind we can hold with small 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.559
 stitches I'm going to turn 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.360
 and I'm going to baste this too 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.380
 here 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.570
 once I have everything subject already 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.199
 I can take out the pins and I'm going to 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.810
 proceed to assemble the design if we are going to 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.039
 take out the pin quoted and I will put together the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.039
 design that I have here 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.180
 I can start from either of the two 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.700
 sides depends on the design you have or 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.700
 depends on the drawing that I want to take 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.330
 let's go with the red thread 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.139
 I'm going to take the two targets that are 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.480
 confronted 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.460
 with a stitch 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.130
 and I go back to finish 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.100
 and finished very well because the towels 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.060
 they will always go to the washing machine 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.120
 I go to the one above and then I take the 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.420
 vertex of the one underneath there I'm going to 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.050
 close and then I start playing with the 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:34.600
 colors that I have 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.350
 and once I have this 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.350
 low 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.650
 it's something in the middle of the next 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.990
 I'm going to finish 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.750
 and I'm going to take the one above 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.970
 and the one below is beautiful in 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:58.380
 plant arrives as if they were little hearts 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.750
 yes yes and here we would have finished it if 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.370
 with the pearls and everything clear after 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.470
 we put pearls number 1 which are the 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.660
 smaller stamps as opaque what 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.030
 everyone wants but at every point that 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.760
 we have taken we put a perlite are 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.660
 beautiful and then to sew him to know him 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.510
 no longer have to use leave to 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.330
