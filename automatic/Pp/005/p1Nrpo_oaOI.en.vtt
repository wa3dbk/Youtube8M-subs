coordinates for it not a bad map not bad

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.509 
coordinates for it not a bad map not bad
at<00:00:25.210> all<00:00:25.330> got<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.320> chunk<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:26.949> sand<00:00:27.279> but<00:00:27.460> at

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
dunes on the map you can kind of tell by

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.090

though the ridges they're right off of

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.160 
though the ridges they're right off of
the<00:00:36.280> center<00:00:36.610> so<00:00:36.790> it's<00:00:36.910> pretty<00:00:37.030> cool<00:00:37.329> it's<00:00:38.050> got

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
the center so it's pretty cool it's got

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.049 
the center so it's pretty cool it's got
a<00:00:38.230> good<00:00:38.500> bounce<00:00:38.770> all<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.280> biome<00:00:39.730> there's<00:00:39.910> no

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
a good bounce all the biome there's no

a good bounce all the biome there's no
mushroom<00:00:40.510> biome<00:00:40.809> but<00:00:41.020> okay<00:00:41.770> I'll<00:00:42.010> take<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.399> you

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
mushroom biome but okay I'll take it you

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.459 
mushroom biome but okay I'll take it you
know<00:00:42.579> for<00:00:43.149> what's<00:00:43.300> on<00:00:43.450> this<00:00:43.660> map<00:00:43.840> it's<00:00:44.110> pretty

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
know for what's on this map it's pretty

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.260 
know for what's on this map it's pretty
reasonable<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.309> yeah<00:00:45.550> this<00:00:45.789> is<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.090> first

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
mark here go ahead and take these

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.340 
mark here go ahead and take these
coordinates<00:02:49.269> because<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.750> going<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.050> be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
coordinates because this is going to be

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.400 
coordinates because this is going to be
a<00:02:50.620> mineshaft<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.030> completely<00:02:52.660> buried

a mineshaft that is completely buried

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.800 
a mineshaft that is completely buried
underneath<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:55.209> village

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
underneath of this village

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.840

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
it's a pretty sizable mineshaft too so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.490 
it's a pretty sizable mineshaft too so
you're<00:02:58.030> gonna<00:02:58.120> have<00:02:58.360> uh<00:02:58.390> quite<00:02:59.319> some

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
you're gonna have uh quite some

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.960 
you're gonna have uh quite some
exploring<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.160> do<00:03:00.280> when<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.489> get<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.790> here

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
exploring to do when you get in here

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.729 
exploring to do when you get in here
which<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.209> always<00:03:01.510> good<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.810> mean<00:03:02.080> who<00:03:02.560> doesn't

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
which is always good I mean who doesn't

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.430 
which is always good I mean who doesn't
want<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.040> explore<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:04.750> else<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.140> neat<00:03:05.290> is

I<00:03:05.590> kind<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.040> went<00:03:06.190> through<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.400> mineshaft<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
I kind of went through the mineshaft a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.330 
I kind of went through the mineshaft a
little<00:03:07.150> bit<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.540> came<00:03:07.780> across<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.190> we've<00:03:09.190> got

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
little bit and I came across a we've got

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.610 
little bit and I came across a we've got
two<00:03:09.640> dungeons<00:03:09.910> here<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.959> first<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.380> gonna

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
two dungeons here the first one is gonna

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.290 
two dungeons here the first one is gonna
be<00:03:11.739> here<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:12.220> gonna<00:03:12.310> drop<00:03:12.580> all<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.030> way<00:03:13.060> down

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
be here I'm gonna drop all the way down

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.080 
be here I'm gonna drop all the way down
so<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.630> get<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> actual<00:03:15.090> y-coordinate

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so you can get the actual y-coordinate

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.190 
so you can get the actual y-coordinate
to<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.360> it's<00:03:16.540> right<00:03:16.780> down<00:03:16.959> here

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
to it it's right down here

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.920 
to it it's right down here
why<00:03:17.590> thirty-two<00:03:18.190> these<00:03:18.640> coordinates<00:03:19.180> got<00:03:19.900> a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
why thirty-two these coordinates got a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.009 
why thirty-two these coordinates got a
skeleton<00:03:20.290> spawner<00:03:20.799> here<00:03:21.220> got<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> chest<00:03:22.269> some

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
skeleton spawner here got a chest some
