John göring's tell us how it came about

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.630 
John göring's tell us how it came about
in<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.320> past<00:00:53.590> we<00:00:53.890> would<00:00:54.070> have<00:00:54.160> bought<00:00:54.309> chassis

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
in the past we would have bought chassis

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.840 
in the past we would have bought chassis
cabs<00:00:55.030> we<00:00:55.629> would<00:00:55.809> have<00:00:55.929> then<00:00:56.140> sent<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.100> out<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.280> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
cabs we would have then sent it out to a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.119 
cabs we would have then sent it out to a
body<00:00:58.300> builder<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:59.050> them<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.379> design<00:00:59.769> and

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
body builder for them to design and

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.720 
body builder for them to design and
fabricate<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.570> body<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:03.039> we<00:01:03.160> decided<00:01:03.460> on

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
fabricate the body but we decided on

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.270 
fabricate the body but we decided on
this<00:01:03.820> occasion<00:01:04.480> we<00:01:04.830> thought<00:01:05.830> we<00:01:06.010> could<00:01:06.040> do

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
this occasion we thought we could do

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.630 
this occasion we thought we could do
better<00:01:06.540> using<00:01:07.540> our<00:01:07.630> cab<00:01:07.900> Department<00:01:08.640> we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
better using our cab Department we

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.450 
better using our cab Department we
designed<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:11.110> whole<00:01:11.290> body<00:01:11.590> ourselves<00:01:12.280> we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
designed the whole body ourselves we

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.160 
designed the whole body ourselves we
knew<00:01:12.640> what<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:12.850> wanted<00:01:13.120> we've<00:01:13.690> been<00:01:13.900> in<00:01:13.990> this

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
knew what we wanted we've been in this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.200 
knew what we wanted we've been in this
industry<00:01:14.500> for<00:01:14.920> many<00:01:15.190> many<00:01:15.400> years<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.120> knew

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
industry for many many years so we knew

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.960 
industry for many many years so we knew
exactly<00:01:16.330> what<00:01:16.750> we<00:01:16.900> wanted<00:01:17.370> we<00:01:18.370> then<00:01:18.580> decided

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
exactly what we wanted we then decided

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.020 
exactly what we wanted we then decided
to<00:01:19.210> use<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.390> local<00:01:19.600> fabricator<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:21.760> CAD

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
to use a local fabricator and a CAD

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.970 
to use a local fabricator and a CAD
department<00:01:22.660> designed<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.380> whole<00:01:23.590> project

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
department designed the whole project

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.900 
department designed the whole project
all<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.030> way<00:01:25.180> through<00:01:25.480> we<00:01:26.410> thought<00:01:26.650> we<00:01:26.860> would

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
all the way through we thought we would

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.430 
all the way through we thought we would
really<00:01:27.910> practice<00:01:28.480> what<00:01:28.660> we<00:01:28.690> are<00:01:29.230> being

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
really practice what we are being

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.960 
really practice what we are being
preaching<00:01:29.980> for<00:01:30.160> many<00:01:30.340> years<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.850> our

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
preaching for many years to our

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.750 
preaching for many years to our
customers<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.750> buy<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.500> kit<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:32.860> parts<00:01:32.980> promise

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
customers to buy a kit of parts promise

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.690 
customers to buy a kit of parts promise
and<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:34.870> thought<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.170> was<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.620> this<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
and we thought it was the this was the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.540 
and we thought it was the this was the
best<00:01:36.910> example<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.690> we<00:01:37.900> could<00:01:38.170> ever<00:01:38.470> have<00:01:38.740> all

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
best example that we could ever have all

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.060 
best example that we could ever have all
the<00:01:39.850> parts<00:01:40.030> are<00:01:40.360> mark<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:41.530> either<00:01:41.710> part

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
the parts are mark there either part

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.790 
the parts are mark there either part
mark<00:01:42.370> they<00:01:42.670> actually<00:01:42.940> in<00:01:43.270> many<00:01:43.690> cases<00:01:44.170> had<00:01:44.440> the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
mark they actually in many cases had the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.650 
mark they actually in many cases had the
actual<00:01:45.160> location<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.120> where<00:01:46.360> they<00:01:46.540> were<00:01:46.630> going

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
actual location of where they were going

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.380 
actual location of where they were going
on<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.110> vehicle<00:01:47.440> body<00:01:47.670> part<00:01:48.670> marked<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.210> them

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
on the vehicle body part marked on them

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.150 
on the vehicle body part marked on them
so<00:01:49.870> when<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.110> fabricator<00:01:50.530> was<00:01:50.710> putting<00:01:51.040> it

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
so when the fabricator was putting it

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.060 
so when the fabricator was putting it
together<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.730> made<00:01:51.970> his<00:01:52.270> life<00:01:52.540> as<00:01:53.320> easy<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:54.040> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
together it made his life as easy as it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.610 
together it made his life as easy as it
possibly<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.600> be<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.290> it<00:01:56.410> worked

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
possibly can can be and it worked

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.760 
possibly can can be and it worked
extremely<00:01:57.100> well<00:01:57.400> indeed<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:59.080> saved<00:01:59.380> twenty

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
extremely well indeed we saved twenty

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.010 
extremely well indeed we saved twenty
five<00:01:59.950> percent<00:01:59.980> of<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.880> production<00:02:01.420> costs<00:02:01.720> by
