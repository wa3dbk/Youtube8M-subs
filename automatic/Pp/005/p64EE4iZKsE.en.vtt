basically how I've been farming on
diablo<00:01:25.659> 3<00:01:25.869> i<00:01:25.899> think<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.350> pretty<00:01:26.470> good<00:01:26.560> way

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
diablo 3 i think it's a pretty good way

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.670 
diablo 3 i think it's a pretty good way
it's<00:01:27.100> perfectly<00:01:27.729> safe<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.330> yeah<00:01:28.479> um<00:01:29.110> basically

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
it's perfectly safe so yeah um basically

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's perfectly safe so yeah um basically
save<00:01:30.070> all<00:01:30.280> your<00:01:30.310> stuff<00:01:30.670> once<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.210> get<00:01:31.330> full

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
save all your stuff once you get full

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.050 
save all your stuff once you get full
and<00:01:31.750> then<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.520> salvage<00:01:33.520> guy<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:33.940> then

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
and then go to the salvage guy and then

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.570 
and then go to the salvage guy and then
do<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.659> because<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:35.619> makes<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.100> lot<00:01:36.310> faster

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
do that because it makes a lot faster

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.249 
do that because it makes a lot faster
because<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.420> way<00:01:37.509> you're<00:01:37.659> not<00:01:37.690> going<00:01:37.960> every

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
because that way you're not going every

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.889 
because that way you're not going every
game<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.649> it's<00:01:39.580> all<00:01:39.700> it's<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.179> lot<00:01:40.300> more<00:01:40.330> fun<00:01:40.690> so

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
game and it's all it's a lot more fun so

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.270 
game and it's all it's a lot more fun so
it's<00:01:41.020> kind<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.200> like<00:01:41.289> opening<00:01:41.649> booster<00:01:42.009> packs

attack speed build currently I'm at 3.36

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.340 
attack speed build currently I'm at 3.36
but<00:02:23.140> it'll<00:02:23.290> go<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:24.030> 4.71<00:02:25.030> when<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.570> have<00:02:25.780> my

but it'll go to 4.71 when I have my

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.080 
but it'll go to 4.71 when I have my
other<00:02:26.470> job<00:02:26.739> which<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.040> all<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.850> other<00:02:28.000> stuff
