00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.610
 hello energy I am very short 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.840
 give a carpet 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.090
 I 've had many last days 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.800
 get news on the topic how can 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.689
 I eat enough people at all 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.700
 put your diet around to try 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.630
 to get the fruit straight and with the vegan 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.360
 nutrition and can not do it 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.020

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.320
 get 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.690
 My tip to this is breakfast in the morning 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.730
 like a king working him at noon 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.699
 in the evening like a beggar means 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.350
 catch huge huge fruit in the morning 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.809
 at noon the meat is the same 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.069
 again in the afternoon again nec 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.210
 kind of a bit of fruit or 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:45.429
 maybe also occupied red if necessary with 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.920
 with jam the water rice 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.199
 cracker with peanut butter jam 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.760
 and in the evening is cooked starch 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.239
 or again fruit and then 1000 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.889
 salad 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.989
 I want to show you what I am 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.579
 I'll have breakfast, which I'll do 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.409
 eat it for lunch and that's how it is 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.549
 around the 2000 calories I have with it 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.129
 already two thirds of my day 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.449
 needs covered and then I can 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.700
 then you do not have much to guarantee 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.020
 Stress on the back I show you that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.119
 I'll do that right now 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.930
 Always as a breakfast and lunch 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.579
 together 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.590
 in here about 500 milliliters 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.090
 filtered water 15km wheatgrass 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.320
 I have still made powder with pure 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.329
 yes I'm still a rest of that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.430
 watermelon from last night and then 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.649
 I have 20 again here now 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.560
 Bananas pure the change had 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.109
 you get two and a half liter containers 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.579
 just over two years now doubts receives 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.700
 he has it among the two, please, liter 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.109
 I do not want to buy forests for mixa 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.609
 then you get at least 15 or 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.030
 nobody even stops 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.469
 You also get 20 in and you see 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.700
 up here I hope you can see it 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.890
 follow this up and then so and so 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.929
 is on 50 grams of flaxseed with that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.469
 I forgot so again 500 g 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.259
 500 milliliters filtered water 50 km 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.109
 Flaxseed a bit of watermelon and 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.880
 120 bananas and then I would be 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.880
 35 seconds always grow through 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.160
 now I have to be careful because of that 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.989
 things to the brim be full 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:00.069
 look at such show 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:01.269
 the thing is here now until the last one 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.970
 millimeter full 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.560
 Unfortunately, that's Rieste risk when called 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.950
 Pussy you can get 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.370
 and I want that now in person 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.810
 Turn readers around and drink so I guess 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.430
 once so 1.2 liters for breakfast and then 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.549
 In a few hours I drink the rest 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 then about lunch so eat about 125 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.360
 per meal 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.580
 did you mean about 2,000 calories already 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.920
 times in Tuscany what little snails and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.180
 what few 100 calories so 5 600 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.130
 maybe do it and then I have 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 my 3000 kilocalories and me 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.260
 Personally, that's easy for me 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.000
 preferably 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.400
 and all of that helps everyone too 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 to stay heikamp because if you 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760
 2,000 kilocalories only through fruit too 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.489
 takes 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 then you can actually do a lot more 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.290
 Wrong request just as smaller 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.290
 tip is good and deep
