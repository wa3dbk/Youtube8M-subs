00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.300
 it was all that mac os 115 we get 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.640
 found for a new video all 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.230
 would have liked to 5 in 1 to enter 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.140
 any is that in his garage 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.850
 after patch 1.1 11 so I know that 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.140
 this clip is pretty well known but I want 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.769
 still do it because in the video 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.300
 former 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.220
 I received messages that bet 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.960
 elapsed know a guide to enter the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.980
 high thur in the garage so that's it 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.629
 it's done in this video 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.610
 so for that you are taking the may 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.370
 cry race had entered you it's 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.170
 the left has been placed as this is 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.969
 also you get out of your car 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.260
 he was entering the garage once 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.640
 you are in the garage you learn 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.440
 a vehicle that costs less than 50 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.690
 miles away no for me this is the mini 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.520
 so if you have between laptop she 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.100
 so is acquitted fast you go 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.450
 have random activities join 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.759
 there at the moment that really tell you 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.920
 you have taken extra and r2 at the same 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.860
 time here we are at the site you have 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 let go believe him but not the r2 so the r2 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
 you 're going to keep it just right until 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.690
 you will be in the activity and you 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.259
 so leave when there is 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.550
 the black screen 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.160
 so when you left you have 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.899
 dropped the r2 there normally salted 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.130
 so appear in the garage so you 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.259
 will have a bug so you have everything 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.390
 it is to run notice which vehicle 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.580
 up to the jetta and there normally you 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 will have a bug so you will be repaired 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.509
 with kinematics 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.400
 so we quote what does or you go 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.440
 go this custom and you're just going 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.970
 repair the vehicle 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.930
 and there you will do nothing and go out 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.909
 so custom burris also hits and in 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 outside you will go back to the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.420
 garage and move the vehicle like 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.330
 these here and there you go back in the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.530
 garage walk there as soon as you are in 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 the garage you will take anything 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.000
 which vehicle of your choice and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.799
 you 're going out of your garage has it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 so without doing anything you will come back 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.060
 in the garage so by doing a 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.920
 backwards with her two there when 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.540
 you come back the cittÃ  and well in the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.280
 garage so that's all for this 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.260
 video so do not hesitate liked the video 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.830
 and every comment the body and where 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.190
