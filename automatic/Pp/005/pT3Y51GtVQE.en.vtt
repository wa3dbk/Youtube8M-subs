not the most natural clinical finisher

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.109 
not the most natural clinical finisher
but<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> reasoning<00:01:47.670> missions<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> lot<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
but the reasoning missions a lot of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
but the reasoning missions a lot of

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
chances because he never ever hides and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.649 
chances because he never ever hides and
for<00:01:50.610> me<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.790> deserves<00:01:51.360> some<00:01:51.540> respect

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
