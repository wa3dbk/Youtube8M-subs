00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
sadly the developer Pat Burt shut their

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.420 
sadly the developer Pat Burt shut their
website<00:03:11.079> down<00:03:11.319> some<00:03:11.769> say<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.190> version

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
website down some say that this version

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.520 
website down some say that this version
of<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.760> game<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> beta<00:03:13.450> although<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> did

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
of the game is a beta although I did

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.170 
of the game is a beta although I did
some<00:03:14.709> searching<00:03:15.040> around<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.549> there's<00:03:15.970> really

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
some searching around and there's really

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.610 
some searching around and there's really
no<00:03:16.390> other<00:03:16.420> versions<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.230> game<00:03:17.260> out<00:03:17.590> there

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
no other versions of the game out there

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.550 
no other versions of the game out there
so<00:03:18.459> I'm<00:03:18.579> guessing<00:03:18.849> this<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:19.840> maybe<00:03:20.379> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
so I'm guessing this is it and maybe the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.199 
so I'm guessing this is it and maybe the
developers<00:03:21.069> decided<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.670> move<00:03:21.819> on<00:03:22.000> to

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
developers decided to move on to

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.150 
developers decided to move on to
something<00:03:22.450> else<00:03:22.720> well<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:24.040> this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
something else well that's it for this

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.339 
something else well that's it for this
