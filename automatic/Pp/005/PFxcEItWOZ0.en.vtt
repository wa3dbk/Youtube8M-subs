00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.260
[electronic holiday music]

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.160
[fizz, sip]

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.040
Aahhh!

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.100
DUKE:
"What are you waitin' for? Christmas?"

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.380
LGR:
Duke Nukem first uttered those
classic words when you went AFK

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.980
in the 1996 classic shooter, Duke Nukem 3D.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.160
Well, apparently Simply Silly Software
and WizardWorks were listening,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.460
and released Duke Nukem 3D: Nuclear Winter

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.140
in 1997.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.760
Nuclear Winter is one of the three authorized
third-party add-on packs for Duke Nukem 3D,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360
along with Duke It Out in D.C.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.980
and Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880
This one, though, is not made by Sunstorm,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880
which made Caribbean and D.C.,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.300
and you can really tell the difference in style.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.940
You'll need the Atomic Edition
of Duke 3D in order to play,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.520
since the game contains many new versions of features

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.700
introduced in version 1.4 of Duke 3D.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.700
[explosion]

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.160
In Nuclear Winter, the aliens have returned to Earth

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.460
and enslaved Santa Claus

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.800
using an alien mind-control device,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.540
and making him more evil than he already was.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.140
So goes the story told to you by the
creepy Frosty the Snowman here.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.160
What's with his mouth?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.360
It's like he had a stroke or something.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.420
In order to thwart this plot,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.640
Earth's favorite politically incorrect and
trash-talking macho man Duke Nukem

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.100
must save the world

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.060
and Christmas at the same time.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.840
You have plenty of over-the-top
weapons at your disposal

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.700
to make your way through the
various levels, blowing away aliens,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.260
collecting keycards along the way to the North Pole.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.320
All the while spouting your classic one-liners

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.660
and generally being the ultimate man's man.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.520
If that sounds familiar,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.220
well that's because it is!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.280
Gameplay remains exactly
the same for the vast majority.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680
DUKE:
"Hail to the king, baby!"

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.560
LGR:
In fact, so much of the game remains the same,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.140
it's rather disappointing.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.100
The first few levels of the game
are really just backwards versions

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.640
of the first few levels from Hollywood
Holocaust in the original game.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.460
Sure, there are new textures and
some variations to some of the rooms,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.480
but not really much.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.540
Honestly, it just seems lazy.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.380
Although I can relate to that.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.760
I guess it is kind of cool to see
how things have changed a little bit

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.260
in these developers' eyes.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.860
But still, it's just rehashing what you've
probably played a hundred times before.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.940
Many of the enemies have been redrawn
to include slightly Christmasy facades,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.560
like Santa hats, Santa outfits,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.200
and reindeer antlers,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.440
although not always to great effect.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.140
There are also new enemies that act
exactly like some of the old enemies.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.120
These include killer snowmen
that throw deadly snowballs,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.200
snowman tanks,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.000
and killer ninja elves.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.940
The elves are particularly different

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.560
due to the fact that they drop presents when they die,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.820
which you can then unwrap,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.820
and they often contain guns or ammo,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.220
so that's an interesting feature.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.080
There are also Christmas carolers in some of the levels.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.060
To me, this is really an unexpected addition.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.460
I mean, I guess you can assume

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.940
that there probably would be
Christmas carolers at this time of year,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.260
but it's just weird to me that you can kill them.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.200
[gunshot, scream]

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.320
DUKE:
"That was annoying."

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960
[gunshot, scream]

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.440
LGR:
Since Duke apparently finds them annoying.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.220
Well this really annoys me,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.460
since I think it goes against what Duke stands for.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.700
I mean, would Duke really kill innocent people?

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.100
I... don't think so.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.040
No matter how off-key they may be singing.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.720
I dunno. Somehow it just detracts
from it, even if it's just for a second.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.740
Besides, there's never any other people,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.400
other than the trapped babes in the regular game,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.780
so seeing regular humans who aren't
women or mutants is just very strange.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.240
I do, however, love the music in the game.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.240
The nice and cheery Christmas tunes

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.660
really add to the tongue-in-cheek
atmosphere of the game,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.340
and I always love hearing music
in exactly the wrong place for it.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.160
Like mass alien murder scenes in nightclubs.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.440
Just fits the overall feel of the levels.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.500
Speaking of the levels, they unfortunately
start taking a downward turn

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.140
after the Hollywood Holocaust ripoffs are through.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.680
Some of them are annoyingly maze-like

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.020
and really counterintuitive to me.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.400
It's easy to get turned around,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.540
even with the overhead map view.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.060
DUKE:
"Holy shiâ€“"

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.380
LGR:
Beyond that, many of them are just plain boring.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.460
The lighting effects, though, that they
achieved are pretty impressive in some spots,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.480
and they're similar to what was
used in Blood or Shadow Warrior.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.160
And the homage to the E1M1
from the original Doom is awesome,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160
if a little bit out of place.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.500
Not exactly what I think of when I think of Christmas.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.180
When it's all said and done,
I just wish they had gone a bit further.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.460
I mean, why not give Duke exploding snowballs

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.960
or a nuclear icepick or

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.820
a candy cane that shoots heat-
seeking missiles or something?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.540
Duke Caribbean really got this
absurdity right in this respect,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.660
and Christmas is almost the most
absurd thing you can get in a game.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.520
Beyond that, they really could
have used some new one-liners.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.320
I mean, imagine how awesome that would be.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.660
[LGR in Duke voice]
Hmm, don't have time to play with my jingle bells!

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.200
Deck the halls with bowels of pig!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.340
What are you waitin' for? Fourth of July?

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.900
You better watch out. You better not pout.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.900
Duke Nukem's coming to town!

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.800
[normal voice]
It's much to my disappointment,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.880
Nuclear Winter disappoints me,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.180
and is easily my least-favorite
add-on for the original Duke games.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.460
It could have been so much better

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.620
and really suffers from poor level design,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.120
not much new to offer,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.560
lackluster, same-old-same-old enemies,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.840
and a lack of inspiration, it seems.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.380
Essentially, they just covered everything in snow,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.000
added some Christmas music
and dropped it on the store shelf,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.780
calling it a new expansion.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.340
Still, it has become a collectible,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.740
and you can't deny how unique it is.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.000
So maybe Nuclear Winter
deserves a spot in your collection.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.760
Or perhaps it just needs to stay in Christmas past,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.000
and leave the good games to
do their job of being awesome.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.380
Duke Nukem: Nuclear Winter.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Duke Nukem: Nuclear Lame.
