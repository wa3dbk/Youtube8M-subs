00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:23.580
 here I never go tex mex il 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.410
 ubisoft parliament finally gave us 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.359
 the chance to play in first 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.250
 person an excerpt from the campaign 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.250
 single player of assassin's creed 3 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.949
 the lucky one who could wander around 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 among the streets of boston is our mattia 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:55.140
 armani who delighted us with his 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:56.939
 detailed impressions here is the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.799
 our life preview based on his 

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.049
 written piece is attached to a 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.449
 truly impressive amount of 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.449
 absolutely unpublished gameplay minutes 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.580
 the revolution starts from a house 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 colonial and immersed in the woods of the new 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.830
 england 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.149
 but first connor has to deal with 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 more immediate problems 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.690
 the landlady asks us to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.549
 fix up some bandits that infest 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.440
 the area finding the channels is one 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 matter of a few minutes but during the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.759
 clash a wolf breaks into the scene and there 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.159
 attacks in a mix of free movements and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.259
 keys to press quickly making us to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.850
 pieces that this made immediately 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.740
 clear that animals are not a mere 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.049
 tinsel introduced to show the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.659
 versatility of the emb the next engine but 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.159
 they are an integral part of the gameplay 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.439
 clues scattered on the ground allow us 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.579
 to find animals nearby and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.439
 these can be killed 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.460
 quickly to get skins from 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.869
 to sell 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.210
 also drag a group of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.219
 Enemies where a gray bear lives is one 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 effective technique to get rid of 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.409
 opponents and get a skin with few 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.409
 efforts 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.700
 then wild animals are added 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.890
 the dogs that roam the streets of the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.780
 American colonial towns and those 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.629
 trained by the soldiers who bark for 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.190
 indicate our position to the bosses 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.290
 the feeling of running freely 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.300
 jumping between obstacles remains one of the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.019
 strong points of assassin's creed 3 but 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.849
 too much freedom 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.140
 sometimes it means falling from 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.880
 several meters high 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.620
 for this the developers have 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.599
 modified one of the game mechanics 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.519
 making the race linked to the 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.560
 pressing only the back button not 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.000
 it can no longer be fatal of course it is 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.069
 possible to force connor with the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.810
 pressing the second key but in 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.489
 less understandable situations like it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.670
 they are often the branches of trees 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.810
 this is the right solution 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.340
 our test has brought us 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.590
 subsequently in the heart of the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 revolution with a mission linked to 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.190
 destruction of the deposits of you 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.989
 set in the streets of a boston 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 vintage very convincing 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.250
 that American colonial atmosphere 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.230
 of the east coast obviously you breathe 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.940
 all as one breathes more 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.890
 tension compared to previous titles 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.959
 of the series due to the incredible 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.500
 number of troop guards wandering 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.500
 for the city 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.740
 entered the city does not surprise us 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.780
 discover that the bulk of the work of 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.220
 design as in every assassin's creed is 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.280
 obviously dedicated to the agglomeration 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.020
 urban as we feared many lack the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.000
 breath of the great cities of history 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.730
 ancient but in the streets of boston there is a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.380
 another kind of atmosphere waiting for us 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.210
 wonder at the wonders built 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.430
 from the man it returns in the form of 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.020
 huge construction sites large mills on inter 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.210
 built a wooden structure 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.440
 articulated there is crowded and dense of 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.240
 homes 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.010
 all enhanced by good work 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.320
 of the graphics engine especially on 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.000
 return of materials and models 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.470
 better also enriched animations 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.450
 both in combat and in movement 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.220
 with connor that can jump too 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.410
 inside a window or elbowing 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.060
 to slide against an obstacle 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.950
 the fight always cross e 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.930
 The franchise's delight has suffered some 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.910
 improvement while remaining anchored to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.740
 old patterns as usual to the enemies 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.959
 are differentiated according to the type of 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.190
 grade equipment a captain 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.810
 with the saber and a group of 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.420
 halberdiers must be dealt with 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.190
 calm while a rifleman hired in 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.290
 body to body is an excellent opportunity to 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.750
 admire all without much effort 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.460
 new acrobatic murder sequences but 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.380
 this time the enemies especially those 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.270
 graduated have some chance of 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.580
 in fact more ubisoft reaction has 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.230
 redesigned the fighting by allowing 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.480
 even to the enemies to do double 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.130
 countermoves to disarm the player of 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.990
 throw yourself against him looking for the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.730
 best way without adopting the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.100
 classic circle formation to which 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.810
 we are used to it and this causes a bit of 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.820
 discreet chaos but as a whole i 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.440
 fights are more varied and even 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.000
 a little more difficult as it becomes 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.160
 need to find your way in a situation 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.470
 more chaotic that also asks us to 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.330
 react to any surprises in the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.100
 complex the experience seems a pinch 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.240
 more lively than in the past and in any case i 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.880
 limits of artificial intelligence 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.800
 they are undoubtedly less visible as 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.450
 icing on the connor cake has the 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.070
 possibility of equipping a grapple 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.570
 which among other things can also be used 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.010
 to hang enemies on trees and 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.040
 pennoni with a scenic result 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.930
 rather gory ultimately we know if 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.940
 written 3 looks like the richest 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.190
 chapter of the series with variations on 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.350
 theme of greater importance for stealth e 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.570
 obviously more varied fights remain 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.760
 to find out if there is space in the title 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.010
 desmond for which so far has maintained 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.170
 in the shadows sooner or later anyway 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.760
 french revolution world wars 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:06:11.980
 it will also be his turn to be the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:06:11.980
 protagonist in germany
