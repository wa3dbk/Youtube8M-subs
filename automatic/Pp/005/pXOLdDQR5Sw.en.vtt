00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.149 
problem is within the dll the d3 d9 and
all<00:02:18.209> these<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.569> false<00:02:18.810> positives<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.709> a

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
all these are false positives so a

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.770 
all these are false positives so a
majority<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.299> clean<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.239> encrypted

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
majority is clean so it's just encrypted

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.809 
majority is clean so it's just encrypted
with<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.840> media<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.980> blocks<00:02:29.189> people<00:02:29.640> from

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
with the media so it blocks people from

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.729 
with the media so it blocks people from
trying<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.120> trying<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.870> leech<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.439> call<00:02:31.620> to
