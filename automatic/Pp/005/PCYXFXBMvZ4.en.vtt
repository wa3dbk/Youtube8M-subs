00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:25.143
-Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the most

00:00:25.143 --> 00:00:27.115
spectacular show on earth.

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:32.340
-Excuse me, sir.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.590
Can we help you?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.560

JACOB (OFFSCREEN): 1931.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.830
It was the Benzini Brothers.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.140
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): That's
the most famous circus

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.520
disaster of all time.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760
Are you telling me that
you were there for--

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.010
-Right in the middle of it.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:57.700
I don't know if I picked that
circus, but something told me

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.079

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.850
AUGUST (OFFSCREEN): The
world's run on tricks.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.100
Everyone plays.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.530
-You're a beautiful woman.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.030
You deserve a beautiful life.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.330
I'm the star attraction.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.130
Out there I got nothing.
