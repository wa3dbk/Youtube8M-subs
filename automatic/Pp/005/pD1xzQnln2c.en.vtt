00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
out very very well we we have become a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.840 
out very very well we we have become a
remarkably<00:02:24.020> United<00:02:24.620> diverse<00:02:25.460> group<00:02:25.700> of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
people which is sheer grace or luck but

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.650 
people which is sheer grace or luck but
it<00:02:28.550> turned<00:02:28.730> out<00:02:28.880> beautifully<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.480> think

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it turned out beautifully and I think

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.000
