00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.810
 directed by him 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.420
 He specified that in the area 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.420
 however on your site 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.369
 early 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.989
 no I say names 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.929
 we have not got 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 the illusion 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.679
 Madrid 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.679
 in the middle of that way 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.149
 We have not had advice to be difficult 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.880
 it has already been said 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 no i do not say no speak 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 in any case the leader 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.550
 swim 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 on the other hand 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 a whole change 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.240
 keep saying 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 also his presence did not intervene 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.260
 no one 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.760
 one day after the one two weeks ago 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.420
 on March 11 1 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670
 also the NGO 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.610
 tomorrow and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.430
 in their teens 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.290
 things can not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 the find in vigo 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.730
 bernanke 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 they gave like this 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
 i 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.630
 This is one of the songs in which the content is free 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 its little facilitated 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 that is to say that one of the idad is not followed 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.350
 the totally strict but we can overtake or we can 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.530
 we go over a bit 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.580
 - final 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.840
 of each phrase 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.939
 the bundle that is used is the tgs 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.669
 the main bearing as it can be a type of variation of the wind 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.739
 by the way someone does 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.359
 you also have to take out accompaniment 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.819
 lpgc is 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.919
 area 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.089
 Sunday 15 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.369
 the media 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:25.669
 another novelty 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.129
 read 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.129
 the winner 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 a 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.249
 a little bit what I'll try is to do 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.439
 na 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.939
 with that strategy it is emphasized that doing min 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.519
 a melodic line 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.229
 in which it is opposed to little to the mayoralty of the dean of the singer 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.460
 it suits a lot 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.230
 to place the 3 of 12 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.759
 on the right hand that's the second 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.229
 2nd 3rd and 4th strings and the bass that plays in the sixth and fifth 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.179
 i only use the first string when playing a court 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.179
 for example the newly signed by 3-6 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.150
 in all demos chords the three fingers are used with him in the fourth third 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.340
 and 2nd frames the classic chords of summer of the chords are explained 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.199
 in the publication 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
