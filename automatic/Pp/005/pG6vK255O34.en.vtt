Geniuses<00:04:53.750> will<00:04:54.230> add<00:04:54.350> bonds<00:04:54.800> yeah<00:04:55.130> ahead<00:04:55.550> of

Geniuses will add bonds yeah ahead of
gamma<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:56.270> there<00:04:56.540> we<00:04:56.660> go<00:04:56.690> then<00:04:57.020> Evil<00:04:57.440> Geniuses

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
gamma so there we go then Evil Geniuses

from season two going out at once again
see<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.640> means<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.150> EG<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:08.870> think<00:05:09.290> to

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
see what it means to EG and I think to

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.620 
see what it means to EG and I think to
Snoopy<00:05:09.919> in<00:05:10.010> particular<00:05:10.370> as<00:05:10.790> well<00:05:11.000> did<00:05:11.510> he

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
Snoopy in particular as well did he

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.540 
Snoopy in particular as well did he
actually<00:05:11.750> died<00:05:12.200> in<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.440> game<00:05:12.830> he<00:05:12.860> did<00:05:13.280> die

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
actually died in that game he did die

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.060 
actually died in that game he did die
twice<00:05:13.910> which<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.480> two<00:05:14.690> times<00:05:15.020> more<00:05:15.410> than<00:05:15.919> he's

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
twice which is two times more than he's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.670 
twice which is two times more than he's
died<00:05:16.310> in<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.730> previous<00:05:17.000> two<00:05:17.570> games<00:05:17.600> as<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.620> 2

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
died in a previous two games as a 2

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.530 
died in a previous two games as a 2
times<00:05:19.130> or<00:05:19.340> there's<00:05:19.520> not<00:05:19.640> really<00:05:19.790> any<00:05:20.060> yet<00:05:20.300> I'm

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
times or there's not really any yet I'm

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.110 
times or there's not really any yet I'm
0<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.350> it's<00:05:21.650> two<00:05:21.950> times<00:05:22.280> more<00:05:22.610> than<00:05:22.669> you<00:05:22.880> did

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
0 so it's two times more than you did

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.150 
0 so it's two times more than you did
technically<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:24.050> Dan<00:05:24.200> Weiss<00:05:24.440> what<00:05:24.740> I'm<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:24.980> in

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
technically to Dan Weiss what I'm of in

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.980 
technically to Dan Weiss what I'm of in
three<00:05:25.460> games<00:05:25.640> to<00:05:26.150> death<00:05:26.330> Thursday<00:05:26.450> that's

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
three games to death Thursday that's

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.590 
three games to death Thursday that's
that's<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.160> I'm<00:05:28.340> more<00:05:28.730> impressed<00:05:29.030> at<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.330> fact

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
that's it I'm more impressed at the fact

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.300 
that's it I'm more impressed at the fact
that<00:05:29.690> Snoopy's<00:05:30.200> picked<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.650> game<00:05:30.890> to<00:05:31.160> play

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
that Snoopy's picked the game to play

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.340 
that Snoopy's picked the game to play
where<00:05:32.000> he's<00:05:32.150> confident<00:05:32.690> in<00:05:32.810> his<00:05:32.900> new<00:05:33.050> balance

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
where he's confident in his new balance

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.450 
where he's confident in his new balance
in<00:05:33.500> his<00:05:33.560> ability<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.490> affecting<00:05:35.030> matchup
