 a tractor spinner and there it is 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.840
 something to it 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.869
 because with his 50 years old steyr 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.439
 tractor he went on europe travel 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.950
 there are still over 5,000 km of track 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.630
 him 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.630
 It is the journey of his life 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.489
 starting point was his home village leutasch 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.489
 at the german border near garmisch 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.300

 to the steam engine fair 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.330
 then it should go on to spain 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.450
 via barcelona to palma de 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.450
 mallorca 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.720
 of course his heart is always with 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:07.090
 the classic car from the year 1956 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.910
 has the skilled locksmith himself 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.080
 restored and with a cabin brand 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.080
 provided own construction 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.970
 this area makes it is 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.530
 necessarily so far travel make that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.380
 triangle is a sign 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 we actually have that in austria 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.100
 unique the shipping companies the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.580
 Most trailer pressure have ears or 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.020
 several of the citizens' dogs need that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 was regulations Austria 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.729
 that's the signal dog's signal 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.130
 have been with the air but you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.950
 own air start made you look up 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.140
 the other side and that is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.319
 actually because it's the routes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.429
 in the tractor three hermanni cora so loud 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.720
 and bugle africa 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.590
 but only own own 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:06.979
 Soundproofing made that everything 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:12.019
 open otherwise not to save 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.019
 as we did then 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.990
 the oldtimer spun out of tug and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.640
 caravan dating back to the 70s ensures 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.640
 on the streets for a lot of attention 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.420
 on his way there are so many 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.570
 another factor spinner like for example 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 florian from south tyrol he our tractor 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.240
 have already made some travel 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.700
 brought 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.650
 it seems the phenomenon is asking 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.650
 what drives these people 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.250
 one has reason to stay manager 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.010

 was like a long tower and drifted so 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.120
 I would pay some attempts 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.710
 my joy so long lets itself 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.460
 The tractor spinner, however, not 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.320
 stop 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.420
 he still has a lot of kilometers to go 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.940
 We wish him good 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.480
 travel and safe in his tractor and 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.650
