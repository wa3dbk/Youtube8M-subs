hey guys is Phoenix and today I'm gonna
show<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:02.909> guys<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.600> proof<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.929> concept<00:00:04.410> for

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
show you guys my proof of concept for

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.770 
show you guys my proof of concept for
magnets<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.600> Minecraft<00:00:07.170> Let's<00:00:11.509> Get<00:00:12.509> Rid<00:00:12.570> this

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
magnets in Minecraft Let's Get Rid this

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
magnets in Minecraft Let's Get Rid this
first<00:00:13.019> alright<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.730> already<00:00:14.910> I'm

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
first alright so you can see already I'm

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.880 
first alright so you can see already I'm
holding<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> giant<00:00:15.929> magnet<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.500> actually

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
holding a giant magnet which is actually

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.640 
holding a giant magnet which is actually
an<00:00:16.949> anvil<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:19.020> works<00:00:19.439> pretty<00:00:19.560> well

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
an anvil but it works pretty well

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.429 
an anvil but it works pretty well
because<00:00:20.070> iron<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> after<00:00:21.570> all<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> Ferro<00:00:22.080> magnet

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
because iron is after all a Ferro magnet

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.009 
because iron is after all a Ferro magnet
so<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.699> acquire<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> magnetic<00:00:24.539> field<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
so it can acquire a magnetic field and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.009 
so it can acquire a magnetic field and
harness<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.480> what's<00:00:27.480> happening<00:00:27.779> here<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
harness it so what's happening here is

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.630 
harness it so what's happening here is
obviously<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.710> attracting<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.310> iron

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
obviously I'm just attracting these iron

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.810 
obviously I'm just attracting these iron
these<00:00:30.599> materials<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.320> consist<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> iron<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
these materials that consist of iron so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.430 
these materials that consist of iron so
what<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> wanna<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
what I wanna do is actually go to a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.190 
what I wanna do is actually go to a
stronghold<00:00:34.829> because<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.940> stronghold<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.750> ideal

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
stronghold because a stronghold is ideal

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
stronghold because a stronghold is ideal
for<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.000> as<00:00:39.000> soon<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> hold<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:40.910> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for this and as soon as I hold this you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.330 
for this and as soon as I hold this you
can<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.180> what's<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.480> happening<00:00:42.870> it's

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
can see what's actually happening it's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.420 
can see what's actually happening it's
basically<00:00:44.340> grabbing<00:00:44.910> any<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> surface

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
basically grabbing any of the surface

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
basically grabbing any of the surface
iron<00:00:47.430> materials<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.329> attracting<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> me

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
iron materials and attracting them to me

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.279 
iron materials and attracting them to me
so<00:00:50.100> below<00:00:50.910> me<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> whole<00:00:52.020> heap<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
so below me you can see a whole heap of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.689 
so below me you can see a whole heap of
them<00:00:52.440> they're<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> these<00:00:53.670> are

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
them they're actually a these are

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580 
them they're actually a these are
actually<00:00:54.059> iron<00:00:54.210> bars<00:00:54.449> iron<00:00:54.780> doors<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
actually iron bars iron doors and so on

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.889 
actually iron bars iron doors and so on
yep<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.730> strongholds<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.270> ideal<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
yep so strongholds are ideal for this

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
yep so strongholds are ideal for this
because<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because they actually have a lot of

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.810 
because they actually have a lot of
these<00:00:59.579> materials<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.670> what's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
these materials and you can see what's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
these materials and you can see what's
happening<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.629> grabbing<00:01:04.110> grabbing<00:01:04.830> all

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
happening I'm just grabbing grabbing all

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
happening I'm just grabbing grabbing all
of<00:01:05.189> them<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

find some more and show you as soon as I
get<00:01:09.780> rid<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> magnet<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.920> not<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
get rid of the magnet it's not going to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.789 
get rid of the magnet it's not going to
be<00:01:11.369> attracted<00:01:11.729> anymore<00:01:12.000> I've<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:12.840> made<00:01:13.590> this

be attracted anymore I've also made this
work<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.580> iron<00:01:15.090> ore<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.780> iron<00:01:16.170> blocks<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
work with iron ore and iron blocks so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
work with iron ore and iron blocks so
let's<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.119> grab<00:01:18.330> some<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> them<00:01:18.810> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
let's see if I can grab some of them I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
let's see if I can grab some of them I
am<00:01:20.930> like<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.860> let's<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.310> else

am like and I know let's see what else

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.640 
am like and I know let's see what else
die<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.820> use<00:01:27.210> them<00:01:27.450> trapdoors<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.140> off<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.439> let's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
trapdoor and it's just gonna follow me

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
trapdoor and it's just gonna follow me
like<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> magnet<00:01:59.759> does<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.210> your<00:02:00.299> life

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
like what the magnet does in your life

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
like what the magnet does in your life
so<00:02:01.079> let's<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.880> on

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
so let's get this and they have to be on

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.920 
so let's get this and they have to be on
the<00:02:03.030> surface<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.540> they're<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the surface if they're not on the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.209 
the surface if they're not on the
surface<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.829> attracted

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
surface they will not be attracted

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.240 
surface they will not be attracted
because<00:02:05.640> laws<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.810> physics<00:02:07.110> state<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> it's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
because laws of physics state that it's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
because laws of physics state that it's
pretty<00:02:08.399> obvious<00:02:08.700> anyway<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
pretty obvious anyway this is not a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
pretty obvious anyway this is not a
physics<00:02:11.220> class<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.569> pretty<00:02:12.720> common<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
physics class but it's pretty common so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.680 
physics class but it's pretty common so
much<00:02:13.349> common

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
much common

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080 
much common
so<00:02:14.470> let's<00:02:14.890> grab<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.640> as<00:02:15.850> soon<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so let's grab that and as soon as I

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.110 
so let's grab that and as soon as I
walking<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.570> them<00:02:16.690> it's<00:02:16.930> gonna<00:02:17.020> be<00:02:17.170> attractive

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
walking in them it's gonna be attractive

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.640 
walking in them it's gonna be attractive
uh-huh<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.930> there's<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
uh-huh and you can see there's a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.680 
uh-huh and you can see there's a
trapdoor<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.610> some<00:02:21.820> end<00:02:21.970> blocks<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
trapdoor there and some end blocks so I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.360 
trapdoor there and some end blocks so I
think<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.050> pretty<00:02:23.170> cool<00:02:23.290> concept

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
think it's a pretty cool concept

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.220 
think it's a pretty cool concept
the<00:02:24.640> other<00:02:24.760> two<00:02:25.030> oh<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.540> glittery<00:02:25.960> torch

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the other two oh that's a glittery torch

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.150 
the other two oh that's a glittery torch
we<00:02:26.440> fix<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.710> yeah

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
we fix that yeah

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.130 
we fix that yeah
OCD<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.290> some<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.920> villager<00:02:30.610> Gollum

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
OCD so that's some in a villager Gollum

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.740 
OCD so that's some in a villager Gollum
because<00:02:32.140> pretty<00:02:32.980> much<00:02:33.190> full<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.970> iron<00:02:34.270> these

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
because pretty much full of iron these

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.370 
because pretty much full of iron these
mobs<00:02:35.020> are<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.980> some<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.730> some<00:02:37.060> over<00:02:37.300> here<00:02:37.380> this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
mobs are so some in some over here this

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.870 
mobs are so some in some over here this
is<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.800> pretty<00:02:38.980> big<00:02:39.070> mess<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.490> let's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
is gonna be a pretty big mess so let's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.510 
is gonna be a pretty big mess so let's
get<00:02:40.090> some<00:02:40.270> minecart<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.860> guts<00:02:42.070> as<00:02:42.190> well

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
get some minecart my guts as well

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.390 
get some minecart my guts as well
whoops<00:02:43.110> because<00:02:44.110> mine<00:02:44.560> carts<00:02:44.920> are<00:02:45.010> also<00:02:45.130> full

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
whoops because mine carts are also full

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420 
whoops because mine carts are also full
of<00:02:45.460> mine<00:02:46.050> not<00:02:47.050> as<00:02:47.170> much<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.410> iron<00:02:47.710> golems<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
of mine not as much as iron golems and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.330 
of mine not as much as iron golems and
uh<00:02:49.020> it's<00:02:50.020> ash<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.440> actually<00:02:50.800> also<00:02:50.920> measures

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
uh it's ash it actually also measures

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.720 
uh it's ash it actually also measures
the<00:02:51.460> mass<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.090> these<00:02:52.840> items<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.310> dropped<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the mass so these items that I dropped a

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.980 
the mass so these items that I dropped a
really<00:02:54.940> light<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.450> pick<00:02:55.690> them<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:55.900> from

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
really light so I can pick them up from

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.820 
really light so I can pick them up from
pretty<00:02:56.260> far<00:02:56.290> away<00:02:56.500> whoops<00:02:56.910> dang<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:59.290> can

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
pretty far away whoops dang it I can

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.020 
pretty far away whoops dang it I can
pick<00:02:59.950> it<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.070> for<00:03:00.220> very<00:03:00.370> far<00:03:00.520> away<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> can

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
pick it up for very far away as you can

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.520 
pick it up for very far away as you can
see<00:03:01.180> pick<00:03:01.930> up<00:03:02.050> over<00:03:02.200> there

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
see pick up over there

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.770 
see pick up over there
whoops<00:03:02.950> sorry<00:03:03.400> sorry<00:03:03.760> oh<00:03:03.820> sorry<00:03:04.210> sorry<00:03:04.570> I

whoops sorry sorry oh sorry sorry I

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.580 
whoops sorry sorry oh sorry sorry I
didn't<00:03:04.990> mean<00:03:05.260> to

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
didn't mean to

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.790 
didn't mean to
oh<00:03:05.620> crap<00:03:06.520> it's<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.850> think<00:03:06.970> it's<00:03:07.090> right<00:03:07.800> anyway

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
oh crap it's I think it's right anyway

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.620 
oh crap it's I think it's right anyway
you<00:03:09.550> can<00:03:09.670> see<00:03:09.790> actually<00:03:09.910> picked<00:03:10.240> up<00:03:10.300> from<00:03:10.480> very

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
you can see actually picked up from very

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.730 
you can see actually picked up from very
far<00:03:10.780> away<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:13.080> need<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.260> closest<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
far away but I need to be closest to the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.200 
far away but I need to be closest to the
villager<00:03:15.100> golems<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.580> order<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.850> pick<00:03:15.970> them<00:03:16.090> up

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
villager golems in order to pick them up

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.480 
villager golems in order to pick them up
so<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.590> pick<00:03:17.710> them<00:03:17.800> up<00:03:17.860> from<00:03:18.010> over<00:03:18.130> there

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
so I can pick them up from over there

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.820 
so I can pick them up from over there
but<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> can't<00:03:19.660> pick<00:03:19.810> them<00:03:19.900> up<00:03:20.020> when<00:03:20.290> I'm<00:03:20.410> all

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
but I can't pick them up when I'm all

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.950 
but I can't pick them up when I'm all
the<00:03:20.950> way<00:03:20.980> over<00:03:21.220> here<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.450> need<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.750> get<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
the way over here see I need to get a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.680 
the way over here see I need to get a
bit<00:03:23.230> closer<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.090> bit<00:03:25.210> of<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.330> mess<00:03:25.510> actually

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
bit closer it's a bit of a mess actually

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.820 
bit closer it's a bit of a mess actually
gonna<00:03:25.960> stuff<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.320> now<00:03:26.410> very<00:03:27.190> much<00:03:27.520> whoa

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
gonna stuff that now very much whoa

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.610 
gonna stuff that now very much whoa
anyway<00:03:29.830> that's<00:03:30.250> my<00:03:30.430> concepts<00:03:30.960> yeah<00:03:31.990> magnets

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
anyway that's my concepts yeah magnets

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.860 
anyway that's my concepts yeah magnets
it<00:03:33.280> works<00:03:33.460> out<00:03:33.610> very<00:03:33.640> well<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.270> can<00:03:34.330> now<00:03:34.510> have

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
it works out very well you can now have

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.470 
it works out very well you can now have
magnets<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.470> vanilla<00:03:35.770> minecraft<00:03:36.480> but

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
magnets in vanilla minecraft but

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.260 
magnets in vanilla minecraft but
unfortunately<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.710> is<00:03:38.770> actually<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.940> bit<00:03:40.240> of

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
unfortunately this is actually a bit of

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.120 
unfortunately this is actually a bit of
a<00:03:40.360> challenge<00:03:40.660> for<00:03:40.690> me<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.930> make<00:03:41.080> uses<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.890> lot<00:03:42.040> of

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
a challenge for me to make uses a lot of

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.680 
a challenge for me to make uses a lot of
redstone<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.460> lot<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.670> command<00:03:42.850> blocks<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.300> it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
redstone a lot of command blocks and it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.390 
redstone a lot of command blocks and it
took<00:03:43.930> me<00:03:44.110> some<00:03:44.260> time<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.440> get<00:03:44.710> this<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.980> work<00:03:45.010> to

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
took me some time to get this to work to

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.130 
took me some time to get this to work to
work<00:03:45.610> okay<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.240> I've<00:03:46.450> switched<00:03:46.600> out<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.050> my

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
work okay so I've switched out of my

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.650 
work okay so I've switched out of my
resource<00:03:47.470> pack<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.760> order<00:03:48.940> for<00:03:49.060> me<00:03:49.330> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
resource pack because in order for me to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.900 
resource pack because in order for me to
search<00:03:49.930> for<00:03:50.200> any<00:03:50.350> surface<00:03:50.680> iron<00:03:51.220> materials<00:03:51.700> I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
search for any surface iron materials I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.630 
search for any surface iron materials I
needed<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.720> use<00:03:52.960> a<00:03:53.320> whole<00:03:53.710> heap<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.010> mobs<00:03:54.250> in

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
needed to use a whole heap of mobs in

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.880 
needed to use a whole heap of mobs in
order<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:54.940> search<00:03:55.180> for<00:03:55.210> them<00:03:55.510> fill<00:03:55.720> me<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.530> as

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
order to search for them fill me so as

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.320 
order to search for them fill me so as
soon<00:03:57.040> as<00:03:57.130> are<00:03:57.220> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.460> f5<00:03:57.820> mode<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.210> see

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
soon as are going to f5 mode you can see

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.580 
soon as are going to f5 mode you can see
what's<00:03:58.480> happening<00:03:58.750> there<00:03:59.320> are<00:03:59.410> a<00:03:59.440> whole<00:03:59.560> bunch

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
what's happening there are a whole bunch

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.770 
what's happening there are a whole bunch
of<00:03:59.860> slimes<00:04:00.190> they're<00:04:01.000> actually<00:04:01.450> being

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
of slimes they're actually being

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.860 
of slimes they're actually being
summoned<00:04:02.250> relative<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.460> me<00:04:03.610> one<00:04:04.420> at<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.690> one

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
summoned relative to me one at a one

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.780 
summoned relative to me one at a one
block<00:04:04.960> radius<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:06.220> this<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.460> actually<00:04:06.760> very

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
block radius so this is actually very

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.520 
block radius so this is actually very
important<00:04:07.330> because<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.870> needed<00:04:08.020> to<00:04:08.200> working

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
important because I needed to working

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.260 
important because I needed to working
out<00:04:08.620> where<00:04:08.950> these<00:04:09.190> surface<00:04:09.700> materials<00:04:10.150> are

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
out where these surface materials are

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.090 
out where these surface materials are
now<00:04:10.780> if<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.020> didn't<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.290> slimes<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.830> I<00:04:11.920> just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
now if I didn't have slimes and I just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.180 
now if I didn't have slimes and I just
used<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.460> fill<00:04:12.730> detect<00:04:13.090> fill<00:04:13.570> detector<00:04:14.190> it

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
used a fill detect fill detector it

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.000 
used a fill detect fill detector it
would<00:04:15.310> also<00:04:15.430> look<00:04:15.850> for<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.350> Lea<00:04:17.350> blocks<00:04:17.799> which

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
would also look for the Lea blocks which

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.740 
would also look for the Lea blocks which
would<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.220> inside<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:19.060> stone<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.510> I<00:04:19.570> didn't

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
would be inside the stone and I didn't

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420 
would be inside the stone and I didn't
really<00:04:19.900> want<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.109> do<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.010> used<00:04:21.280> a

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
really want to do that so I used a

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.550 
really want to do that so I used a
custom<00:04:21.729> resource<00:04:22.120> pack<00:04:22.300> because<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.990> am<00:04:23.290> I

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
custom resource pack because I am I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.200 
custom resource pack because I am I
modified<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> textures<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.760> make<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.000> slimes

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
modified the textures to make the slimes

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.970 
modified the textures to make the slimes
invisible

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
invisible

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.920 
invisible
and<00:04:26.130> that's<00:04:26.850> not<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.180> don't<00:04:27.600> consider<00:04:27.810> that

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and that's not I don't consider that

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.680 
and that's not I don't consider that
training<00:04:28.260> because<00:04:29.040> I'm<00:04:29.820> actually<00:04:30.060> summoning

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
training because I'm actually summoning

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.260 
training because I'm actually summoning
these<00:04:30.930> slimes<00:04:31.620> with<00:04:32.010> invisibility<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.910> let's

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
these slimes with invisibility and let's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.750 
these slimes with invisibility and let's
see<00:04:33.360> if<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.600> find<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.870> there<00:04:34.140> we<00:04:34.230> go<00:04:34.760> if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
see if I can find it there we go if

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.040 
see if I can find it there we go if
someone<00:04:36.120> was<00:04:36.270> invisibility<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.780> actually

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
someone was invisibility I actually

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.250 
someone was invisibility I actually
tried<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.590> add<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:38.340> invisibility<00:04:38.730> to<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
tried to add the invisibility to the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.720 
tried to add the invisibility to the
active<00:04:40.260> effects<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.860> they<00:04:41.100> didn't<00:04:41.310> work<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
active effects and they didn't work and

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.840 
active effects and they didn't work and
I<00:04:41.930> was<00:04:42.930> bit<00:04:43.080> frustrated<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:44.190> decided<00:04:44.490> why

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
I was bit frustrated so I decided why

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.450 
I was bit frustrated so I decided why
not<00:04:44.880> just<00:04:45.420> edit<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> textures<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.920> it's<00:04:47.280> not

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
not just edit the textures so it's not

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.910 
not just edit the textures so it's not
cheating<00:04:47.730> because<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.630> think<00:04:48.930> it's<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.740> bit

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
cheating because I think it's a bit

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.330 
cheating because I think it's a bit
buggy<00:04:51.020> anyway<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.320> that's<00:04:52.740> how<00:04:52.950> that's<00:04:53.070> done

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
buggy anyway so that's how that's done

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.300 
buggy anyway so that's how that's done
in<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.390> last<00:04:54.570> bit<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.380> concept<00:04:56.220> I

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
in the last bit of the the concept I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.870 
in the last bit of the the concept I
needed<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.420> work<00:04:57.570> on<00:04:57.750> was<00:04:58.880> placeholders

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
needed to to work on was placeholders

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.950 
needed to to work on was placeholders
and<00:05:00.030> I'm<00:05:00.150> using<00:05:00.300> AMA<00:05:00.510> stands<00:05:00.780> for

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
and I'm using AMA stands for

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.080 
and I'm using AMA stands for
placeholders<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.590> summoning<00:05:02.580> an<00:05:02.670> ama<00:05:02.820> stand

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
placeholders and summoning an ama stand

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
placeholders and summoning an ama stand
where<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.690> block<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.140> destroyed<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.710> that

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
where the block is destroyed and that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.850 
where the block is destroyed and that
allows<00:05:05.340> me<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.610> summon<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.120> dropped<00:05:06.390> item

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
allows me to summon the dropped item

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.740 
allows me to summon the dropped item
relative<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:08.040> understand<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.790> basically

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
relative to that understand so basically

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.630 
relative to that understand so basically
the<00:05:09.960> item<00:05:10.230> will<00:05:10.350> be<00:05:10.380> dropped<00:05:10.650> right<00:05:11.310> where

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
the item will be dropped right where

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.590 
the item will be dropped right where
it's<00:05:11.880> supposed<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.180> be<00:05:12.270> broken

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
it's supposed to be broken

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.200 
it's supposed to be broken
which<00:05:13.110> makes<00:05:13.320> sense<00:05:14.220> that's<00:05:14.670> all<00:05:14.910> added<00:05:15.090> me<00:05:15.150> to

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
which makes sense that's all added me to

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.820 
which makes sense that's all added me to
go<00:05:15.330> through<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:15.630> think<00:05:16.050> if<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.500> want<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.650> take<00:05:16.770> a

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
go through I think if you want to take a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.380 
go through I think if you want to take a
look<00:05:16.920> at<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.070> I'll<00:05:17.340> leave<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.670> download<00:05:18.060> in

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
look at this I'll leave a download in
