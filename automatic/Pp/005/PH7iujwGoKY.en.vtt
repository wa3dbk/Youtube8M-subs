00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
think it's just the first round pick

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
think it's just the first round pick
from<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> Wizards<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.990> gets<00:01:37.079> their

attention because that's gonna be like a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359 
attention because that's gonna be like a
top<00:01:38.729> 10<00:01:38.970> pick<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.470> still<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.100> them

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it sounds sketchy completely coming from

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.719 
it sounds sketchy completely coming from
me<00:02:05.270> because<00:02:05.509> my<00:02:06.409> PVR<00:02:06.740> crapped<00:02:07.130> out<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:07.490> i<00:02:07.520> will

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
me because my PVR crapped out but i will

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.890 
me because my PVR crapped out but i will
go<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.880> options<00:02:08.569> i<00:02:08.690> think<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:10.900> things

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
go to options i think it's the things

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.589 
go to options i think it's the things
association<00:02:12.590> settings<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.220> anyways<00:02:13.670> trade

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
association settings but anyways trade

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.839 
association settings but anyways trade
overrides<00:02:14.959> off<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.560> i<00:02:16.250> need<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.519> bump<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.730> up

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
overrides off and i need to bump that up

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.690 
overrides off and i need to bump that up
to<00:02:16.940> 10<00:02:17.239> just<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.019> now<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.580> turned<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
to 10 just do that right now I turned to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.600 
to 10 just do that right now I turned to
team<00:02:19.910> chemistry<00:02:20.120> off<00:02:20.450> that's<00:02:20.720> simply<00:02:21.050> because

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
team chemistry off that's simply because

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.000 
team chemistry off that's simply because
last<00:02:22.610> year<00:02:22.849> at<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.060> Raptors<00:02:23.620> when<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> did<00:02:24.890> an

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
last year at the Raptors when I did an

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.080 
last year at the Raptors when I did an
association<00:02:26.290> they<00:02:27.430> basically<00:02:28.430> screwed<00:02:28.910> me

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
association they basically screwed me

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.300 
association they basically screwed me
because<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.080> first<00:02:30.319> couple<00:02:30.500> years<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:31.130> they

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
because the first couple years like they

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.850 
because the first couple years like they
all<00:02:31.430> didn't<00:02:31.730> get<00:02:31.849> together<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.590> don't<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.680> why

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
all didn't get together I don't know why

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 
all didn't get together I don't know why
I<00:02:33.890> guess<00:02:34.220> they<00:02:34.370> couldn't<00:02:34.549> mesh<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.239> that's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
I guess they couldn't mesh and that's

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.789 
I guess they couldn't mesh and that's
what<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.930> got<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.260> i<00:02:36.290> don't<00:02:36.470> know<00:02:36.530> if<00:02:36.620> it's

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
what you got so i don't know if it's

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.460 
what you got so i don't know if it's
glitch<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.280> same<00:02:37.519> this<00:02:37.790> year<00:02:37.849> but<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.569> got<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
glitch the same this year but I got that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.860 
glitch the same this year but I got that
going<00:02:39.769> what<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.030> anyways<00:02:41.569> I'm<00:02:41.750> just

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
going what it is but anyways I'm just

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.839 
going what it is but anyways I'm just
gonna<00:02:41.959> go<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.170> simulate<00:02:42.530> five<00:02:42.830> games<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.610> and

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
gonna go and simulate five games in and

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.160 
gonna go and simulate five games in and
see<00:02:44.000> how<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.239> goes<00:02:44.420> i<00:02:44.599> was<00:02:44.720> thinking<00:02:45.049> about

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
see how it goes i was thinking about

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.940 
see how it goes i was thinking about
during<00:02:45.530> stimulating<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:47.209> whole<00:02:47.390> season<00:02:47.989> just

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
during stimulating the whole season just

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.650 
during stimulating the whole season just
this<00:02:49.099> season<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.700> see<00:02:49.880> what<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.239> get<00:02:50.420> but

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
this season to see what we can get but

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.530 
this season to see what we can get but
now<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.019> drew<00:02:51.200> holiday<00:02:52.030> i'm<00:02:53.030> not<00:02:53.180> really<00:02:53.390> sure

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
and i need to check the rotation

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.190 
and i need to check the rotation
beforehand<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:55.819> i<00:02:56.360> don't<00:02:56.989> know<00:02:57.049> if<00:02:57.140> i

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
beforehand because i don't know if i

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.430 
beforehand because i don't know if i
changed<00:02:57.620> or<00:02:57.769> not<00:02:57.920> already<00:02:58.280> i<00:02:59.140> think<00:03:00.140> i<00:03:00.200> did

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
actually just check it for a second we

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.759 
actually just check it for a second we
do<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:03.980> german<00:03:04.459> up<00:03:05.030> Wow<00:03:05.630> Jameer<00:03:06.230> Nelson<00:03:06.290> has

a<00:03:06.799> backup<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:09.019> let's<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.470> go<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.829> real

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
a backup so let's just go to that real

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.590 
a backup so let's just go to that real
quick<00:03:11.890> yes<00:03:12.890> we<00:03:13.160> did<00:03:13.310> change<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.209> remember

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600

quick yes we did change it I remember
this<00:03:14.950> all<00:03:15.950> seems<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.400> be<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.579> order<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:17.060> had<00:03:17.180> to

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
this all seems to be in order we had to

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.569 
this all seems to be in order we had to
put<00:03:17.389> Gustavo<00:03:18.170> Ayon<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:18.950> bench<00:03:19.160> just

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
put Gustavo Ayon on the bench just

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.180 
put Gustavo Ayon on the bench just
because<00:03:20.389> I<00:03:20.480> feel<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:21.410> these<00:03:21.769> other<00:03:21.829> ones

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
because I feel like all these other ones

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.849 
because I feel like all these other ones
are<00:03:22.600> young<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.840> they<00:03:23.959> can<00:03:24.109> give<00:03:24.590> me<00:03:24.709> good

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
are young and they can give me good

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.629

minutes ions ball a little bit less than
decent<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:30.200> don't<00:03:30.350> think<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> fit

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
decent but I just don't think you fit

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.550 
decent but I just don't think you fit
with<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.280> system<00:03:31.519> very<00:03:31.910> well<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:33.139> I'm<00:03:33.410> just

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
with this system very well so I'm just

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.870 
with this system very well so I'm just
gonna<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:33.950> single<00:03:34.220> ate<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.730> new

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
gonna go and single ate it to the new

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.920 
gonna go and single ate it to the new
york<00:03:34.940> knicks<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:35.660> see<00:03:36.079> what<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.290> can<00:03:36.380> get<00:03:36.590> I

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
york knicks and see what we can get I

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.240 
york knicks and see what we can get I
mean<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.019> do<00:03:39.139> have<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.319> new<00:03:39.440> addition<00:03:39.560> so

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
mean we do have a new addition so

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.120 
mean we do have a new addition so
hopefully<00:03:40.850> everything<00:03:41.540> will<00:03:41.750> align<00:03:42.130> properly

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
hopefully everything will align properly

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.069 
hopefully everything will align properly
but<00:03:43.639> I'd<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.329> simulate<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.870> free

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
but I'd really like to simulate to free

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.199 
but I'd really like to simulate to free
agency<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.859> next<00:03:46.190> season<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.850> see<00:03:47.030> what<00:03:47.150> we

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
agency of next season and see what we

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.629 
agency of next season and see what we
can<00:03:47.299> get<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.920> depending<00:03:48.920> on<00:03:49.010> these<00:03:49.310> first

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
can get so depending on these first

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.550 
can get so depending on these first
couple<00:03:49.819> games<00:03:49.970> we'll<00:03:50.389> see<00:03:51.910> we<00:03:52.910> win<00:03:53.560> we

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
couple games we'll see we win we

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.819 
couple games we'll see we win we
actually<00:03:54.829> beat<00:03:55.010> Brooklyn<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:57.500> is<00:03:57.680> what

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
actually beat Brooklyn and this is what

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.820 
actually beat Brooklyn and this is what
I'm<00:03:57.920> talking<00:03:57.950> about

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.530 

injuries<00:04:01.830> may<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.610> problem<00:04:03.000> this<00:04:03.300> season

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
injuries may be a problem this season

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.590 
injuries may be a problem this season
we'll<00:04:04.080> see<00:04:04.350> but<00:04:05.150> Brandon<00:04:06.150> Bass<00:04:06.300> has

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
we'll see but Brandon Bass has

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.810 
we'll see but Brandon Bass has
apparently<00:04:06.930> sprained<00:04:07.500> his<00:04:07.710> knee<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.610> it's<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
apparently sprained his knee so it's a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.730 
apparently sprained his knee so it's a
two<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.000> four<00:04:09.270> weeks<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.960> will<00:04:10.140> be<00:04:10.260> unable<00:04:10.410> to

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
two to four weeks and will be unable to

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.740 
two to four weeks and will be unable to
play<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:13.550> was<00:04:14.550> gonna<00:04:14.670> adjust<00:04:15.060> rotation

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
play so I was gonna adjust rotation

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.120 
play so I was gonna adjust rotation
manually<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.470> guess<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:19.109> can<00:04:19.260> dump<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> minutes

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
manually I guess we can dump the minutes

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.690 
manually I guess we can dump the minutes
for<00:04:21.350> Nicholson<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.470> play<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:24.800> he's<00:04:25.800> out<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
for Nicholson to play and he's out so I

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.420 
for Nicholson to play and he's out so I
guess<00:04:29.700> we<00:04:29.820> going<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.420> put<00:04:30.800> Gustavo<00:04:31.800> Ayon<00:04:31.830> and

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
guess we going to put Gustavo Ayon and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.150 
guess we going to put Gustavo Ayon and
give<00:04:32.580> him<00:04:32.730> about<00:04:32.940> three<00:04:33.270> minutes<00:04:38.540> that's<00:04:39.540> just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
give him about three minutes that's just

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.470 
give him about three minutes that's just
this<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:41.550> good<00:04:41.880> but<00:04:42.480> there<00:04:42.660> we<00:04:42.780> go<00:04:44.480> let's

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
this is not good but there we go let's

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.840 
this is not good but there we go let's
go<00:04:45.600> back<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.990> calendar<00:04:46.350> Wow<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:47.700> end

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
go back to the calendar Wow and we end

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.050 
go back to the calendar Wow and we end
up<00:04:47.940> losing<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.810> game<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:49.950> are<00:04:50.190> what

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
up losing in that game so we are what

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.530 
up losing in that game so we are what
three<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.630> three<00:04:52.550> after<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.730> that's

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
three and three after that that's

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.710 
three and three after that that's
possible<00:04:55.020> playoffs<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:59.450> think<00:05:00.450> I'm<00:05:00.510> just<00:05:00.540> going

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
possible playoffs I think I'm just going

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.120 
possible playoffs I think I'm just going
to<00:05:00.780> go<00:05:00.930> ahead<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.110> save<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.440> right<00:05:01.710> here<00:05:01.950> and

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
to go ahead and save it right here and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.080 
to go ahead and save it right here and
keep<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:02.850> like<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:05.370> auto<00:05:05.550> say<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:05.910> myself

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
keep it like it is it auto say so myself

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.540 
keep it like it is it auto say so myself
so<00:05:06.630> I<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.410> worry<00:05:07.590> about<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.950> but<00:05:08.130> it's

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
so I have to worry about it but it's

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.260 
so I have to worry about it but it's
going<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.880> see<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.780> NBA<00:05:10.020> season<00:05:10.530> as<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.890> now

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.900 

heat<00:05:15.270> number<00:05:15.300> one<00:05:15.840> two<00:05:16.260> three<00:05:16.860> four<00:05:17.460> five<00:05:17.490> six

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
heat number one two three four five six

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.050 
heat number one two three four five six
seven<00:05:18.570> eight<00:05:19.080> we<00:05:19.530> are<00:05:19.650> now<00:05:19.830> currently<00:05:20.700> in<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
seven eight we are now currently in the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.440 
seven eight we are now currently in the
eighth<00:05:21.180> spot<00:05:21.479> so<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.729> think<00:05:23.729> we<00:05:24.030> can<00:05:24.180> make<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
eighth spot so I think we can make the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.850 
eighth spot so I think we can make the
playoffs<00:05:24.840> with<00:05:24.990> this<00:05:25.110> roster<00:05:25.350> that<00:05:25.650> we<00:05:25.710> have

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
playoffs with this roster that we have

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.340 
playoffs with this roster that we have
so<00:05:26.040> I'm<00:05:26.130> gonna<00:05:26.340> try<00:05:26.760> this<00:05:26.820> season<00:05:27.479> and<00:05:28.140> see
