plane and tried to make other

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.899 
plane and tried to make other
arrangements<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.460> flight<00:01:53.729> was

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
arrangements because the flight was

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.399 
arrangements because the flight was
going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.270> delayed<00:01:54.659> obviously<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.290> they

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
going to be delayed obviously if they

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.749 
going to be delayed obviously if they
were<00:01:55.470> making<00:01:55.649> connections<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> try

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
were making connections they had to try

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
were making connections they had to try
to<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> other<00:01:57.240> things<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to think of other things to do and it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.719 
to think of other things to do and it
wasn't<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> all<00:01:59.070> clear<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> beginning

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
wasn't it all clear at the beginning

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
wasn't it all clear at the beginning
what<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.479> happen<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.229> flight

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
what was going to happen to that flight

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.109

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so there was a bit of confusion there

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.539
