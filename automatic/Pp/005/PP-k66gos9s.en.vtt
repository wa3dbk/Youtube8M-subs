00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.100 
i heard that this was the best for two
teams<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.950> boring<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.329> sort<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> trial

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
teams with this boring to sort of trial

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
teams with this boring to sort of trial
and<00:02:07.320> error<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.860> everything<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.550> own<00:02:08.700> sort

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and error so everything in my own sort

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.050 
and error so everything in my own sort
of<00:02:09.140> way<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.289> doing<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.160> discovered<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of way of doing things I discovered that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.960 
of way of doing things I discovered that
I<00:02:12.270> much<00:02:12.540> prefer

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
I much prefer

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.350 
I much prefer
into<00:02:13.090> 187<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:15.010> think<00:02:15.100> once<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.610> use<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
into 187 and I think once you use the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.400 
into 187 and I think once you use the
187<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.350> foundation<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:19.540> knew<00:02:19.840> working

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
187 for foundation and I knew working

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
187 for foundation and I knew working
with<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.800> actually<00:02:21.280> use<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:21.880> your

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
with how to actually use it with your

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.210 
with how to actually use it with your
foundation<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.870> don't<00:02:23.530> think<00:02:23.710> he'll<00:02:23.800> ever<00:02:23.920> go

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
foundation I don't think he'll ever go

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.130 
foundation I don't think he'll ever go
back<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.670> flat<00:02:25.030> foundation<00:02:25.270> brush<00:02:25.720> like

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
back to a flat foundation brush like

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
back to a flat foundation brush like
this<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:29.560> one<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:30.010> sometimes<00:02:30.730> used<00:02:30.910> for

this and this one I sometimes used for

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.680 
this and this one I sometimes used for
consider<00:02:31.480> around<00:02:31.810> my<00:02:31.930> eyes<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:34.540> that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
consider around my eyes and but that's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.290 
consider around my eyes and but that's
really<00:02:34.840> all<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.140> never<00:02:35.470> use<00:02:35.710> that<00:02:35.740> for<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:37.060> my

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
so I spray this twice with toner so that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.490 
so I spray this twice with toner so that
one<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.209> get<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> product<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.080> twit<00:02:53.380> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
it and Stephanie the testers I was kind

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.620 
it and Stephanie the testers I was kind
of<00:03:26.950> feeling<00:03:27.160> than<00:03:27.519> when<00:03:27.610> romana<00:03:28.120> kind<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.480> like

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630

oh<00:03:28.660> god<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.370> was<00:03:30.370> really<00:03:30.670> unsure<00:03:30.850> because<00:03:31.269> I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
oh god I was really unsure because I

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.670 
oh god I was really unsure because I
thought<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.750> was<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.080> be<00:03:32.200> really<00:03:32.440> cakey
