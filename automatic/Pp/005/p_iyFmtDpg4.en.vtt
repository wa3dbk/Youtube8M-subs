00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.480 

once<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.110> far<00:01:52.440> maybe<00:01:53.160> even

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
once you get about that far maybe even

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.430 
once you get about that far maybe even
not<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:56.400> take<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.760> scissors<00:01:57.440> and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
not as much just take the scissors and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.000 
not as much just take the scissors and
snip<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.040> her<00:01:59.220> either<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:02.510> then<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.830> take
