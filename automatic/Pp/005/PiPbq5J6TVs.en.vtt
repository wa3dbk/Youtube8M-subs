00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.730
 our knowledge is crushed 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.230

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.870
 animal broth 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.930
 to grind our chile and egypt together 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.540
 like the chile based and already soaked already 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.350
 is totally so soft and the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.319
 tomatoes do this forgiveness are strings 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.180
 boiled I forget that they are measured 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.459

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.140
 we put all the chiles all and what 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.730
 we grind and add it right here and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.489
 we go to the pot where the rabbit is and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.319
 there we did it and immediately we grind the 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.290
 Masita with the broth friend 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.629

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.330
 I deserve 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.970
 what we do we add to the pot 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.980
 and then the dough with the same and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.110
 with the habit of the tomato that the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 I'm also not going to throw away 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.520
 I will occupy for me just as I give a 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.520

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.570
 together with half the tomato and we go and 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.570
 we put it and we give it a collection 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.600
 as you can see there is our code 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.940
 already cooked is our power so now 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.760
 I almost was already sewn who says 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.560
 as well as torn apart but as already 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.930
 you know you could also meals and nothing else 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.480
 but as I want it now if you want 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.030
 but in yellow there is our 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.790
 moment already cooked then I have everything 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.710
 here ground the tomato exercised the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.040
 moments that is the garlic the onion and the 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.920
 oregano and the guajillo chile then 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.040
 we are going to add and here he will remove 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.870
 the garlic the onion that cooks it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.630
 with pieces of onion and a tooth 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.370
 of garlic to get flavor and so much 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.990
 salt because I already had balance and rabbit 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.990
 then come on let's go 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.980
 once 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.650
 to be 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.190
 right here we are going to add our 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.190
 dough 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.919
 here and nothing else is to be caused to 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.819
 the dough because the whole chili was already 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.819
 Cooked 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.090
 with what he used the mass for what species that 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:38.180
 is our mass for us to do this 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.640
 site and I thought to show our yellow 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.710
 and here in water we are going to add the 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.440

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.930
