00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 how to treat your colonies with acid 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.660
 formic it is important to have 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 always the coldest formic acid 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.210
 possible to limit the vapors they 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.799
 emerge before your manipulations 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 place your formic acid bottle 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.010
 in the freezer and take it out just before 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010
 to manipulate 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.400
 when manipulating when one makes a dilution to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 the acid always put the water first 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.269
 in the container and then the side car 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.439
 the exothermic reaction and can be 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.750
 dangerous if we put the cee'd the water on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.860
 the sinne 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.360
 so my supplier nine years of the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.000
 target at 80% that I will add in the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 local that already contains the water and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.739
 formic acid coming out of the freezer 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.670
 then I put it in a 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.590
 icebox for it to be cold 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.550
 when I'm going to the colonies to 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.379
 not have steam then I all of 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.850
 next I place a box under the hive 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.020
 for already that the diffusion of 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.990
 formic acid is more correct too 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.790
 to control the effect of treatment 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.190
 then I prepare my clothes acid 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 formic were stored in the small 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.600
 cooler plays the column 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.730
 and of course I always wear 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.900
 gloves and long sleeves because 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.990
 the formic acid projections are 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.490
 very dangerous so formic acid 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 I leave it with a simple cut m 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.900
 sometimes for a little fat totu the cards 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.980
 for the right soil cup I 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.750
 pourais this family that we will cut 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.530
 so I did 40 minutes for a 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.230
 big colony and 20 minutes for our 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.280
 riches and about 15 min 15 20 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.040
 minutes for a black body and I put back 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.690
 my feed back to the top and 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.100
 I close and it's really collared 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.350
 treated I could control the falls 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.179
 the next day do not hesitate to invite 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.420
 other videos on my site and thank you for 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.420
 your attention
