00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
look at the case the case itself is a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.319 
look at the case the case itself is a
really<00:01:51.750> thick<00:01:52.189> hard<00:01:53.189> case<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.939> got<00:01:54.090> nice

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
really thick hard case so it's got nice

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.770 
really thick hard case so it's got nice
hard<00:01:54.659> TPU<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:56.360> inside<00:01:57.360> we've<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hard TPU and then inside we've got a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350 
hard TPU and then inside we've got a

little piece of styrofoam here or the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.520 
little piece of styrofoam here or the
foam<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.170> let<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.380> ahead<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
foam would go so let me go ahead and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.069 
foam would go so let me go ahead and
take<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:02.450> take<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> look<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.810> rest<00:02:03.960> of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
s6 right on there so I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.410 
s6 right on there so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:14.739> put<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.920> galaxy<00:03:15.280> s6<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.820> there<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.360> you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and put the galaxy s6 in there so you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.780 
and put the galaxy s6 in there so you
can<00:03:16.540> see<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.380> s6<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:17.950> seated<00:03:18.310> right<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.610> there

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
can see the s6 is seated right in there

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.449 
can see the s6 is seated right in there
now<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:20.019> once<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.620> s6<00:03:21.010> seated

now so once you have the s6 seated
inside<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.840> inner<00:03:23.260> portion<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> case<00:03:24.310> you

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
inside the inner portion of the case you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.250 
inside the inner portion of the case you
can<00:03:24.640> see<00:03:24.760> they're<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.060> bumper<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.049> a<00:03:26.110> two

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
part case it's gonna fit right in here

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.820 
part case it's gonna fit right in here
so<00:03:28.299> what<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.510> want<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.870> since<00:03:29.590> there's

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
so what you want to do since there's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.530 
so what you want to do since there's
this<00:03:29.980> piece<00:03:30.280> here<00:03:30.670> that's<00:03:30.910> sticking<00:03:31.209> out<00:03:31.390> of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
this piece here that's sticking out of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.870 
this piece here that's sticking out of
the<00:03:31.600> side<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.440> see<00:03:32.650> right<00:03:32.860> there<00:03:32.920> if<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the side you can see right there if you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.580 
the side you can see right there if you
look<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.480> sides<00:03:34.720> not<00:03:34.989> completely<00:03:35.350> flush

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
look the sides not completely flush

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.590 
look the sides not completely flush
there's<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.250> piece<00:03:36.489> sticking<00:03:36.700> out<00:03:36.970> there's<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
there's a piece sticking out there's a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.180 
there's a piece sticking out there's a
hole<00:03:37.810> right<00:03:37.840> there<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.470> side<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.920> case

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
hole right there on the side of the case

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.070 
hole right there on the side of the case
that<00:03:39.940> we're<00:03:40.060> gonna<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.450> stick<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.840> in

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
that we're gonna have to stick that in

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.320 
that we're gonna have to stick that in
so<00:03:41.380> if<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.040> stick<00:03:42.310> one<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.730> those<00:03:42.910> right<00:03:43.209> in

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
so if you stick one of those right in

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.539 
so if you stick one of those right in
the<00:03:43.420> hole<00:03:43.680> you're<00:03:44.680> gonna<00:03:44.799> have<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.070> pull<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
the hole you're gonna have to pull the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.789 
the hole you're gonna have to pull the
other<00:03:45.580> side<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.420> soft<00:03:46.690> shell<00:03:46.930> outward<00:03:47.530> and

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
other side of the soft shell outward and

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.699 
other side of the soft shell outward and
then<00:03:48.430> snap<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:48.850> into<00:03:49.180> place<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:50.560> will

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
then snap it into place and that will

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.009 
then snap it into place and that will
get<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.040> inside<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.670> case<00:03:51.910> right<00:03:52.750> there

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
get the inside of the case right there

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.860 
get the inside of the case right there
so<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.470> can<00:03:53.590> see<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.370> case<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.090> securely

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
so you can see now the case is securely

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.759 
so you can see now the case is securely
on<00:03:56.080> my<00:03:56.260> s6<00:03:56.709> two-part<00:03:57.220> case<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:58.500> let's<00:03:59.500> check

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
on my s6 two-part case and let's check

sturdy case it does add a bit of bulk to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.580 
sturdy case it does add a bit of bulk to
your<00:04:39.490> s6<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:40.330> that's<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.020> price<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.410> pay<00:04:41.440> for

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
drop protection but it doesn't add as

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.510 
drop protection but it doesn't add as
much<00:04:43.990> bulk<00:04:44.320> as<00:04:44.470> something<00:04:44.800> like<00:04:44.890> an<00:04:45.070> Otterbox

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
much bulk as something like an Otterbox

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.670 
much bulk as something like an Otterbox
case<00:04:45.700> it<00:04:46.330> still<00:04:46.600> got<00:04:46.780> less<00:04:46.990> bulk<00:04:47.290> than<00:04:47.500> that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
case it still got less bulk than that

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.550 
case it still got less bulk than that
but<00:04:48.310> you've<00:04:48.430> got<00:04:48.640> nice<00:04:49.180> impact<00:04:49.930> resistant

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
but you've got nice impact resistant

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.900 
but you've got nice impact resistant
edges<00:04:50.890> here<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:51.400> you've<00:04:51.520> got<00:04:51.610> extra

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
edges here so you've got extra

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.880

protection<00:04:52.450> around<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.750> edges<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.770> when

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
protection around the edges so that when

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.560 
protection around the edges so that when
you<00:04:53.980> drop<00:04:54.160> your<00:04:54.370> phone<00:04:54.610> it's<00:04:55.270> going<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.480> hit

you drop your phone it's going to hit
around<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.900> edges<00:04:56.260> more<00:04:56.650> likely<00:04:57.010> than<00:04:57.190> not

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
around the edges more likely than not

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.130 
around the edges more likely than not
that's<00:04:57.910> going<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.240> protect<00:04:58.510> your<00:04:58.690> phone<00:04:58.870> on
