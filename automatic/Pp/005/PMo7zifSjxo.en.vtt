00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
able to print you want to make sure that
you<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> printer<00:00:34.649> setup<00:00:34.950> installed

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you have the printer setup installed

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
you have the printer setup installed
configured<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> currently<00:00:37.710> working

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
configured and it is currently working

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.090 
configured and it is currently working
on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.910> network<00:00:39.239> now<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.170> network<00:00:40.559> printer<00:00:40.739> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
on the network now a network printer is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
on the network now a network printer is
a<00:00:41.129> printer<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.550> connects<00:00:42.059> directly<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a printer that connects directly to the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
a printer that connects directly to the
router<00:00:43.170> through<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.070> Ethernet<00:00:44.520> port<00:00:44.550> or

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
router through an Ethernet port or

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.229 
router through an Ethernet port or
wirelessly<00:00:45.750> through<00:00:45.899> Wi-Fi<00:00:46.350> technology

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
wirelessly through Wi-Fi technology

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.639 
wirelessly through Wi-Fi technology
however<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.510> printer<00:00:48.840> needs<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
however that printer needs to be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
however that printer needs to be
identified<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.370> identifiable<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
identified or identifiable on the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
identified or identifiable on the
network<00:00:52.020> before<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> Mac<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
network before the Mac can see that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450 
network before the Mac can see that
printer<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.500> tutorial<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
printer so in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
printer so in this tutorial I'm going to
assume<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.120> already<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.170> network

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
assume you already have a network

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830 
assume you already have a network
printer<00:00:58.850> set<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.149> configured<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.809> your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
printer set up and configured on your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.869 
printer set up and configured on your
network<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.800> Mac<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> simply<00:01:02.670> just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
network and this Mac is simply just

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.899 
network and this Mac is simply just
going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> connect<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> via<00:01:04.739> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.070> so

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
going to connect to it via Wi-Fi so

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.410 
going to connect to it via Wi-Fi so
let's<00:01:06.420> begin<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:07.130> order<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.280> add<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.850> network

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
let's begin in order to add the network

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990 
let's begin in order to add the network
printer<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.320> able<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> print<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
printer or to be able to print to the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
printer or to be able to print to the
network<00:01:12.570> printer<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> first<00:01:13.439> thing<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> want

actually<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.460> two<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.180> it's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually have two of them so it's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
actually have two of them so it's
probably<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:03.899> confusing<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:04.829> Mac

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
probably a little confusing for my Mac

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
probably a little confusing for my Mac
but<00:02:05.310> today<00:02:05.969> I'm<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.270> add<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> one

function<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.480> printer<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.260> really<00:02:24.130> do

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
function this printer I really do

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.340 
function this printer I really do
recommend<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.210> solid<00:02:25.690> printer<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.230> can

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
recommend it's a solid printer you can

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.780 
recommend it's a solid printer you can
pretty<00:02:26.590> much<00:02:26.680> pick<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.190> up<00:02:27.310> anywhere

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
pretty much pick it up anywhere

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.480 
pretty much pick it up anywhere
including<00:02:28.690> Amazon<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> very<00:02:30.130> good<00:02:30.280> price

so<00:02:30.900> going<00:02:31.900> back<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.110> adding<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> printer

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
so going back to adding the printer

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.080 
so going back to adding the printer
let's<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.090> done<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> add<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> printer

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
let's get that done so to add a printer

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.000 
let's get that done so to add a printer
or<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.390> add<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> network<00:02:37.810> printer<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.740> want<00:02:38.890> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
or to add a network printer you want to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.850 
or to add a network printer you want to
select<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:40.240> plus<00:02:40.690> sign<00:02:40.990> down<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:41.770> the

select on the plus sign down here on the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.490 
select on the plus sign down here on the
bottom<00:02:42.010> left<00:02:42.660> now<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:43.810> you're<00:02:43.960> not<00:02:44.080> able<00:02:44.290> to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
select that plus sign it's probably

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.510 
select that plus sign it's probably
probably<00:02:48.460> because<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.630> locked<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.980> in

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
probably because it is locked so in

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.850 
probably because it is locked so in
order<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.000> add<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.140> unlock<00:02:53.590> to
