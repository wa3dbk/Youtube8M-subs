00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello everyone with you crazy ted and welcome 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.719
 to craft craft 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.639
 I apologize in advance for taking me long 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.770
 time was not understand holidays themselves 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.470
 but also to account for such grief as it happened in 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.199
 I got hijacked Steam account with all of them 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.840
 knives there other things in total worth 25 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.779
 Thousands of rubles 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.699
 understood so much time spent 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.769
 Here is such a trouble so on this 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.850
 I can only say that you will 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.680
 very very neat here and account on 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.650
 Well, that is my second account I give you 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.150
 Throw in the description so that you are not yet 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.879
 transitioned because it will be possible 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.900
 the cracker still deceives you somehow 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.790
 so be careful and what am I 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.979
 I want to show you enough today 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.409
 interesting mechanism I would even call 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:00.000
 unexpected mechanism in general here we have 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:03.120
 there is a lever and by pressing it 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
 we are pushing the court under the floor and here already 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 worth the enchantment table where we can 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.760
 what not to enchant as you are beautiful 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 You know, but also the whole thing 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.120
 closes here that is essentially i why 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.619
 decided to make such a mechanism is not exactly in 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.350
 first there was no secondly he 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.500
 really unexpectedly that's it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 unexpected because usually the same as we 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.380
 represented all see the whole when 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.280
 out from under the floors it is pushed here as if in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.720
 semi mechanism is simple enough let's 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 I 'll show you first 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 before we start and arrange here he gave 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.369
 so here is my room 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.890
 the whole mechanism looks like it is very 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 small very simple and by the way it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.259
 one of the advantages is what can be done 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.880
 let's explain everything right there chamber 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 moves and you can say here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 well, I donâ€™t know there is a stove winters 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 then you just put it in here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.009
 the oven and it will fall anyway 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.649
 there is work you can do this 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.720
 small warehouse so to speak in the floor well in 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 Generally not the point so let's 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.549
 turn to him the construction of such 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.890
 pad with what we start 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.239
 We'll start immediately with the backdoor 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.459
 There is because eyeliner pretty 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.890
 interesting on being built as follows 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.010
 so here we spend redstone and put 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.989
 block repeaters without delay but here already 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.070
 lever here so that there is on the foot 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.840
 activate the whole thing is here now 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.660
 caught the construction of the main unit 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 help here do this platform from 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.460
 eight blocks we put a repeater and here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.970
 slices rostov over let's go here 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.080
 red torch here is another block 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.780
 red torch and here we put it like this 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.500
 blocks and also put a bunch of repeaters 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.100
 and a bunch of redstone pieces so now 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 here we leave so here is a repeater without 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.880
 lyalya delays here sticky plunger on 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.290
 him on sub block here one more was here 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.620
 like that like that now wait like that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 so here we put the blocks and you're still here 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.120
 so here we put a repeater without delay 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.890
 there is a piece of the cabin that is so signal 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.700
 stock and here is another repeater 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.030
 delay in the games go a little bit of red 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.850
 so now let us not 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 at first we will expose still so sharply 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.710
 we will make the whole structure later 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.470
 put I think all the pistons 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.170
 here we put there a piece relaxed 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.120
 further there is also a block 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.720
 also here is another block here respectively 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.640
 we are already making a platform 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.770
 Now with you how it is built there 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 he could have been like that 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.590
 there are no repeaters and so here 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.770
 signal is carried out here too 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.360
 put a repeater of course which 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:00.970
 I forgot and here we do the same area 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:03.230
 like this we put a repeater and and here from 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:08.450
 Right 5 Rostov 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.510
 and here we put a repeater everything is left 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.489
 just a phrase 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.430
 put a couple of pieces of redstone on 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.199
 semi blocks that's because the blocks 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.070
 go bit by bit again but now everyone 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.040
 principle can be put sticky pistons 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.690
 yes how about us then everything will move 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.380
 gas should essentially no so our producer 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:38.750
 one block higher up like that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:44.930
 circle put our sticky pistons like this 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.930
 it turns out still here here now 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.669
 respectively, these blocks 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.370
 Well, I use land tanks in a cartoon 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 any others now immediately activate 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.050
 our mechanism here we all went out of 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.050
 there is sex 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.819
 as well as not so here we try again 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.440
 yes that's all for moved here 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.710
 Respectively, too, which piece is not 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.039
 block here we will have a stove and here 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.289
 video also stove or bitch goal let's 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.500
 let's make us such a short release 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.680
 can do something like 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.430
 let's say in the floor dahua you in advance 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.629
 then show 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.560
 got to do everything let's say to the class here 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:39.610
 not earth opa and accordingly how 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:44.159
 It will look like we just take it 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.110
 so here it is all closed in blocks a 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:49.389
 here you are full 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.490
 accordingly we will put with you here 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.800
 so thats the stairs that is so that they 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.580
 the sides looked like full blocks 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.960
 here we put them here and under them already 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.610
 accordingly, you can put 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.400
 what thread chests 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.850
 now we will do it all 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.820
 here and here somehow it will be necessary to cook 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.490
 put these chests hold take 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.390
 their chest workbenches 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.150
 so then let yours on the workbench here 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:25.310
 account more precisely double chest lego universe 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:30.070
 take so mode stove put another one 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:33.050
 bake this stove workbench then this here 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.160
 you can still put well and let it be still 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.550
 so a couple of steps 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.380
 just like that let's say you will be so 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.910
 warehouse to put it mildly yes and put here 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.580
 respectively, the blocks well, that is one 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.860
 block like this well and all this can be rolled up 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:56.750
 still under the floor close open 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:58.880
 close here even here and here all 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.870
 closed here you have let's say nothing 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.160
 no and click here you are moving 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.740
 and you can calmly 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.200
 what not to take from here but to bring 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.480
 somehow lever closer from here to in 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.030
 the attack could from here press the lever and 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.320
 you raised up in general that's all 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.970
 Thank you all so much for watching. 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.500
 put your thumbs up 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.020
 comment subscribe to my 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.480
 the channel and you were crazy that all good 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.990
 everybody good luck and see you next
