stumble upon the seed I was just

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.160 
stumble upon the seed I was just
creating<00:00:14.160> random<00:00:14.460> worlds<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.269> found<00:00:15.540> my

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
creating random worlds and I found my

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.050 
creating random worlds and I found my
own<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.529> survival<00:00:16.949> island<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.910> guys

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
own little survival island that you guys

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
own little survival island that you guys
might<00:00:18.300> enjoy<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.869> check<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.170> out<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.920> spawn

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
might enjoy so check this out you spawn

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
might enjoy so check this out you spawn
right<00:00:20.369> over<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:20.789> somewhere<00:00:21.029> i<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.480> that's

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
right over here somewhere i think that's

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.810 
right over here somewhere i think that's
where<00:00:22.590> i<00:00:22.619> respawned<00:00:23.010> when<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> killed<00:00:23.670> myself

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
where i respawned when I killed myself

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.439 
where i respawned when I killed myself
anyway<00:00:24.390> um<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.820> flat

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
anyway um and you get this little flat

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.290 
anyway um and you get this little flat
piece<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> grass<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.119> come

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
piece of grass here and then you come

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590 
piece of grass here and then you come
over<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:32.090> there's<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.480> little

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
over here and there's actually a little

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950 
over here and there's actually a little
glitch<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> water<00:00:35.719> kind<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> does

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
glitch right here the water kind of does

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
glitch right here the water kind of does
a<00:00:37.850> physics<00:00:38.850> glitch<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.879> then<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> come

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a physics glitch here but then you come

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
a physics glitch here but then you come
over<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
over here and you have a little bit of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
over here and you have a little bit of
gap<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
gap right here that you can make like a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
gap right here that you can make like a
bridge<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.870> something<00:00:46.050> across<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.579> some

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
bridge or something across you got some

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
bridge or something across you got some
sand<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.989> tree<00:00:49.309> right

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
sand and then you have one tree right

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.430 
sand and then you have one tree right
here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.399> survival<00:00:53.940> island

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
here and that is your survival island

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.569 
here and that is your survival island
you've<00:00:55.440> got<00:00:55.590> plenty<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.890> squid<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.430> here

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you've got plenty of squid around here

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.040 
you've got plenty of squid around here
but<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.730> mean<00:00:56.879> look<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:57.660> just

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.970 
but I mean look at it it's all just
ocean<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.350> far<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.620> caves

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
ocean and that is it so as far as caves

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
ocean and that is it so as far as caves
and<00:01:02.219> stuff<00:01:02.309> let's<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.379> haven't<00:01:04.379> checked

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and stuff let's see I haven't checked

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.730 
and stuff let's see I haven't checked
this<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:05.040> yet<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.049> we<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.680> good

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this out yet but we do have some good

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.380 
this out yet but we do have some good
cave<00:01:08.130> systems<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.970> underneath<00:01:09.330> here

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
cave systems going on underneath here

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
cave systems going on underneath here
this<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> well<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:15.950> there's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> little

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this side is well so there's a little

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.499 
this side is well so there's a little
dungeon<00:01:17.340> over<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.759> too<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:20.180> yeah<00:01:21.180> there's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
dungeon over there too and yeah there's

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.620 
dungeon over there too and yeah there's
there's<00:01:21.750> plenty<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> room<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:24.060> around<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
there's plenty of room to go around and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.800 
there's plenty of room to go around and
let's<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.720> look<00:01:27.720> at

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
let's what is this down here look at

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
let's what is this down here look at
that<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> direct<00:01:29.189> access<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that you have kind of direct access to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390 
that you have kind of direct access to
if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.150> right<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.310> like

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
if you come right here it looks like

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.429 
if you come right here it looks like
when<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.790> turn<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.360> night<00:01:33.540> vision<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:34.079> um

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
when we turn on my night vision here um

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.399 
when we turn on my night vision here um
you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> nice<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.869> guess<00:01:39.869> under

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you have a nice little I guess under

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.210 
you have a nice little I guess under
hang<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:42.290> maybe<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.979> put

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
hang right here and maybe that will put

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
hang right here and maybe that will put
you<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.549> closer<00:01:44.759> let's<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> can

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you a little closer let's see if I can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.719 
you a little closer let's see if I can
get<00:01:45.780> back<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.939> um<00:01:49.460> not<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.670> much

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
get back up here and look um not so much

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
get back up here and look um not so much
I<00:01:51.060> mean<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> guess<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> could<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I mean I guess you could go there and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.969 
I mean I guess you could go there and
dig<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:54.590> yeah<00:01:55.590> there's<00:01:55.829> definitely

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
dig down but yeah there's definitely

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
dig down but yeah there's definitely
caves<00:01:56.490> under<00:01:56.880> here<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.630> dig

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
caves under here you just have to dig

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.670 
caves under here you just have to dig
down<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.259> them<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.210> lava<00:02:00.680> right

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
down to them and there's some lava right

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.800 
down to them and there's some lava right
there<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.820> yeah<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> guys<00:02:03.329> might<00:02:03.570> want<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
got a little bit of a cave here and you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.479 
got a little bit of a cave here and you
guys<00:02:52.380> saw<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.650> there's<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.100> pretty<00:02:53.280> massive

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
guys saw that there's a pretty massive

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.060 
guys saw that there's a pretty massive
cave<00:02:53.910> system<00:02:54.269> under<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.530> i'm<00:02:55.650> sure<00:02:55.680> this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
cave system under here so i'm sure this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.240 
cave system under here so i'm sure this
connects<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:58.080> again<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.440> out<00:02:58.920> there<00:02:59.100> some

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
connects so again just out there some

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.800 
connects so again just out there some
more<00:02:59.340> iron<00:02:59.550> right<00:02:59.760> there<00:02:59.940> again<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.630> go<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
more iron right there again just go to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.530 
more iron right there again just go to
this<00:03:01.050> island<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.890> tree<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.239> part

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
this island with the tree in this part

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.350 
this island with the tree in this part
that<00:03:03.780> curves<00:03:04.350> inward<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> inside<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that curves inward like the inside of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.620 
that curves inward like the inside of
the<00:03:06.570> sea<00:03:06.810> i<00:03:07.019> guess<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.500> could<00:03:07.709> say<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:09.420> come

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the sea i guess you could say just come

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.720 
the sea i guess you could say just come
down<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.950> all<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.280> had<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.459> do<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
down here and you all I had to do is

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.420 
down here and you all I had to do is
break<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.239> block<00:03:12.540> right<00:03:12.989> there<00:03:13.220> or<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.280> could

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
break one block right there or you could

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.040 
break one block right there or you could
have<00:03:14.519> even<00:03:14.610> gone<00:03:14.820> down<00:03:14.880> right<00:03:15.360> here<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.690> not

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
have even gone down right here and not

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.170 
have even gone down right here and not
have<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.290> break<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> blog<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.150> go
