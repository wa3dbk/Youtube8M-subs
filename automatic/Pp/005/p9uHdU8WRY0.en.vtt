00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.520
 then first of all you need to download 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.349
 here it is, you will have this folder 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.130

 here you have this folder 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.810
 then now you have to create one first 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 new folder 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.050
 a single iso file will succeed 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.810
 then now to open the iso file 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.690
 you need to have a program called the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.930
 usual or another program 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.740
 which opened which opens the iso files okay me 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.899

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.470

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.100

 predefined ahead in the stable 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.510
 now guys I pause for a moment 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.010
 and continuous when the installation will be 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 over 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:38.620
 here we are boys of installation is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:38.620
 almost finished it is installing the saying 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760
 come on 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.920
 here it is finished 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:18.060
 now as you see v will tell you the game away 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.450
 it's clearly how everyone gets me there 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.620
 will ask for the product key 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:33.350
 then now go to the folder where 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:37.340
 you have an alcatel imi e torrent folder 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.340
 copy this 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.500
 paste 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.980
 next 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.680
 ok 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.659
 now the game will start then 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.470
 race one last thing 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.769
 as you know me on a tower all 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.040
 wing file simulator need to 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.379
 insert the disc to be able to play in 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.799
 this case we don't have it on 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.360
 disk because we cracked it that is 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.599
 happen 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.799
 however we have installed from the internet 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:19.370
 so either you find the crack on the internet 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:22.250
 I didn't do it because that is why it exists 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.470
 a simple way even without putting the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.430
 crack almost every time you want 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:33.410
 play just open the file iso ed 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.810
 you will succeed will farming will tell you away 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.030
 the game uninstalls those crap the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.669
 so pretty much practically there 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.940
 you can simply play a last 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:52.760
 what would make me so happy if you go 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:05:01.340

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:05.660
