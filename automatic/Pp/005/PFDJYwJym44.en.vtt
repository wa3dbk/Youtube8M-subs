of pioneering scientists it was that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.100 
of pioneering scientists it was that
compelling<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.120> evidence<00:02:15.540> has<00:02:15.900> been

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
compelling so the evidence has been

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320 
compelling so the evidence has been
really<00:02:16.709> interesting<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.180> an

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
anniversary of 9/11 we have planned a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.839 
anniversary of 9/11 we have planned a
piece<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.020> tension<00:02:28.379> experiment<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.190> like

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
piece in tension experiment just like

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.490 
piece in tension experiment just like
the<00:02:30.000> piece<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.390> tension<00:02:30.720> experiment<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.470> ran

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the piece in tension experiment we ran

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.290 
the piece in tension experiment we ran
at<00:02:32.069> Sri<00:02:32.519> Lanka<00:02:33.050> when<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.170> did<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.739> 2008<00:02:35.580> we

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
at Sri Lanka when we did that in 2008 we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
at Sri Lanka when we did that in 2008 we
had<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> team<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.930> scientists<00:02:37.500> monitoring<00:02:38.129> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
had a team of scientists monitoring and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.080 
had a team of scientists monitoring and
we<00:02:38.519> found<00:02:39.110> profound<00:02:40.110> effects<00:02:41.090> demonstrating

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
we found profound effects demonstrating

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.170 
we found profound effects demonstrating
group<00:02:42.300> mind<00:02:42.629> we<00:02:43.230> also<00:02:43.440> found<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:44.010> 74<00:02:44.670> percent

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
group mind we also found a 74 percent

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.300 
group mind we also found a 74 percent
lowering<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.900> violence<00:02:46.319> after<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.920> effect

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
lowering of violence after the effect

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.050 
lowering of violence after the effect
after<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.030> event<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.580> significant<00:02:50.580> changes

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
after the event and significant changes

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.320 
after the event and significant changes
in<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> war<00:02:51.629> which<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.620> 25-year<00:02:53.489> war<00:02:53.760> ended

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
in the war which that 25-year war ended

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.559 
in the war which that 25-year war ended
seven<00:02:55.019> months<00:02:55.290> after<00:02:55.440> our<00:02:55.739> experiment<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
seven months after our experiment and it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.660 
seven months after our experiment and it
appeared<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.500> during<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> eight<00:02:59.220> days<00:02:59.489> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
appeared that during the eight days of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.500 
appeared that during the eight days of
our<00:02:59.790> experiment<00:03:00.599> an<00:03:01.500> enormous<00:03:02.310> shift<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
our experiment an enormous shift in the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.759 
our experiment an enormous shift in the
whole<00:03:03.690> politics<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.209> war<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:07.170> we

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
whole politics of the of the war now we

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.649 
whole politics of the of the war now we
don't<00:03:08.010> know<00:03:08.129> what<00:03:08.310> we<00:03:08.550> did<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.030> when<00:03:09.540> you

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
don't know what we did this when you

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.780 
don't know what we did this when you
have<00:03:09.870> one<00:03:10.230> experiment<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.069> have<00:03:11.099> no<00:03:11.430> proof

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
have one experiment you have no proof

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
have one experiment you have no proof
and<00:03:12.060> that's<00:03:12.780> why<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:12.989> scientists<00:03:13.560> seek<00:03:13.769> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and that's why I scientists seek to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.640 
and that's why I scientists seek to
replicate<00:03:14.610> over<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.180> over<00:03:15.510> again<00:03:15.629> and<00:03:16.080> that's

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
replicate over and over again and that's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.290 
replicate over and over again and that's
what<00:03:16.890> we're<00:03:17.040> planning<00:03:17.280> with<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.760> piece<00:03:18.090> in

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
what we're planning with this piece in

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.390 
what we're planning with this piece in
