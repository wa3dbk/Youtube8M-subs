 The Sankei Osaka Cup last week became a bad Baba race due to bad weather 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 Was the target 1.4 times as overwhelmingly popular as the salmon that was originally cut off? 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.550
 It became the Teku to the unfortunate and of the mares bought 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.559

 Then I will do my best to deliver the expected for you this week 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 Then we think that we want to go to village this week 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.829
 Of course this week's featured race is the cherry blossom award 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.320
 Great place in Kurama Classic Round 1 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.040
 Distribution in the past of the winning horse Star and shops tilde do is add feathers and Buena Vista 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.619
 Daiwa Scarlet such as historical name female is Zurari District 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.649
 Also it is going to be a pace that fun and very war 3 horses horse to Yumean this year 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 My prediction of such summer sickness 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.610
 Well 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.800
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.780
 Yes 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 100 specs was also you now 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.040
 The strongest in the 3-year-old of this year include stallion I be the strength of the self-explanatory with regard Rouge back 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 I think 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.770
 I continued to fight for two battles and fascinated bread with shocking raw legs from behind 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:52.160
 Go for the previous run of the stallion at the Kisaragi Award 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.600
 Once you get superiority in the first place in the act you get out straight ahead and go up to the goal in the fastest 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.030
 I ran through 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.250
 Running without putting any high speed is a word of masterpiece 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.050
 Thank you 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:09.479
 I think it is the first win and lose if it is the Hanshin outskirts whose ability is easy to directly connect to the results 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:16.769
 I also expect the opponent to be unbeaten Queensling 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:19.739
 It is 2 times with 1600 meters of Nakayama which is extremely disadvantageous and the outer frame is overwhelming that your rape flower prize is very bad. 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:26.660
 I was able to easily win with two horses 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:30.580
 The Datte 10 likely heard Nakagachi not the 20 kg and this tone Yes eggplant is testament to the high capacity 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.090
 Today along the street is desperately Viebas 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.220
 The tulip award set is rapidly growing 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.670
 &amp; Rie 's solid hearted love also seems to be a good top aim 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 It is cat coin not to forget afterward 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 This horse is also unbeaten and should be watched 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:58.150

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:01.150
