00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.660
 piece of lesson we have prepared for 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.600
 today especially for the most novice gray 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.420
 to freak out this is a led was in all 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.920
 rule scales sale chronicles majors and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.970
 minors you will learn them in a 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.550
 minute nothing to count the frets nothing 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.259
 of singing the notes we are not going to take a 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.029
 bit of what the scale is 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.849
 pentatonic around the mast we're not going to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.680
 come to the frets 5 ok let's go to 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.020
 use the frets five of the six 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:43.040
 strings and we will accompany you 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 with the frets 87 77 88 of the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 successive strings I said it's going to be 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.620
 simple and you will learn it then 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 so what you have to do is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 have the fingers and the drawing is the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.930
 next 14 or 21 and 24 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.800
 ting ting ting 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.800
 13 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.759
 14 14 as you have seen we started 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.340
 always you fret 5 of all strings 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:21.630
 and then we do 5 807 107 57.88 for 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.539
 what we are interested in is the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 drawing and the drawing is 14 13 13 13 14 14 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.369
 It's good, well, with that drawing we have 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.310
 made the minor pentatonic scale in a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.530
 scene because we started on the 5th fret 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110
 of the sexist rope is the tonic note 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 well then I repeat 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 14 13 13 this is the eighth then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.660
 it would also be nothing tonic 13 14 14 as 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.660
 we have said the minor pentatonic scale 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.530
 in a but what happens if I take it with me 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.650
 this same drawing I put two frets under 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.170
 tonic note would be this 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:08.360
 what is the yes and then 14 13 13 13 14 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 14 we would have on the pentatonic scale 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.010
 smaller itself this anywhere from 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.720
 the guitar that we do we have the 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.380
 minor pentatonic scale of the note 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.080
 where we start is simple but 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.160
 bis now have the ninja move as 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.070
 let's run for fun if we have 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 and the position it put your finger 1 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.040
 the fret 5 and the finger 4 on the fret 8 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.630
 what are we going to pay attention to this what 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.370
 as well so that it looks good I'm going to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.530
 so you have a lesson so that you 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.580
 stay with the copy this is the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.580
 movement online 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 you have flip in bright colleague colors 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.880
 Well maybe not yet because I do not know what 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.710
 I have explained 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 with this movement it is worth 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.990
 what we do is with the same drawing 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.660
 we have the largest pentatonic scale in a 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.100
 it's worth it, yes, keeping the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.290
 crimes in position 14 the furniture 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.640
 until finger 4 matches the note 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 tonic of the scale in minor 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.330
 ok now I explain that they are the most 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.820
 simple 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.820
 what will happen is that we have the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.000
 larger scale of that note doing the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.640
 same drawing of 11 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.010
 613 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.519
 then with that little drawing of 14 13 103 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.930
 13 14 14 we take out the biggest pentatonics 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.930
 and under any note 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.450
 minor pentatonic in a is worth that tonic 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.760
 the tonic note goes on the finger one 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.790
 Greater pentatonic in the is the same 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.160
 drawing but on the tonic note it goes on the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.560
 four vouchers that we have to run for 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.380
 yes then we have the largest scale and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.660
 minor of the and this happens all the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.360
 frets so it's infinite that you shit 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.310
 when they open ice to nava do not have 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.840
 process in your head warns flip 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.540
 in colors of what you have learned and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.560
 now it 's day 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.320
 let's do one already we're not going to touch on 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:41.630
 nothing greater average ear for bulerÃ­as 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.380
 I hope you liked that I criticized 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.950
 that you share 50 free points before 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.950
 a greeting
