hello<00:00:01.079> again<00:00:02.330> snapshot<00:00:03.740> 12w<00:00:04.879> 22a<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.779> out<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.879 

beside<00:00:10.650> many<00:00:11.070> few<00:00:12.080> i'll<00:00:13.080> bug<00:00:13.469> fixes<00:00:13.860> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
beside many few i'll bug fixes and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000 
beside many few i'll bug fixes and
changes<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.990> example<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> enchantment

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
changes in for example the enchantment

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.060 
changes in for example the enchantment
system<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.390> trading<00:00:18.720> system<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.949> also

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
system and the trading system you also

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.060 
system and the trading system you also
got<00:00:20.250> new<00:00:20.490> feature<00:00:21.199> trapwire<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> trip<00:00:24.390> wire<00:00:24.570> is

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.550 

basically<00:00:29.359> an<00:00:30.359> advanced<00:00:30.900> version<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
basically an advanced version of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.709 
basically an advanced version of
pressure<00:00:32.369> plates<00:00:34.760> can<00:00:35.760> lay<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.149> string

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
pressure plates can lay down with string

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.310 
pressure plates can lay down with string
and<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> whole<00:00:38.239> thing<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.510> 90<00:00:40.079> blocks

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and the whole thing can be 90 blocks

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
and the whole thing can be 90 blocks
long<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.460> every<00:00:41.700> time<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.910> step<00:00:42.360> or<00:00:43.050> any<00:00:43.410> other

here hold and receive power so that way

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.150 
here hold and receive power so that way
you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.289> make<00:00:55.739> trip<00:00:56.340> wire<00:00:56.579> wiring<00:00:57.949> ignore<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you can make trip wire wiring ignore the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
you can make trip wire wiring ignore the
big<00:01:00.000> party<00:01:00.539> set<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.879> it's<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.359> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
big party set up in here it's just I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.580 
big party set up in here it's just I
want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.470> working<00:01:04.860> prototype<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:06.590> not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
want to have a working prototype and not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
want to have a working prototype and not
a<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.710> compact<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.110> show

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a very compact one so I can just show

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219 
a very compact one so I can just show
you<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:10.950> turn<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> feeder<00:01:12.119> i<00:01:12.450> used<00:01:12.990> two

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you it i turn the feeder i used two

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.890 
you it i turn the feeder i used two
pistons<00:01:13.650> alternatively<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.180> what

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pistons alternatively you could use what

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.130 
pistons alternatively you could use what
channel<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:16.560> were<00:01:17.340> schnapps<00:01:17.820> i<00:01:18.119> use<00:01:18.930> well

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
channel which were schnapps i use well

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
channel which were schnapps i use well
down<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.580> on<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> trip<00:01:21.180> wire<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
down here on to the trip wire and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
down here on to the trip wire and
another<00:01:21.840> piston<00:01:22.320> single<00:01:23.189> piston<00:01:23.340> who<00:01:23.640> pushed

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
another piston single piston who pushed

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.590 
another piston single piston who pushed
the<00:01:24.210> mob<00:01:25.009> back<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.700> trip<00:01:26.850> wire<00:01:27.060> onto<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the mob back from the trip wire onto the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
the mob back from the trip wire onto the
water<00:01:27.750> channel<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.689> works<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
water channel but this works it's of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
water channel but this works it's of
course<00:01:33.060> slower<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:34.079> normal<00:01:34.409> wiring<00:01:36.110> but<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
course slower than normal wiring but you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.179 
course slower than normal wiring but you
save<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> redstone<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.810> use

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
save a lot of redstone if you don't use

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
save a lot of redstone if you don't use
this<00:01:41.189> setup<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:43.049> left<00:01:43.310> here<00:01:44.310> mop<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:45.479> get

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
this setup so left here mop which get

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
this setup so left here mop which get
pushed<00:01:46.590> onto<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.280> tripwire<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.590> repeater

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
pushed onto the tripwire the repeater

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.480 
pushed onto the tripwire the repeater
station<00:01:50.450> with<00:01:51.450> another<00:01:51.720> mop<00:01:52.040> next<00:01:53.040> trip<00:01:53.220> wire

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.850 

and<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> side<00:01:56.969> redstone<00:01:57.659> line<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and on the side redstone line so if you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.429 
and on the side redstone line so if you
use<00:01:59.420> redstone<00:02:00.979> save<00:02:01.979> redstone<00:02:03.439> resource

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
use redstone save redstone resource

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.130 
use redstone save redstone resource
faintly<00:02:04.740> repeater<00:02:05.610> design<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
faintly repeater design here you can

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
faintly repeater design here you can
save<00:02:07.469> yourself<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.520> redstone<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.080> big

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
save yourself a lot of redstone and big

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.970 
save yourself a lot of redstone and big
projects<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.890> don't<00:02:11.160> need<00:02:11.629> speed

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
projects we don't need speed

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.720 
projects we don't need speed
but<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:13.940> lang<00:02:16.510> what's<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.690> another<00:02:18.730> well

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
but just lang what's so another well

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.899 
but just lang what's so another well
useful<00:02:20.209> feature<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:21.310> well<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.489> more<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:22.760> a

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
useful feature of well it's more like a

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.000 
useful feature of well it's more like a
bag<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.390> tripwire<00:02:24.610> infinite<00:02:25.610> lava<00:02:26.019> if<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.319> let

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
bag of tripwire infinite lava if you let

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.539 
bag of tripwire infinite lava if you let
flow<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> liquid<00:02:28.790> onto<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.110> set<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.799> tripwire

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
flow a liquid onto the set of tripwire

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.460 
flow a liquid onto the set of tripwire
it<00:02:31.879> won't<00:02:32.090> work<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.540> just<00:02:32.780> string<00:02:33.230> on<00:02:33.379> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
it won't work with just string on the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.890 
it won't work with just string on the
bottom<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:34.459> Eaton<00:02:34.760> has<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:35.030> be<00:02:35.150> working

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
bottom that Eaton has to be working

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.850 
bottom that Eaton has to be working
tripwire<00:02:36.319> them<00:02:37.840> from<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> place<00:02:39.140> where<00:02:39.440> are

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
tripwire them from the place where are

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.520 
tripwire them from the place where are
the<00:02:40.040> water<00:02:40.549> source<00:02:40.849> with<00:02:41.540> water<00:02:41.780> or<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.140> lava

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the water source with water or the lava

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.910 
the water source with water or the lava
flows<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.250> top<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.790> choir<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.989> new<00:02:45.650> source

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
flows on top of the choir a new source

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.500 
flows on top of the choir a new source
gets<00:02:46.129> created<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:49.310> example<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.819> way

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.949 

we'll<00:02:53.510> get<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.660> note<00:02:53.840> lava<00:02:54.349> sauce<00:02:54.739> here<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
we'll get a note lava sauce here and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.900 
we'll get a note lava sauce here and
since<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.079> can<00:03:00.290> make<00:03:00.980> infinite<00:03:01.280> strings<00:03:01.700> with

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
since you can make infinite strings with

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.500 
since you can make infinite strings with
spiders<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.660> get<00:03:02.810> infinite<00:03:03.230> lava<00:03:04.329> well<00:03:05.329> it's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
spiders you get infinite lava well it's
