00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 All right, the people here, who you look at 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.150
 but we are talking to you more 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 a collective tutorial dedicated to 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 here is a very good program for 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.040
 you know how to create your characters already 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.080
 I had brought a channel but I decided 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 bring it back because it's worth it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 is the program called human maker 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.769
 for you who do not know half a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 program and is best known for being one of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.490
 gift for the laender but also you can 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 work on others in a gene in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 creation of only one 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.230
 character you can create characters 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.340
 various genres 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.020
 What I find interesting is that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.120
 impresses you since you can 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 customize you can check from 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 to create a baby until you create the most 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 adult you can harass and all that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 you can use this project too 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
 without any problem without difficulty 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.940
 people are creating a character here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.739
 that she is using the creation of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.170
 unb game says you were born to you 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.879
 we also have several sets of creation 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 of games unb obviously because they are in 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 high in this genre I really like 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 games in this style survival of the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.010
 I think you 'll enjoy the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 we will customize this 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.250
 character as we want it 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.320
 as you like to think of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 use our project is always good 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.930
 here I am commanded by the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.189
 free program 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.229
 we will also give using 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.909
 tac paid programs to our channel 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 demonstrate to you also how to 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 use these tools then do not 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.400
 worry that people use programs 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.659
 free and paid also if you have a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.420
 design that you want us to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.619
 has used software that can help 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.240
 creating games you think 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 interesting but you have not seen tutorials 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 still leaves the one that this video that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.079
 indicated in the comments and that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.150
 seeking to know 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 obviously more information about this 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.170
 tool and we can check 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.180
 bring tutorials to you guys 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.579
 you personally meet in Portuguese 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 Brazilians again from gringos then 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.000
 people have this difficulty because 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.439
 You chose then if you want to see 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.210
 with the character stays a little longer in the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.070
 African style is said to be a 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 bit more chance to tyco you can 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.570
 to adjust was also the genre too 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.870
 this problem of getting a character 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.090
 very very 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.340
 I have even with the zinho option here that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.140
 it was just an adult, is it just that we 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.450
 using this option is going to be 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.460
 flÃ¡vio tube because it may not be 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 recommended for minors in then is this 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.150
 Hey guys who have your options. 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.280
 we are also the character you can 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.680
 be as you want 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
 so much wear both the bone or the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.920
 be the boni so you will move 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.830
 again any problem you 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.660
 I have game creation I mentioned here 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 below also if you use 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.100
 human resources if you do not know the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 program now or if you 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.220
 also used the program that the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.350
 character that in the comments and will 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.300
 be very important the union has another 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.880
 3d software also very cool 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.120
 the good thing is that you follow these options - 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.040
 He did not even make you adjust the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.440
 party character you ronaldo likes the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.360
 a sound and we're going to get these little ones 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.270
 changes as you can see is just 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
 it actually helps small details in the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.560
 face of the character you have as well 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.870
 customize and build as one piece 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 frostbite the limit can give you that not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.560
 know we had done pretty quick goal 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.360
 here the program we forgot to stay 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.790
 you have a few things but as 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.350
 please no character wally in 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.209
 The program we will have indicated for 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.310
 you wanted it that way until 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.410
 because we do not want is obviously 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.480
 creating something very detailed regret 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.489
 our game is very much because it has to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.440
 much also for performance in their game 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.390
 not only create something very heavy 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.890
 Obviously you realize this is 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.840
 a powerful machine and you obviously 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.430
 can create but in our case we do not 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.680
 has a powerful machine so we 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.050
 goes obviously a bit of caution in this 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.630
 What is your problem? 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.520
 character's finger options 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.230
 only he is not popular of that part 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.270
 this next one they leave you too 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.459
 adjust the width of the neck 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.110
 This is a very simple detail that 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 They make a big difference to you guys. 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.769
 developing a game really 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.880
 I recognize that the above options of 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.730
 modeling options that we are 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.620
 seeing here are other causes of clothing 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.660
 If you think clothes to your 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.430
 characters but few limited 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 also the hometown bad is that they 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.590
 have some of them see with the marquinha the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.290
 make logo the map offers software 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.360
 incredibly good free to us until 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.520
 can make your mark 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.990
 I also humbly in this matter but 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.030
 just for you you should use this 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.470
 clothes in our game them a no 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.960
 are developing and will not be a 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.180
 We will modify this animal afterwards. 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.010
 character quickly to be 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.030
 leaving it looking like a zombie more 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.799
 more forward 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.800
 here you choose if you want a gold 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.960
 nict pole low eye look like you 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.730
 chose eye it obviously can for 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.010
 do not weigh for your computer and that 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.540
 be a profession that the hair option 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.060
 is very limited, you only have these 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.710
 four of our hair we will choose 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.930
 always the latter to modify too 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.669
 program as well as some people have 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.320
 difficulty is importing 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.820
 characters can defeat let's say 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.310
 some solutions and if it happens 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.500
 some kind of bug touch profession of 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.900
 dentist using here is what I'm going to 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.080
 skip this next popular takedown because 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.669
 I really can not here, it can not be 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.160
 recommended for children under 18 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.140
 here the options obviously you are 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.510
 leaving the professional limit can or 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.940
 uol can choose this option here from 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.919
 can see which chain under the 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.780
 The character's face went very crazy 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.400
 This is great, here you are. 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.780
 play very light mind 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.979
 but we are going with this second option that 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.840
 obviously did not leave the character as 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.760
 Ugly he looks ugly in obviously but not 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.970
 leaves it as ugly as it gets in that 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.640
 last option to overcome it pole she wears 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.560
 that option on which can be 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.169
 Viewed character well from afar knows 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.460
 obviously you do not see the 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.140
 face of the character but how do we go 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.360
 create animations in all things not 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.340
 will use this option that has this 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.860
 issues to be implemented. 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.900
 Your game has several we are going 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.950
 stay here then personal 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.720
 we will continue in the next videos if 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.400
 Did you like the one that goes beyond? 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.350
 we will continue to publicize 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.240
 creating this character at the end give 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.280
 importing to the blender problem 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.760
 I hope you have Portuguese spoken. 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.760
 and I went
