00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
anything I just took it just to show you
that<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:51.870> AT&amp;T<00:00:52.500> Nokia<00:00:52.949> part<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.340> don't

because<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> does<00:02:10.259> seem<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.979> crew<00:02:11.220> april

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because it does seem kind of crew april

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400

it's<00:02:11.819> not<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.629> DAP

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's not the DAP

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.010 
it's not the DAP
of<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.590> date<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.400> too<00:02:14.580> far<00:02:14.850> off<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.540> it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
of a date it's not too far off and it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.110 
of a date it's not too far off and it
seems<00:02:16.290> reasonable<00:02:16.920> especially<00:02:17.760> since<00:02:17.910> it's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
seems reasonable especially since it's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.670 
seems reasonable especially since it's
coming<00:02:18.360> from<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:18.630> assistant<00:02:19.110> manager<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
coming from an assistant manager and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.520 
coming from an assistant manager and
that's<00:02:20.550> pretty<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.240> end<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.380> video

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
that's pretty much the end of this video

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
that's pretty much the end of this video
I<00:02:22.710> just<00:02:22.920> want<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.100> quickly<00:02:23.790> say<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
I just want to quickly say that and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.910 
I just want to quickly say that and
remember<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> been<00:02:24.900> rumored<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.650> price
