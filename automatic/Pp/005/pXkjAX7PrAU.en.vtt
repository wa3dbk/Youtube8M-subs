00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
defensive positioning it allows you to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.420 
defensive positioning it allows you to
really<00:03:15.640> get<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.940> very<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:17.470> larger<00:03:18.010> area<00:03:18.040> of

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
really get a very much larger area of

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.909 
know been very focused on trying to grab
these<00:05:21.520> triple<00:05:21.820> caps<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.470> reason<00:05:23.470> being<00:05:23.650> is

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
these triple caps and reason being is

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.150 
these triple caps and reason being is
most<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.550> these<00:05:24.610> maps<00:05:24.910> are<00:05:25.090> very<00:05:25.930> one-sided<00:05:26.229> so

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
most of these maps are very one-sided so

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.969 
most of these maps are very one-sided so
if<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.460> have<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.940> opportunity<00:05:27.970> I'd<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:29.470> nail

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
if you have the opportunity I'd to nail

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.490 
if you have the opportunity I'd to nail
that<00:05:30.220> triple<00:05:30.610> cap<00:05:30.840> definitely<00:05:31.840> go<00:05:32.020> for<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.320> all

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
that triple cap definitely go for it all

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.740 
that triple cap definitely go for it all
the<00:05:32.860> points<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.400> board<00:05:33.729> matter<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:34.660> you

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
the points on the board matter so you

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.400 
the points on the board matter so you
gotta<00:05:35.020> accumulate<00:05:35.620> as<00:05:35.740> many<00:05:35.919> as<00:05:36.130> possible<00:05:36.370> and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
gotta accumulate as many as possible and

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.270 
gotta accumulate as many as possible and
definitely<00:05:38.410> pulling<00:05:38.650> off<00:05:38.800> some<00:05:38.979> great

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
definitely pulling off some great

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.880 
definitely pulling off some great
defensive<00:05:39.790> positions<00:05:40.210> here<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.840> know<00:05:40.990> being

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
defensive positions here you know being

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.040 
defensive positions here you know being
in<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.039> pail<00:05:42.220> up<00:05:42.430> being<00:05:42.789> in<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.060> position<00:05:43.510> to

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
in a pail up being in the position to

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.279 
in a pail up being in the position to
counter<00:05:44.680> any<00:05:44.860> flight<00:05:45.250> caps<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:46.240> great<00:05:46.840> it

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
counter any flight caps is great it

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.290 
counter any flight caps is great it
allows<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:47.950> continuously<00:05:48.760> go<00:05:49.000> for<00:05:49.210> these
