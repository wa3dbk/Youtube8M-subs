00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
guess realistically it's not so much a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.229 
guess realistically it's not so much a
trick<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.579> better<00:00:50.700> keep<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> in

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
trick as it is you better keep this in

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.279 
trick as it is you better keep this in
your<00:00:51.270> mind<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:51.750> you're<00:00:51.840> fighting<00:00:52.079> these

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your mind when you're fighting these

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
your mind when you're fighting these
things<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.010> basically<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.789> come<00:00:54.000> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
things so basically when you come in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
things so basically when you come in
contact<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.870> say<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.559> mind<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.949> here

buddy now say you're trying to kill the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
buddy now say you're trying to kill the
silver<00:01:38.460> fish<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> bow<00:01:39.060> there's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> chance

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
silver fish with a bow there's a chance

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
silver fish with a bow there's a chance
when<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> critical<00:01:41.009> strike<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.490> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
when you have a critical strike which is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
when you have a critical strike which is
just<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.000> fully<00:01:42.299> drawn<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.810> bow<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.829> will

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
just a fully drawn back bow then it will

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
just a fully drawn back bow then it will
kill<00:01:44.189> him<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.030> consistent<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
kill him but it's not consistent so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
kill him but it's not consistent so
there<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> chance<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> won't<00:01:47.130> kill

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there is a chance that it won't kill

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
there is a chance that it won't kill
them<00:01:47.460> now<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.329> thing<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.810> go

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
them now the same thing is going to go

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
them now the same thing is going to go
for<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.170> splash<00:01:49.470> potions<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> harming

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
for these splash potions of harming

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
for these splash potions of harming
which<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.670> instant<00:01:51.000> damage<00:01:51.240> potions<00:01:51.630> instant

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
which are instant damage potions instant

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
which are instant damage potions instant
damage<00:01:52.560> tube<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.070> usually<00:01:53.250> kill<00:01:53.610> them<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
damage tube will usually kill them but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
damage tube will usually kill them but
there<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> chance<00:01:54.600> again<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> does<00:01:55.770> not

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there is a chance again that it does not

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.399 
there is a chance again that it does not
therefore<00:01:56.640> it'll<00:01:57.149> call<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> mate<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
therefore it'll call a mate and of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
therefore it'll call a mate and of
course<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.799> instant<00:01:59.159> damage<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.640> will<00:02:00.180> not

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
course the instant damage one will not

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.819 
course the instant damage one will not
always<00:02:00.479> kill<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.079> hit<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.680> it's
