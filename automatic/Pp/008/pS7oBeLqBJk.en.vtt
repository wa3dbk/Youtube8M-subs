however specs are not everything and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.090 
however specs are not everything and

have a smaller year Cup and they do not

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.440 
have a smaller year Cup and they do not
accelerate<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.390> much<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.350> over<00:02:26.830> here<00:02:27.220> and

accelerate as much as the over here and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.450 
accelerate as much as the over here and
that's<00:02:28.450> why<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.720> over<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.890> usually
