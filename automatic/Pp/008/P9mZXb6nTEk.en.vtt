00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.420
 Hello dear audience to another 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.460
 follow chatter lightning with me 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.900
 maximilian meinhardt chatty places 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.509
 is probably not the only one 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.910
 german word that with tz with two tz 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.830
 but it ends up also a format in the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.010
 the chess player because here before you 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.830
 see a lot on the place of jazz 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.480
 twenty four plays and tries 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 make this game as meaningful as possible 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.310
 comment and if it works too 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.730
 play a good game yourself 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.100
 can 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.720
 I go directly into the play son and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.000
 you see it here with you 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.380
 various times considered active here 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.030
 You can get a minute's rate 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.860
 Play one can pitt three minutes 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.600
 plays five minutes or even fifteen 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.190
 minutes 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 I'll see if I have an opponent 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 he 'll give me a three-minute 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.460
 wants to play a three-minute game 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.740
 and there it goes already I play 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.180
 against an italian called lorcas the 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.190
 with d 4 I start answering with e6 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.380
 its quite flexible if it knows here 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.150
 I would have wanted to play e4 in the 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.310
 French defense defense 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.820
 but it can be decided 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.380
 for c4 and now I play the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.549
 Tarrasch Defense It is one of the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.929
 I open the door halfway 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.520
 he should dominate the white seems 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.340
 here a pretty quiet construction too much 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.350
 with e 300 runner b5 chess on the b50 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.179
 Now I can think if I only 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.240
 for these games or just times 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.850
 jump c6 you already notice by my 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.679
 I'm already talking in an easy time 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.030
 detrimentally ask this time directly 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.899
 I hope that I am here 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.329
 Runners get on 10 6 he thinks 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.030
 here for a while may of course 0 43 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.009
 play back but I've 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.679
 This primove cogs a little bit 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.810
 time made now i develop mine 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.259
 runner after the sex that counts here times 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 after h2 where i do not have the white yet 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.389
 will settle someone in the near future 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.649
 with the a4 he attacks the farmers on c 6 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:04.039
 but I can do it very well 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.929
 defend and do his turn 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.999
 I did not quite understand I developed 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.399
 times in my notice security with 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.630
 the short nobility and the idea that I have 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.390
 Maybe here is that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.600
 I run from the six times to B 8 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 or c7 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.950
 my ladies after 36 manÃ¶vriere and there 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.710
 a battery on the diagonal b82 too 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.600
 generate so now I'll take it up 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.220
 the four off and we are looking now 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.730
 he takes back increases with farmers 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 okay then tower on the open e like 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.420
 never ask 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.090
 and now you can think about it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.370
 maybe we can sacrifice on h2 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.610
 is 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.020
 I'll just go out without marc 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.790
 without calculating big if the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.170
 should take canceled what was good 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.090
 then will make the four jump 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.540
 chess and somehow with the lady up 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.340
 to swing the king's wing on everyone 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.740
 case it seems an Italian 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 opponent something to have irritated 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.150
 springer the four chess reached back 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.700
 and now you helped now threatening 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.270
 very uncomfortable with it but suggests f2 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.990
 prevented with springer g3 everything 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.450
 of course I just go here 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.210
 and now I can not give up on a1 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.710
 unfortunately that's why with the hv 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.120
 somehow still roll on and this 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.780
 defense spokesman on the three 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.120
 back with her the white runner on b2 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.920
 is pretty weak around 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.420
 I now have a figure head for it 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.350
 but well, just get a farmer 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.780
 However, it is the white here well 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.060
 hard to bring kings security 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.710
 the eternal is still open 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.730
 Swaps the back one 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.390
 he probably tells coni 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.650
 but then I could import the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.540
 He also takes out there with g1 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.380
 schachclubs drifting snow 1 is leaving now 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.460
 unfortunately not yet but I call 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.420
 let's go but king has to take back 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.360
 and now I could farm on g2 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 profit doing here once more with the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 horn forward springer f1 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.060
 put most likely well matt 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.799
 I will not want those here though 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.989
 after all, mine is already up 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.370
 landed h4 and the rather clumsy 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 continued h3 h2 haremsdame could 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.020
 already sufficient 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.490
 yes why not continue with the construction 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.750
 with springer here three jumpers 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.639
 want to exchange and I'll take it 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.720
 away from here 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.960
 he has to fight back with the springer 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.479
 and now I hit g1 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.180
 maybe that was just fine 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.000
 play h2 and h1 lady or tour 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.500
 or what ever 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.090
 and he can hardly prevent that from happening 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.060
 that the runner on b2 really is from 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.810
 his own farm d4 turned 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.680
 is and can not intervene in the game 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.430
 and in fact he already has here 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.169
 abandoned an opponent like that 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.360
 sacrifice on h2 I do not have it now 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.120
 calculated big but it seems well 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.500
 to have gone and I could go with 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.760
 a nice attack actually right 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.850
 quickly this game against mine 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.110
 Italian counterparty profit 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.419
 I have a few elo points 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.990
 gained here on the place you have 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.849
 yes, a game then the strength 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.009
 change according to victory or defeat 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.660
 thank you very much for being there and 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.830
 have watched here and maybe 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.360
 we see us soon on check 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.090
 point the previously on the place on and 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.590
 will play together a lot, 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.590
 thanks for seeing and see you soon
