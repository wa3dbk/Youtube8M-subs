00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
the running stride is going to be

the running stride is going to be

which isn't designed to absorb that
impact<00:01:19.700> stress<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.020> these<00:01:21.289> exercises<00:01:21.890> should

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
impact stress so these exercises should

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.700 
impact stress so these exercises should
help<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:22.729> progress<00:01:23.539> from<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.200> resting<00:01:24.679> state

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
perhaps a very light warm-up right into

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.410 
perhaps a very light warm-up right into
more<00:01:28.939> quality<00:01:29.509> running<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:30.350> use<00:01:30.530> these

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
more quality running you can use these

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.639 
more quality running you can use these
separate<00:01:32.420> from<00:01:32.600> your<00:01:32.749> run<00:01:32.899> workouts<00:01:33.409> but

exercises you should feel that way you
should<00:04:04.900> start<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.260> feel<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.620> blood<00:04:05.800> flowing

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
should start to feel the blood flowing

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.640 
should start to feel the blood flowing
and<00:04:06.880> everything<00:04:07.420> starting<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.840> loosen<00:04:08.110> up<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and everything starting to loosen up and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.130 
and everything starting to loosen up and
become<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> little<00:04:09.250> bit<00:04:09.370> more<00:04:09.550> mobile<00:04:10.020> six<00:04:11.020> to

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
become a little bit more mobile six to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990 
become a little bit more mobile six to
eight<00:04:11.260> reps<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:11.710> one<00:04:11.890> side<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.400> then<00:04:12.700> move<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
eight reps on one side and then move to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:30.730 
eight reps on one side and then move to
the<00:04:13.240> other<00:04:13.270> side

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.529 

right<00:04:31.460> from<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:31.699> position<00:04:31.940> you<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.419> go

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
right from this position you can go

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.050 
right from this position you can go
right<00:04:32.660> into<00:04:32.840> some<00:04:33.080> hip<00:04:33.229> circles<00:04:33.789> so<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.030> a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
right into some hip circles so this is a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.760 
right into some hip circles so this is a
little<00:04:35.180> bit<00:04:35.479> more<00:04:35.630> dynamic<00:04:36.259> than<00:04:36.289> the<00:04:36.560> fire

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
little bit more dynamic than the fire

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.490 
little bit more dynamic than the fire
hydrant<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:39.020> about<00:04:39.229> everything

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
hydrant think about everything

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.110 
hydrant think about everything
