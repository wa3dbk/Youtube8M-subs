00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.100 
quite a nice looking instrument cluster
it's<00:04:57.710> done<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.610> pretty<00:04:58.760> good<00:04:58.880> job<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.780> not<00:04:59.990> as

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
it's done a pretty good job it's not as

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.750 
it's done a pretty good job it's not as
big<00:05:00.320> as<00:05:00.440> some<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.800> others<00:05:01.040> so<00:05:01.220> feels<00:05:01.550> a

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
big as some of the others so feels a

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.340 
big as some of the others so feels a
little<00:05:02.030> bit<00:05:02.270> tight<00:05:02.540> not<00:05:02.780> shocking<00:05:03.170> in<00:05:03.260> the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
little bit tight not shocking in the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.440 
little bit tight not shocking in the
back<00:05:03.500> seat<00:05:03.800> but<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.040> boot<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.880> bit<00:05:05.150> smaller

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
back seat but the boot is a bit smaller

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.270 
back seat but the boot is a bit smaller
although<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.960> has<00:05:06.110> got<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.470> removable<00:05:07.010> shelf

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
although it has got a removable shelf

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.150 
although it has got a removable shelf
which<00:05:07.460> makes<00:05:07.730> it<00:05:07.930> more<00:05:08.930> accommodating<00:05:09.170> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
which makes it more accommodating the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.950 
which makes it more accommodating the
real<00:05:10.370> standout<00:05:10.640> for<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> captor<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.690> its

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
real standout for the captor is its

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.620 
real standout for the captor is its
refinement<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.770> comfort<00:05:13.250> it<00:05:13.370> sort<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.360> glides

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
refinement and comfort it sort of glides

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.910 
refinement and comfort it sort of glides
over<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.020> bumps<00:05:15.350> better<00:05:15.560> than<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.800> other

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
over the bumps better than the other

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.760 
over the bumps better than the other
ones<00:05:16.160> it's<00:05:16.550> quieter<00:05:17.060> inside<00:05:17.320> even<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> engine

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
ones it's quieter inside even the engine

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.740 
ones it's quieter inside even the engine
is<00:05:18.920> pretty<00:05:19.130> quiet<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:19.820> there's<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.540> downside

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
is pretty quiet but there's a downside

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.410 
is pretty quiet but there's a downside
which<00:05:21.260> is<00:05:21.500> performance<00:05:22.430> there's<00:05:23.090> not<00:05:23.240> a<00:05:23.270> whole

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
which is performance there's not a whole

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.720 
which is performance there's not a whole
lot<00:05:23.570> of<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:23.840> you've<00:05:24.620> only<00:05:24.740> got<00:05:24.890> a<00:05:24.920> 1.2<00:05:25.520> liter

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
lot of it you've only got a 1.2 liter

lot of it you've only got a 1.2 liter
engine<00:05:26.150> 88<00:05:26.900> kilowatts<00:05:27.440> yes<00:05:27.710> it's<00:05:27.890> got<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.100> turbo
