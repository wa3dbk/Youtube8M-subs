and that is going to be off the charts
and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> WWE<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.230> doing<00:00:55.590> right<00:00:55.800> by

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and I think that WWE is doing right by

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.709 
and I think that WWE is doing right by
this<00:00:56.070> match<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> probably

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this match because this is probably

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
this match because this is probably
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> best<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> biggest

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
going to be one of the best and biggest

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760
