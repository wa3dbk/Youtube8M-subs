00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.650
 welcome desktop lovers 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.740
 tennis on channel dimax 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.350
 Alexey Simanovsky is with you today 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.650
 tell and show how to remove the rubber 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.960
 glue on a quart before 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.880
 demonstrate how glue is removed from 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.509
 lips I'll tell you when and why 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.939
 do when we smeared 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.470
 new pad and plastered base 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:39.829
 sticking them glued after removing the lining 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 all glue will remain on the pad that is 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.039
 there your double is so thin 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 doesn't bother anyone but if we 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.170
 rearrange the cover from the base to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 the basis we smear additional layers 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.289
 that 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.149
 the thickness of the adhesive layer on the pad 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.090
 will accumulate and when will the layers 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.370
 30 or more in total it will become 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.850
 thick enough to start distorting 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.430
 feeling and stop playing this 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.439
 case and need to remove the rubber glue 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.119
 sounds 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.280
 so that it does not prevent us from playing did not say 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.290
 feeling 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.659
 i brought one of my old linings 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.700
 which is thick enough 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.490
 glue so that it can be ok 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.110
 take off to start taking off the glue 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.950
 you must first podkovyrnut with the edge of the layer I 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.040
 to save time I did it in advance 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.940
 that's what it looks like 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.370
 preparation for removal now so here 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.560
 need from some edge this layer 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.360
 pick up 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.120
 after such preparation is done 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:03.520
 layer like this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:08.360
 fingers and stretches like a film 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.080
 need to be need to comply in this matter 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.770
 known accuracy because you can 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 tear in the process and the glue itself but this is not 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.959
 sorry we will throw it away anyway 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.620
 removes but you can also tear and sponge on 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.290
 treasure than lubok softer and and the story and the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.560
 easier to damage 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.850
 the harder it is to shoot because it's me 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.800
 I remove the glue from the Chinese lining the Chinese 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.750
 I have the most suspicion 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.570
 make their lips specially with smooth 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.590
 surface to be easy with them 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:52.489
 shoot a clip European lining in this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.440
 plan unfortunately is usually much more difficult 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.410
 there are lining of which so slay 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.320
 you canâ€™t take it off at all if your hand is very soft 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.170
 very porous it will tear when 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.180
 attempting to pick up a well layer when the hand 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.310
 not soft or at least called 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.320
 the surface looks like this 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.010
 tightening the adhesive film 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.010
 tubes 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.560
 Now the pad is clean and you can again 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.030
 and cover with glue until it accumulates 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.600
 thick layer which again will need 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.550
 take off either while on the smooth lining not 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.550
 wear it will need to throw
