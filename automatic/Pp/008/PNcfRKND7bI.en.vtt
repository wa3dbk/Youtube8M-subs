00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910 
when I'm hearing that so figured I would

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.900 
when I'm hearing that so figured I would
just<00:07:38.940> pause<00:07:39.270> and<00:07:39.570> listen<00:07:39.630> for<00:07:39.840> a<00:07:39.960> second

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:40.910 
just pause and listen for a second

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:47.440 
just pause and listen for a second
sounds<00:07:41.910> like<00:07:42.000> I<00:07:42.120> might<00:07:42.240> mess<00:07:42.479> something<00:07:42.660> up<00:07:42.840> I

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.450 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.580 

should<00:07:48.450> probably<00:07:48.539> go<00:07:48.870> and<00:07:49.080> find<00:07:49.229> out<00:07:49.410> what's

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590 
should probably go and find out what's

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.290 
should probably go and find out what's
going<00:07:49.800> on<00:07:49.889> with<00:07:49.950> the<00:07:50.099> computer<00:07:50.400> I'm<00:07:50.910> hearing<00:07:51.240> a
