 the summer gymnastics project 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.970

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.600
 years ago what is the proposal that people 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.969
 not even be a university and have a 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 period of recess 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.199
 we agree that there is no need 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 to have a total stop of activities 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.579

 our students so has interest and 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.699
 continue the activity throughout the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.170
 involves both artistic gymnastics 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.270
 We make fun of everything. 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.070
 world to get to know and know the project 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 starting in March begins more with the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 project of experiences even in the modality 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
 of artistic gymnastics 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.820
 the goal is already different because 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.740
 people leave the jokes a little 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.840
 side and already part a little more for 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.790
 knowledge of artistic gymnastics and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.680
 inside ufrgs here we have a 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 design that calls the sports nucleus of 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.820
 Sports ministry base then 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.260
 children who are talented that we 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 is observing all year round 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.940
 in the extension project classes 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 they are invited to test for 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.760
 be part of this group that a group already 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.100
 of training aimed at is competitions 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.590
 long term and we then select 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.970
 children five to eight years of age 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.159
 open all year round for us too 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.020
 make this storm in children and the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.520
 base sport core project he is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.440
 free when children are 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 selected to be part of them 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.960
 do not pay anything they get a uniform 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.850
 in all the support to be able to be of 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.229
 suddenly an athlete during the project 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.330
 You'll see how much fun it is for the 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.009
 children already in this one project without 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.539
 to know the gymnastics and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.730
 people are introducing gymnastics then 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.489
 need not have participated in other 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.040
 projects can come here only participate and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.520
 over time develops the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.890
 journey 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.660
 It's important because we have a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.910
 gym that is one of the best on the river 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.410
 great southern if not one of the best 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.740
 Brazil, we have all the equipment 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.510
 imported is an opportunity to 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.020
 children can do a project 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.490
 affordable is the cost is very calm to 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.950
 Public school child is a little 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.170
 cheaper also my scolding nor 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.140
 even stretching and good traffic is genetic and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.910
 awakening to body practice with 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.080
 What is the purpose of ceasing to be 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.120
 sedentary 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.640
 a child should not she will create 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.650
 healthy habits from a 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.590
 regular practice is to grow a being 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.050
 healthy balance 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 I think it's important to offer children 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.780
 in this type of activity 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.700
 because this makes the children 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.290
 have contact with physical exercise 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.880
 Just kidding, right? 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.160
 in the courtyard at the school where they study 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.480
 and if you think I liked the bed 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.440
 elastic bed of the year is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.480
 stamped 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.430
 but you went not only think I learned 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.070
 things and I managed to do this 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.959
 project is very influential in the life of 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.670
 any child and it is important for parents 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.080
 do mainly now on vacation 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.420
 for the children were not totally 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.430
 stops during the year during the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.660
 end physical education but in 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.020
 vacation is important too. 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.420
 continue with the sport until not 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.040
 undergo a very rapid change not all 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.150
 your body when you are also with a 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.060
 development with other children 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.060
