00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it have to be set up like that because I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
can't I can't get it the whole way over

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.930 
can't I can't get it the whole way over
to<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.350> with<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> broken<00:00:43.770> link<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
to here with the broken link so the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.180 
to here with the broken link so the
change<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.300> sloppy<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> change

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
change really sloppy now so to change

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840 
change really sloppy now so to change
that<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.690> move<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> engine<00:00:49.850> back

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that we're going to move the engine back

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
that we're going to move the engine back
because<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.840> whole<00:00:51.989> way<00:00:52.140> forward<00:00:52.649> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
because it is the whole way forward in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.549 
because it is the whole way forward in
the<00:00:53.219> mount<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:57.559> muggins

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the mount so I want to do that muggins

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
the mount so I want to do that muggins
removing<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> custom<00:00:59.840> additions<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
removing the custom additions of the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.980 
removing the custom additions of the
front<00:01:01.320> forks<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.670> easier<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> ride<00:01:05.990> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
front forks so it's easier to ride and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
front forks so it's easier to ride and
get<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.290> dirt<00:01:07.590> yuck<00:01:08.460> yuck<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> don't

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
get all this dirt yuck yuck you don't

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.750 
get all this dirt yuck yuck you don't
see<00:01:17.880> square<00:01:18.270> bolts<00:01:18.630> too<00:01:18.869> often

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.630 

okay<00:01:23.760> so<00:01:23.900> Logan<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.229> original<00:01:25.979> Forks

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
okay so Logan got the original Forks

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.260 
okay so Logan got the original Forks
back<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> spec<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:29.070> moved<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> engine<00:01:30.119> back

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
back to spec and I moved the engine back

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.469 
back to spec and I moved the engine back
but<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> wasn't<00:01:30.990> far<00:01:31.170> enough<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:32.060> permit<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
but it wasn't far enough to permit the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
but it wasn't far enough to permit the
links<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> whole<00:01:34.470> way<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.159> we're

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
links to get the whole way back so we're

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.250 
links to get the whole way back so we're
gonna<00:01:35.430> put<00:01:36.030> an<00:01:36.119> extra<00:01:36.450> link<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.140> use

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
gonna put an extra link in here and use

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.870 
gonna put an extra link in here and use
to<00:01:37.470> master<00:01:37.860> links<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.430> can't<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.670> can't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.430 
to master links because we can't I can't
get<00:01:39.000> through<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> engine<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> move<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.259> any

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440
