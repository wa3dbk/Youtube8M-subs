wounds well some patients smoke which is
a<00:01:26.150> real<00:01:26.510> big<00:01:27.020> problem<00:01:27.200> with<00:01:27.530> these<00:01:27.710> operations

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
a real big problem with these operations

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580 
a real big problem with these operations
the<00:01:28.520> incisions<00:01:28.970> are<00:01:29.090> very<00:01:29.420> long<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.020> you're

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
the incisions are very long and you're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.670 
the incisions are very long and you're
trading<00:01:30.860> big<00:01:31.280> scars<00:01:31.640> for<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.180> skin<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:33.440> skin

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
trading big scars for the skin that skin

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.830 
trading big scars for the skin that skin
on<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.490> arm<00:01:34.670> has<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.090> come<00:01:35.240> off<00:01:35.270> with<00:01:35.540> a<00:01:35.570> scar

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
on the arm has to come off with a scar

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.990 
on the arm has to come off with a scar
that's<00:01:35.990> about<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:36.680> long<00:01:36.860> as<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.220> skin<00:01:37.520> that's

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
that's about as long as the skin that's

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.570 
that's about as long as the skin that's
there<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.650> it's<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.950> trade-off<00:01:40.190> goes

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
there so it's a it's a trade-off goes

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.690 
there so it's a it's a trade-off goes
this<00:01:41.270> way<00:01:41.630> absolutely<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:42.800> way<00:01:43.070> corrected

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
this way absolutely that way corrected

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.040 
this way absolutely that way corrected
stay<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:43.940> try<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.240> hide<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.450> on<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> inside<00:01:45.020> of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
stay you try to hide it on the inside of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.320 
stay you try to hide it on the inside of
the<00:01:45.229> arm<00:01:45.410> but<00:01:45.950> they<00:01:46.250> always<00:01:46.430> seem<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.940> show<00:01:47.119> up

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
the arm but they always seem to show up

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.999 
the arm but they always seem to show up
at<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.600> most<00:01:47.750> inopportune<00:01:48.020> times<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.920> people

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
at the most inopportune times and people

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.560 
at the most inopportune times and people
are<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> little<00:01:49.670> bit<00:01:49.820> self-conscious<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
are a little bit self-conscious of the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.680 
are a little bit self-conscious of the
scars<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.110> lot<00:01:51.890> less<00:01:52.220> than<00:01:52.700> they<00:01:52.880> are<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.509> the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
scars a lot less than they are with the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.790 
scars a lot less than they are with the
skin<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.080> what<00:01:54.229> would<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.410> recommend<00:01:54.500> for

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
skin so what would you recommend for

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.490 
skin so what would you recommend for
Tanya<00:01:55.250> because<00:01:55.520> hers<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:56.030> bit<00:01:56.300> more<00:01:56.600> severe

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
Tanya because hers is a bit more severe

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.999 
Tanya because hers is a bit more severe
than<00:01:57.680> Jackie's<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:58.520> think<00:01:59.150> tanya<00:01:59.990> has<00:02:00.170> several

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
than Jackie's I think tanya has several

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.070 
than Jackie's I think tanya has several
problems<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.640> arms<00:02:01.940> are<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.330> problem<00:02:02.810> her

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
problems the arms are a problem her

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.110 
problems the arms are a problem her
abdomen<00:02:03.440> is<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.770> major<00:02:04.400> problem<00:02:04.730> because<00:02:05.090> I

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
abdomen is a major problem because I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.910 
abdomen is a major problem because I
think<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:06.170> something<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:06.560> will<00:02:06.770> get

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
think that is something that will get

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.660 
think that is something that will get
worse<00:02:07.100> over<00:02:07.310> time<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:08.470> for<00:02:09.470> for<00:02:10.280> Tanya<00:02:10.640> I

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
worse over time and for for Tanya I

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.240 
worse over time and for for Tanya I
would<00:02:10.850> say<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.090> doing<00:02:12.080> staged<00:02:12.440> operations

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
would say that doing staged operations

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.979 
would say that doing staged operations
where<00:02:13.459> we<00:02:13.580> address<00:02:14.030> each<00:02:14.209> part<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> her<00:02:14.840> body

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
where we address each part of her body

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.350 
where we address each part of her body
in<00:02:15.320> individual<00:02:15.920> surgeries<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.970> see<00:02:17.150> how<00:02:17.269> she

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
in individual surgeries to see how she

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.350 
in individual surgeries to see how she
does<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.260> great<00:02:18.620> way<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.360> I
