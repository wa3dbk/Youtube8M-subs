00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 in bar-on-dawn the champagne appears regularly in window the inhabitants 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.810
 who seems very attached I only buy hundreds of dawn and more 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.599
 especially the bar-on-dawn area 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.449
 paca 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.259
 I do not know if I am an ambassador 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.649
 in any case it is the most beautiful 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.649
 the region alsace adrien zeller the region 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.679
 and so allowed their sales and the region and heritage and especially that 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.720
 I see more and more champagne when I go to friends in Macon 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:28.460
 for example 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.560
 wanting to speak champion of dawn it's nice to say you do not have to 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.360
 not us 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.540
 unemployment 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.750
 when we eat what of course 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 ap season will be a pride also for the winemakers 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 no question for them to fail at the reputation of champagne at the shoe 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.440
 oursel isabelle tweak the smallest details and cultivates the art of good 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370
 receive as if it were 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.990
 a big awaited moment 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.230
 it's like my 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.170
 we will cure for weeks and weeks 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.560
 % and the most intense moments nothing 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.610
 we are in it since swimming soon 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.450
 a few days of the initial startup of 100 million starting blocks 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 then the champagne was a page turns he is the only candidate made without 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510
 stop altogether 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.590
 to practice the glass of champagne I think it would be a world that too 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 often are still large continents 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.799
 a moment also to display the obwald zoug marks and demonstrate the 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.189
 know-how of the wine growers of the department 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.959
 every year the charles collin cooperative develops nearly a million 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.109
 bottles under different labels she wanted to enjoy the road from 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.299
 champagne in celebration to present the range that bears his name our colleague 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.650
 which turned out he would do 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.440
 which is a good size 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.010
 allow metas to accommodate we hope more than 200 people 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.210
 just fight we'll have a tasting center 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.430
 properly speaking, it will necessarily be reduced but in all cases 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 a tasting center people who want to taste 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.010
 part of our range are welcome 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.490
 here in this building they will be provided fillon and 10% 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.780
 40% of our production 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.780
 therefore for the same party that go directly attached to give for the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.160
 great champagne houses and other parties that bears his name marco schank 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 aulas and what we want in the long term is to make more and more 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.879
 under our brand chocolate 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.679
 everyone does not know that champagne 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.129
 she had until then the coast of the whites stÃ©phane joly returned from 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.489
 abroad or the prestige of champagne 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.420
 and often the internet company and very realistic 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.230
 during his travels in his cellar and especially during the champagne route in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.850
 feast he turns himself an ambassador of the bar coast and this seems to wear 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.199
 its fruits think we've already reached this 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.199
 of this situation on on some national sectors 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.319
 in fact on belgium on them from the next europe so we still have when 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.810
 even get to create this this notoriety on the bar coast 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.059
 the appellation meters away from there while of course being fraternity with our 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.469
 colleagues of the relationship but of course the Ivory Coast intends to make the 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.939
 landscapes are shaped by the vineyards 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.999
 it is in villiers-sur-loir early kevin 50 stone independent winegrowers the 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.759
 floor to share his passion for this local story but I think 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.159
 it's something interesting to promote the gift that the region 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.819
 and our vineyard that returns all cannage the vineyards and authentic 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.119
 and we also privilege noted our welcome and our sympathy towards the 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.199
 people just passing through 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.369
 some people do not know 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.869
 in the champagne of our region so it allows to discover our 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:33.579
 prono products another region let them know story of a terroir 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.029
 beyond the sales and tasting the expected 20 thousand visitors are 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.540
 invited to discover the daily life of those who shape the champagne of the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.119
 bar coast
