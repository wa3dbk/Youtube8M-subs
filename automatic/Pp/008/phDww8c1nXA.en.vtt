 Aachen 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.300
 highest comfort outstanding reaction and switching times even less 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.709
 fuel consumption 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.699
 The new eight-speed automatic transmission can easily do more, but still open 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.989
 successful ZF predecessor models on we have the 8-speed automatic transmission 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 a bit far those of the 6 nevertheless the second generation with given 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 and that are very sporting genes characterized by very short 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.430
 Start times specifically means that the switching times below the human 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.640
 Perception screens etc 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.310
 in the kickdown with 70 kilometers per hour, the transmission needs just 400 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.380
 Milliseconds to switch from eighth to second gear 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.050
 this is just one example of more power with less consumption 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.720
 because despite all the additional benefits compared to the previous one 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.620
 Six-speed second-generation gearbox at 8-speed automatic transmission still around 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.700
 another six percent of fuel saved supplemented by the 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 start-stop function, the potential for savings is even a final spurt 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.940
 cents 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.420
 a key factor is that the engine enters at lower speeds 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.490
 can thus be less Roth fuel consumption 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.450
 the second advantage is that the transmission itself is significantly more efficient 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.590
 As a six-speed automatic transmission is the secret of this impressive 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.600
 Efficiency increases 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 when you visit the ZDF production plant in Saarbrücken 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.300
 There, the crucial items are not only manufactured but 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.970
 also put together to form an overall system 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.880
 For example, the four planets wheel sets of the creek Gang 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.080
 Automatic transmission here in a so-called wheelset drum individually 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 to be built in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.070
 SID and other components show that innovative wheelset concept per gear 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.750
 always only two switches Elementa open thereby minimize 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 Traps losses Fuel is saved 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.939
 Meanwhile, in Saarbrücken the wheelset tower is already for installation 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.060
 Marriage with the housing bell follows as the next step 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.430
 Transmission now for increased performance at less 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.369
 Lack of fuel is my brain 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.699
 or in other words a control specifically in this case the mechatronics 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:26.389
 Child she simply takes the driver off the switch by going for 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.369
 he decides when which gear to choose and she will with great 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.359
 Precision and a lot of instinct in Saarbrucken made 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.559
 and then integrated a few meters further into the transmission 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.739
 with the 8-speed automatic gearbox another innovative product is in operation 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.189
 Saarbrücken from the band that in vehicles of the compact class up to 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.989
 Luxury class is used 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.389
 will bring food more efficiency more variability and more performance that 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.319
 new 8-speed automatic transmission
