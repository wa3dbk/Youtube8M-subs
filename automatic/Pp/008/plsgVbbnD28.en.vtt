00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.610
 it was an emotion 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:28.680
 and what 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:31.680
 there's no more but they can march and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.680
 tempting 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 I hope 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 examples 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.430
 that's how you see me in the skirt 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.430
 blue 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.149
 to you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.690
 He said 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.740
 and maybe we told the story that occupies 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 the thirst of my being 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.320
 maybe shipwrecked among rain puddles 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 I txapote and I flew so high that I know that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.360
 to grow it is not enough to believe I found 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.340
 this world of skin and paper so far from 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 today like yesterday I shook my carpet of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 ovÃ­n dreams contemplating my great 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 elixir will emit this story that does not 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
 has an end in the form of sonata with piano 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 violin kidnaps the most beautiful notes 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.840
 for you polyglot universal language 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.140
 informal I decided that no matter the language 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.450
 if you know how to feel 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
 in my world there are no words left for 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.200
 describe the threat that the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 poor hope that is made to the house 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.030
 from the sad lament today I stay here 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.240
 between times eighth notes and very 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.510
 symphonies that had lived in wind 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.480
 I break my voice 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.150
 awaken command the rays to be 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.280
 rushed gardenias and birds jumped 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.860
 geraniums and several humans lay in 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.710
 stolen bodies awakened repeated the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.750
 shadows march is time to change the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.660
 broom strives more does not fit anymore 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.840
 We are under the carpet war 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.240
 You came to change not watch him die not 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.390
 I do it for me I said to the stranger and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.850
 happy literate sincere and sensible sounded and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.520
 today with its lines to call the end together 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.160
 to which the pepper pizzicato colors this 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.410
 gray and sad world was to see you lose yourself and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.180
 after not being able to know you so much 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.490
 time hidden in my mind where 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.960
 you were small avoiding snakes not 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.670
 I know what I feel 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.550
 I've seen early ages drown in 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.010
 cement avoid suffering learn to 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
 being young is not long and you're looking 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.180
 the truth 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.980
 you run the risk of being next to her 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.170
 hoping to arrive as it is going to arrive 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.690
 the brightness of the star a brief 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.880
 chemical adventure describes life more 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.130
 beautiful 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.600
 but it's not the hero is the puzzle assembled 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 that leaves simple fingerprints 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.459
 Y 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.260

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.260
 i 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.260
 to love 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
