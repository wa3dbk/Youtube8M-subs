00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820

 it will automatically go online 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.000
 I think it puts it tomorrow or Thursday in all 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 case you'll see it so that's so 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 of you has been loaded the menu you 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 would have posted like that they favor it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.280
 will have to winrar to decompress 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.960
 sorry I have a little bug here it is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.520
 so you open it and there are all the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.810
 files so has all the files there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 you are going to slide directly from 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.430
 your usb stick so I'm going to send 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.380
 to primates and usb that's it of you 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.900
 the effect you can remove your key 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 usb and we find ourselves immediately on 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.909
 the ps3 has immediately but greets all 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.049
 the world when are you here so here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.270
 we find ourselves on the ps3 so soon 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.390
 that you will have done the manipulation on 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.829
 the pc you go unplug your key 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.200
 usb from your computer and you call 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.899
 put it on you'll pardon on the m 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 the right usb port of your oil have 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.759
 well the right usb port is a slim 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.500
 a pat anything so if you 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.150
 have multiple ports this is the port the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.480
 more right 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.890
 the closest to the cd player on 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.660
 come in and I blu ray etc 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.340
 so here is in the right port and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.590
 after that you will need an infection 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 cfg so less for me I come 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.880
 to have one there so the infections 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.490
 cfj all the people who make lobbies I 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.620
 think will know it's on a 12 2 in 1 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.170
 for 14 otherwise I can make you 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.060
 also but here I am lighthouse this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.770
 is not time consuming so but but I 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.150
 can you still do it so my 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 black bread a discussions anyway 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.140
 so as soon as you have this affection 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.450
 cfg you proved your usb key you 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 go go in and kroos younger you have 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.150
 the choice creates a new profile either in 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.910
 charge and so have I seen that I have already 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.530
 I'm going loads and so see you 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.570
 call it no matter how it's not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.730
 importance after there when you arrive 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.100
 here you have configured party object 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.740
 special all the roofs hit mettewie and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.330
