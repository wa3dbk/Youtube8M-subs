 talk is what we are going to do 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 today is very beautiful 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 Well, today we bring you a new 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.980
 idea that of yÃ¡sica so we are 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.230
 with sprinkled with look is already done house 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 welcome is a new alternative for 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 the traditional manicure so that you 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 like to have the nails adorned but 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 also so you do not have time this is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.010
 a new system that is for one night 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 party for a wedding for the day of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.719
 antro then with these colorful designs 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.210
 metallic and encounters a little bit of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.969
 this new system 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 well, they are good days, this is good 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.870
 an ace multi kers are decals that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720
 come say the enamel in the form of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.120
 decal this applies 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.620
 in an easy way if what we have 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.480
 what to do first is to do a manicure 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.940
 previous preference and in the case of 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.780
 that we do not have time to do the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.300
 manicure 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 what we are going to do is push the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.430
 cuticle without cleaning always the area of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 the nail that is recommended is always 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 good to put a little oil or cream 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.750
 or if you can have wet your hands in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 water even if it's nothing else so that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.210
 be so drastic and so hard no no no no 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.990
 hurts then once we do that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.829
 we started 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.340
 draw and remove the cuticle and make them 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.960
 a comment I bring because I bring 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.549
 an acrylic layer a light layer of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.189
 critical and I thought that the best is not 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.020
 could perform here semi slow but if 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.789
 you can look here are my others 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.189
 ends is not the best as recommended 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.729
 but yes you can really clear whether 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.970
 can in fact as a product is nothing 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 more as occasion does not matter the best 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.649
 if three dreams of acrylic or you do not want 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 get acrylic or you like nails 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.690
 decorated this is an alternative you 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.180
 takes a couple of minutes to apply it and 7 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.410
 go in the dream in your town you know 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.420
 I think I love that women 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.519
 we are also age as of contentillo 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.690
 you are that you wake up is today I have left 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.330
 more different and I want to have nails 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.459
 red today I want to do something different 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.549
 the fact of and well you do not have to go 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.720
 to the beauty salon to do the manicure 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.410
 enamel then wait for it to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.810
 dry 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.970
 It really is a can instead this that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.790
 be a sticker is a wonderful option 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.430
 because of flying these lists 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.709
 4 time as an application in the classroom 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.659
 and how much would be taken in your house is counted 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.280
 obviously when you apply it you can 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.859
 be a little more time around 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.439
 about 10 minutes more or less than 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.079
 would apply if you apply it in the in the 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.359
 lounge ok not if you do this in your 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.939
 you have to itemize obviously 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:06.129
 and sometimes spectrum is less this is more 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.840
 problematic because you have to put 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.599
 prints in whatever they always touch 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.700
 like air bubbles the ctv a 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.159
 little bit when it 's like a little curved 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.980
 how they do it in the nails so that it is 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.799
 completely smooth what we use is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.810
 a dryer at home we inhabit 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.879
 we are going to use these gloves that are going to 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.639
 give warmth and they will help us to soften 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.739
 the plastic of the stickers to avoid 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.290
 that we have bubbles and so that 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.519
 obviously fit much better to the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.069
 nail in this case what we are 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.870
 working on acrylic if we have to 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.939
 make a little pores and good to the nail 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.680
 remove brightness so that it can be said 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.719
 perfectly do not get up 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.819
 it is necessary to put some coating 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.709
 over the decal 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.230
 the presentation these lists do not in fact 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.090
 nothing else so they are already to protect 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 sandra and with the same lime is this 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.510
 port is the excess if we do not need no 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.340
 we need to use scissors in my case 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.239
 good use a little bit because your vineyard is 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.609
 the review is bigger ok but 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.189
 I bring a short one through the snow but the 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.719
 scratched exactly and in for example in this 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.790
 template come writing coming 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.829
 24 or you have some spare in 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.349
 If you 66 you is better for you 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.079
 position wrong or that you dropped some 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.199
 what care must be taken during the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.910
 day we bring the stickers and 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.099
 obviously obviously you have to have 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.039
 nothing more care with is not if you feel 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:34.340
 some magazine or some was pulling 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:37.039
 to keep you from getting up 7 ok but 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 there's really no more careful 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.720
 is also can be applied in the 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.720
 Toenails 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:57.080
 to the earth that squeezes me a little 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:06.200
 shoe but for you to see that 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:08.060
 this is necessary to put the sticker on the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.520
 foot it should be mentioned that with a template 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.040
 you can do the application on the nails 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.470
 of this size long and also for the 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.150
 feet now that the feet we use and 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.130
 obviously what we have left over 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.860
 because what's left of a girl of the 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.570
 This is how we have all in house 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.690
 they are very pending because the next 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.220
 May 10 by courtesy of scans 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.660
 let's go back to give 5 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.970
 applications then they are very 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.440
 pending the same as we are going to reveal 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.100
 the dynamics so that you can win 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.100
 these applications 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.390
 the application of this how much is good is 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.350
 which varies in reality because if you 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.120
 you apply in your home, after which 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.210
 the purchase of the template and obviously 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.430
 if everything in the lounge depends on the type of 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.200
 you're lounge ok of the three accounts a 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.060
 little bit more about what color it is or what it is 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.310
 we have available each person he or 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.210
 are there that are decorated there are smooth 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.940
 it is where it is 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.430
 we also have designs in this case 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.830
 well I'm fine in an 'animal print' 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.950
 mostly and there also blue 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.840
 silver-red and gold color for 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.000
 people who do not like them now 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.460
 one thing is necessary to take away a 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.230
 sticker to put on another one or you can not 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.080
 one above the other yes yes we 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.240
 to get ready without you taking it away with 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.310
 hot water we remove the revenues in 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.650
 hot water and alone goes away 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.270
 obviously detaching is a water 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.980
 hotter than what has always been 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.200
 accustomed that warns so that the 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.870
 glue because it is very strong the 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.540
 glue after having been and not 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.480
 hurt and obviously the glue does not 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.040
 it hurts 21 I do not soil it excellent because that 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.020
 is a new alternative for when 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.480
 have time to invite a 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.480
 fast wedding you're really approaching 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.670
 stickers be very 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.420
 do not wait for it to dry that I 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.000
 it looks like a hand of you will be and piece of no 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:01.300
 I can do nothing but I know this is a 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.940
 wonder is ready to be flown in 20 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.720
 minutes 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.890
 it's amazing sock the super shoe 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:20.230
 tight but is not unbelievably 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:21.880
 has tightened the word so much is a 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.710
 good alternative nor with the shoe 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.030
 tight or with the seal already brought tennis 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.100
 because we say the application of these 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:31.710
 yesterday trier tennis a double sock of and 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.710
 not the truth is that it's not only 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.730
 obviously, usually when 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.980
 we apply something hard on the feet 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.990
 more because we have thus covered the 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.210
 two does not have any wear with the 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.460
 hands thank you very much for bringing us 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.080
 once again a great idea for you 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.790
 that are like the most innovative nail 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.180
 draw from the application is that 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.180
 expression 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:57.169
 thank you very much aunts and friends and 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.879
 They know that they have to be up to date

 May for investigations that 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:02.499
 let's paste 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.499
 if they want to participate 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.210
 and we leave thanks from the other side
