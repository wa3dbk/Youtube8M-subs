 nor the limburg confrontation between roda jc and vvv 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.160
 roda has recovered considerably from the bad start after the new year 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 secretly the team from Kerkrade is still hoping for ropers of football but how famous 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.040
 miracle happen at roda and vvv is coincidental or not she is the departure of 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.829
 keisuke honda ended up in a free fall 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.289
 just after the day of the final vvv before the winter break 20 points after the departure of 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.759
 honda the counter is at a meager number of 9 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.619
 VVV has now dropped to fourteenth place with very fast points 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.619
 necessary because to end up in the after competition 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.100
 Jan Paul Saeijs is back in the base at roda the right back was missing 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.340
 weekend voice from acker allowed kris de wree at that place 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.450
 the callers now again went next to the trainer on the reserve bench 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.710
 then vvd there captain beefheart returns under the bar of the belgian keeper 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.740
 was the last three duels absent first by suspension and then by one 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.600
 knee injury and the return of beers were so fellow countryman on the tawny owl 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 in Weert second keeper 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.560
 the competition lives in Limburg almost 17,000 spectators in the park city 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
 limburg stadium the comment is of a loose 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 probably have granted boy mans 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.050
 just gave birth 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.520
 way is the marcel de jong 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.180
 left back 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.100
 amber oil in the sea 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.560
 discussed how 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 completely free willem jansen huge opportunities willem jansen with 2 0 for 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.030
 by this victory 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.510
 what an early hit 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.480
 for the Harm van Veldhoven team 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.300
 what is defended badly 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.250
 it is not offside 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.800
 definitely not well seen 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.160
 the arbitration court 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.660
 and that will make it easier to finish the outside of an oil order 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.010
 in the sea 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.850
 atmospheric park city limburg stadium in Kerkrade it is pretty full that is 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.060
 not always the case, it also has to do with the opponent 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.410
 That 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.420
 van den burg 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.060
 This ball loss at VVV Venlo Sittard goals for Roda 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.200
 the loor cities served 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 a chance 6 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.419
 Willem Jansen 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:19.150
 give jans a good cross 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 the rescue on the use of textbooks is good from this man 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.049
 what creates roda toll easy opportunities with good actions from the wings 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 and then the spiers are dangerous the two danes 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.739
 can not reach 2 0 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.389
 goal by Jan Paul Saeijs 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 He will be sailing with roda jc on Saturday 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.199
 he did the 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.999
 charge this car 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.139
 Jan Paul Saeijs 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.559
 especially for the goalkeeper 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.950
 poorly timed by two tough live this tour and then the ball falls 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.899
 also in the purpose of VVV 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.899
 and it is already 2 0 ahead of this victory 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.329
 chess 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 for me 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 the more gourmet can go through 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.999
 a moderate match is against 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:16.379
 what a match this is the left back the more 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.700
 with a goal and the first good attack by VVV in the first out for the 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.429
 Jan van Dijk's team 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.879
 he would have a very nice first half 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.199
 vvv back in the game bouman sets up the attack himself 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.149
 it is already running with great strides 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.499
 and he is more at the ball than title 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.669
 this makes the beautiful finish 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.819
 I notice the more 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.819
 his first in the competition for VVV 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.989
 in addition 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.319
 and often 9 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.379
 marcel de jong on the left side of the site opposite the end of the deep valley 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.949
 taking the time for the cross and the other 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.399
 through timisela hurt my own goal 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.399
 good rescue from kevin d black 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.669
 chess 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.409
 between two men 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.900
 the leg of the young and also of bodor and a free kick for VVV 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.779
 the free kick 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.219
 there is contador bastiaannet is 2 2 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.819
 what a crazy first half hour 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.819
 in Kerkrade treatment option Jan van Dijk 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.889
 Newspaper VVV is on the same level 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.870
 the accompanying fans are overjoyed 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.930
 no one had counted on the miserable cia to resolve that it is too late and that 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.389
 the title is virtually hopeless open the bet 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.389
 not too bad the shadow peak of VVV 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.710
 tourist Office 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710

 calabro 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.479
 chess chess the race and then from the rebound is always recorded 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.900
 boy young young it's not his match 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.610
 he suffered a lot of ball loss 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.150
 but this one just shouldn't have shot what a huge chance for VVV 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.129
 fall of calm falling 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.129

 TV season 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:55.889
 but what is there then an earlier prognosis from the back in the back at VVV Pauwels 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.210
 has a tap there 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.210
 then there is nothing cookbook that I was actually granted 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.319
 and then i can do it and finish it on 3 2 in the joy at jan harm

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.020
 they come out more often 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.449
 chess puts back on all of us that chirac on the bar 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.449
 an excellently played attack by VVV 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.360
 only have to finish contador basia 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.529
 but hits the bar 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.529
 moreover top 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:38.539
 handy ball 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.929
 was that of jansen ensco book with a lot of space shot on target 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.949
 it well finished 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.669
 had made it faultlessly 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.719
 none of the kyoto treaties at all times 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.979
 in the far corner 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.639
 we had here with the place or balcony 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.960
 earlier this week they buy something hotel 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.240
 but that even makes it very well done 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.949
 and roda tim gruijthuisen work 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:04.439
 4 2 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.919
 vvv that maybe no longer paid 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.919
 it was a sloppy defender in Kerkrade 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.190
 because the tension increases towards the end of the competition of both 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.469
 toppers should miss 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.360
 that is then I am still doing this in fourth grade our research 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.770
 with a superstorm always good don't take the scooter from a merger between these 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.080
 we now have four points 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.840
 the nma it feels you see that may be seen my it's not just not like 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.840
 Being a member is still the constant in our game 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:39.969
 in that means that that will be back on every league and then and then 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.860
 we can also win those matches and then we can still be the actress 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.800
 make it difficult 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.870
 one condition involves roda state 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.289
 curious everyone would like to become a ninth and that place is still there
