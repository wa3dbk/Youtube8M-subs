00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello today we will cook 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.589
 unbaked fruit milk cake 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.730
 for this we need 400 grams 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.139
 tea biscuits 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 action 250 grams and a cracker I took here 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.869
 so that's gusto but you can take it any 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.350
 there is either white or brown but better 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 take and mixed so it will be even tastier 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.429
 two packs of sour cream 1 pack of such 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.830
 lemon jelly could be yourself 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.750
 do but i took already ready so not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.329
 will be simpler 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.360
 a pack of butter 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 one hundred grams for whip I cream cream with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 sour cream 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.730
 but how do we do it now 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.200
 demonstrate with my little 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.629
 assistant first thing we need to do 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.840
 here is a cookie we need very very 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.129
 You can grind it up with your hands 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.020
 You can just take a meat grinder 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 bottle and bottle just stretch them but 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.899
 You can just take a wooden rocking chair and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.899
 rocking chair size 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.650
 Well, somehow I painted cookies 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.800
 melt the butter in it and add 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.630
 here in the cookie after we 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.150
 melted our butter we 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.370
 we drive it in here 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.740
 gingerbread gently need to mix everything 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.740
 until homogeneous mixture 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 the mixture is such a little bit 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.920
 dryish but it's okay we 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:49.600
 take the mold from me mold 26 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.580
 centimeters in diameter participate 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.460
 laid out parchment for baking and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.810
 pour out all the mold here it will be 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.210
 our foundation of our cake 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 next we need this all neatly 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.890
 evenly smoothed in shape and here 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.010
 so with a spoon everything is flattened to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.380
 get a uniform layer here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.050
 look here somehow it should 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.630
 get a more or less even layer and 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.750
 Now we need this billet 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.790
 send for thirty to forty minutes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.580
 in the fridge so that our oils are a little bit 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.610
 priscilla while our cake is the one that form 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.270
 stiffens the fridge we need to whip 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.959
 sour cream 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.000
 make the second layer look in a pack 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 I add sour cream well, that's only here 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.739
 sugar is half a cup a little bit more 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.150
 than half a glass why not as full as 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.280
 because on the belt the glass will be 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.640
 very very elephants very very sweet 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.370
 no need 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.590
 and look sour cream we need to whisk not 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.390
 so that it becomes completely cream a 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.130
 so that once it became sugar and it became 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.800
 a little bit a little bit so airy 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.600
 further this one 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.990
 the mixture that we got sour cream bat 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.640
 we made sugar like this 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.010
 what I showed you at the beginning 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.650
 but we did not dilute and and since by 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.600
 recipe need we diluted it only 100 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.489
 gram of water 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.420
 because we have here 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.980
 fluids will be very much we are all 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.980
 add here completely 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.300
 further this is all you need to mix 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.519
 nice and neat that everything turned out 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.739
 plain and our gelatin here that you feel sorry 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.760
 sold all over sour cream 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.550
 in the same mixture we add these here 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.540
 cookies with the brand that I first 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.540
 video will show you 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.880
 It turned out such a small mixture 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 with sour cream regret the flow and then 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.890
 we pour this whole mixture onto our cake 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.810
 the one that is already frozen and now this 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.440
 mold we also ship to 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.290
 refrigerator until our full hardening 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.350
 second layer with gelatin our second 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.390
 the piece is already frozen to decorate the cake 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.090
 we will use frozen 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.270
 strawberries like this we have a little bit 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.050
 strawberries after winter it's still 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.590
 last year's strawberry juice we are from here 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 taken and made from it with jelly gelatin 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.860
 well how to do jelly and gelatin I do not 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.870
 I will tell 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:48.260
 but the strawberry itself we are here on 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.260
 grater 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.630
 and then everything else we fill our 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.870
 here is such a housing already cooled down somewhere 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.650
 it is already at room temperature 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.650
 neatly neat 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.760
 Well, that's all it remains to wait 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.910
 until our glands harden and 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.710
 cake we can say ours is ready for now 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.870
