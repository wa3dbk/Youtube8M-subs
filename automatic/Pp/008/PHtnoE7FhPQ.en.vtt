00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 it's a cake 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.450
 It's a shit, no asshole, and this is not 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.320
 exists in defense mode 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.780
 is the nintendo ds that's the way you thought 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.050
 that nintendo could not screw it up anymore 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.939
 the sale the nintendo 2 of that we do not leave 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.880
 the nonsense for the side okay that was 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.860
 A small introduction in this video 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.770
 I will explain the reason for the nintendo 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.439
 ds to the naked eye can be crap 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.660
 I know, I know, they do not have to tell me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 ok but let's use the head I do not know if 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.370
 some know but the nintendo 3ds of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 moment is the most sold console of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 nintendo could I suppose that is the one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.270
 keeps the company nintendo afloat 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 well because many are saying hey 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.570
 that the web is crap that water and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 you this that the water is another 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.980
 then we all know that the water of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.090
 moment is not having good sales 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 well this nintendo 3ds at first not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.399
 I was painting for a lot of good good that the 3d 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 innovative to many leaves us 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.439
 open-mouthed but not at the time of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.140
 meet and console titles 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.689
 launching was very poor seemed 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 a total loss well and more with your 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.650
 high price as many know the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.860
 nintendo 3 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.820
 if it was bundled with an exorbitant price here 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.830
 in mexico 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.530
 He came out in 5000 around 999 pesos 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.990
 450 dollars more or less well imagine 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 that price plus a poor catalog more 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.690
 implementing a new technology that 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.790
 it was not very well tested then yes 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.710
 a bad combination so it's like that is a 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.690
 very high price then nintendo 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.160
 he reflected he realized that the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.940
 console had a very high price 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.010
 started to take out good games games 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.869
 remakes then the most important thing came down from 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.770
 price of the console so is the lowered of 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.660
 price 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.330
 that's where nintendo hit the nail on the head 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.270
 very well mixes a good console more 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.740
 innovation good games price 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.410
 accessible equal and success nintendo was given 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.140
 mind that your nintendo 3ds laptop 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.000
 He had so much potential therefore decided 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.430
 focus on her draw variety of 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.270
 remake games and therefore a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.570
 nintendo 3ds 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.970
 So it's for a more adult audience than 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.730
 he wants a bigger screen like this is 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.520
 bigger and it works well for everyone to 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.890
 We all liked it, we liked it a lot 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.350
 now comes the interesting thing comes the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.300
 why of the nintendo ds I do not know if 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.030
 some friends subscribers some of 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.150
 you have had a nintendo ds a 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.280
 ds lite some of its variations 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.010
 remember that integrated hinge is if it is 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.500
 that shit that fuck the moment of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.990
 open and close the bs towards the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.390
 screen could grab some 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.670
 very strange colors that shit no longer 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.800
 lit it made many 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.900
 will be angry with nintendo for making a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 console with this kind of flaws so 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.980
 simple but at the same time they send you to the 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 shit like that is because if the hinge is on you 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.270
 jod ya brother you were going to fuck you 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.520
 nintendo ds 3ds or ds lite is dead 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.160
 and many will say yes but to nintendo 3ds 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.560
 it has the same hinge if it's okay 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.870
 let's accept it but this time a little better 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.880
 they did not reinforce it that if some of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.920
 you have a nintendo 3ds you can 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.110
 see that the hinge is no longer detached 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.530
 as easy as the previous versions 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.920
 of the nintendo ds but you can still 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.930
 get to break off here I go with this 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.540
 many will be asking for reserve leave 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.940
 to say the same shit we already know 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.280
 but good here is the interesting thing a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.680
 a good part of the nintenderos are children 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.680
 small that's the other consoles 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.540
 also from sony from microsoft are also 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.370
 small children but from nintendo a little 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.610
 rather because they are titles a bit more 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.220
 friendly children do not know shit 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.980
 they do not know how to take care of a console 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.310
 children do not take care of their consoles throw them 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.739
 down the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.550
 they hit them with what they have spilled 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.850
 water now with this nintendo 2 of that yes 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.549
 yes I know I know its design is a total 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.490
 shit but that damn nintendo 2 of 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.370
 the one that looks like a cake looks like 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.110
 hold a nuclear bomb is not going to be the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.270
 typical console that you play the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.300
 first good is what I think you see 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.970
 that the design is made to hold 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.650
 chingas good if so I think 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.380
 the console is dedicated for an audience 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.810
 more childish for a smaller audience 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.570
 you need a durable console that does not 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.090
 is screwed by the hinge that when opened it does not 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.970
 go to hell and there the why of 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.700
 the nintendo 2 of that one about ones and another 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.910
 plus it could be that you no longer have that 3d 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.250
 that's right I say plus because of this 3d 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.350
 epileptic of death they say that 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.419
 it damages the retina of the eyes that say that 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.639
 leaves the children blind and makes you have 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.090
 convulsions as well as the polygon of 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.130
 Pokemon 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.050
 that's how many seizures are said 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.240
 how much that now the mothers of these 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.520
 children will be quiet while they 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.620
 they play without fear that those children die 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.080
 this also benefits people 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.360
 that do not enjoy a good view well of 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.490
 people who wear glasses that can not 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.949
 make use of this system 3 of it that 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.530
 you need to have good vision in everything 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:32.080
 case or not use lenses to be able 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.449
 visualize well that 3d like many already 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.940
 you know it's quite uncomfortable to be able to capture 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.860
 the 3d of the console you have to put the 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.990
 some distance at a certain angle to 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.880
 can understand it well then for 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.070
 many personally I do not like it 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.710
 that damn 3d death I deactivated him 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.960
 and I say to pay for something that you 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.850
 you will not use well if I know that 3d does not 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.610
 I like what the fuck I want the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.130
 console there is what the hell I'm going to 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.410
 pay more comes over the nintendo 2's 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.350
 that will go cheaper 130 dollars 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.930
 well it's 130 dollars a little cheaper no 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.479
 I know if they go down 140 50 dollars but it's a 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.449
 very good variation well conclusion the 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.370
 design is crap but it's a good 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.270
 played by nintendo going down the 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.940
 ounce price 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.590
 and opening doors to new 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.840
 possibilities a new type of field of 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.670
 children new children who can use the 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.830
 console and throw it to the fuck how many 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.440
 children how many of us have not seen 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.110
 children in strollers children of 5 years with 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.850
 nintendo 2 of that it looks like you're 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.230
 nintendo ds went to war with 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.090
 scratches with cracked with a piece 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.190
 broke and they lack a button then 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.800
 is nintendo 3ds is like the version 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.320
 bunker of the others we do not expect that 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.330
 nintendo do the same with the wii or that 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.090
 the lower price that pull out a version 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.770
 more light and that is more accessible to 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.630
 all and start with the games 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.590
 new good so that we can 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.480
 buy it as well as happened with the 3ds good 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.130
 guys friends and subscribers the video

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.350
 different proposal from me
