00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.629
 very good everything is all the gamer and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.160
 welcome to the second race of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.350
 hummingbirds that has occurred to me here in 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
 the moon we will try to enter from the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 chalk temple through the caverns and out 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.990
 by the spiral staircase is very 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.820
 complicated in truth and not good 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.350
 You can say it's not that complicated 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.600
 but the fact is that if he is not the son of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.640
 hummingbird or we lose it we can not do it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 reappear and whoever is the one who falls or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 miss the hummingbird is lost or is no longer 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 it's not a competition it's really 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.109
 just hold until the end in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.109
 end let's go there 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.260
 we are competing with the loving 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.260
 fantastic 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.150
 angel hachÃ© xx angel h god of mine who does not 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 hit me and nothing else to start you have to 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.070
 I take care I mean I expected 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 a joint penalty 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.060
 I'm a fantastic, by the way, he was 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.890
 in the first race of hummingbirds maybe 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.080
 is it really this is handsome I think that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.670
 it's a good challenge and something innovative and 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.969
 something fun that has occurred to me 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.980
 I think it's okay for you 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.229
 do it also not only to see or 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 my god I had forgotten are the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.009
 gentlemen at the moment everything comes from 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.080
 moment everything is going well I'm going to head 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.240
 although I'm going to give them a little bit of advantage or 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 be from my point of view I think that they 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.000
 it's going to cost more to bear the hummingbird than 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.830
 and get to the end 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.590
 I'm not much interested in competing with 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.600
 them and so we go we see how lisbon or not 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.800
 it seems to me that everything is worth in this exchange the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.940
 I had lost the hummingbird because I eat 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.940
 You see he's throwing flames 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.450
 now you have to go through this area 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.799
 close or my god is that I truly believe 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 that I have come up with a good look 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.630
 what to do I think that I do not know if I 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.220
 is still liking because I have not 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.070
 I uploaded the video but I think you'll like it 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.030
 the end let's continue oh my god we have 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 lost angel 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.330
 a minute of silence for angel not the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.670
 truth is that I'm not going to shut up girlfriend 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.430
 to comment a hummingbird is also 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.729
 throwing flames let's concentrate 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.770
 pipe of this is starting to get 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.150
 Now let's go for good now 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.460
 we are in the circle of bones we are going to 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.009
 surround it until leaving by the entrance of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 upstairs I should not have gone for 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.630
 where it has gone up or I think good for 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.319
 here is a goodbye these gentlemen are going 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.050
 to foguear how we write these 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.090
 last turns that stuck and I'm a 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.130
 poquillo or this is the last part already 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.630

 around here 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.130
 let's get to the end we are very 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.430
 near 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.950
 we have not lost the end let's go how 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.270
 just the fantastic has been a good 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.840
 attempt we have already reached the 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.430
 final and it is what there is loving has been the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.990
 winner and grottos and a good race and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 a good competition I think it's something 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.610
 what are you going to like 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.310
 and I think I can do it more has come to 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.130
 invent careers like that if you like it that way 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.840
 that in the end I think it's fine we're going to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.580
 get to the end of the circuit or this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.830
 circuit had already thought about it before 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.330
 to do the race with them and I think that 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.610
 it's a very good circuit and if you want 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.960
 do it then in free throws to do it 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.090
 and have fun running a race 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.770
 with friends or doing it is just a good 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.020
 challenge to do so are the incidents 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.760
