next we will show you how to tempt food
starting<00:02:05.149> with<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> deli<00:02:05.509> as<00:02:05.750> an<00:02:05.869> example

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
starting with the deli as an example

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.279 
starting with the deli as an example
first<00:02:07.220> you'll<00:02:07.670> need<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.909> fill<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.270> cup<00:02:08.569> with<00:02:09.050> ice

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
first you'll need to fill a cup with ice

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.440 
first you'll need to fill a cup with ice
and<00:02:09.590> water<00:02:09.860> check<00:02:10.850> me<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.090> make<00:02:11.239> sure<00:02:11.270> this

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
and water check me to make sure this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.540 
and water check me to make sure this
phenomena<00:02:11.930> reached<00:02:12.110> 32<00:02:12.380> degrees<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.400> ice

phenomena reached 32 degrees in the ice
water<00:02:13.850> bath<00:02:14.830> then<00:02:15.830> you'll<00:02:16.040> need<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> stab<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
water bath then you'll need to stab the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.059 
water bath then you'll need to stab the
thermometer<00:02:17.540> through<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> food<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.470> string
