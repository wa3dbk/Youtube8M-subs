hi tile of the Rocky Mountain audio fest

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.760 
hi tile of the Rocky Mountain audio fest
2012<00:00:07.300> and<00:00:07.809> we're<00:00:08.170> here<00:00:08.620> with<00:00:09.340> Joe<00:00:10.330> skibinski

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
2012 and we're here with Joe skibinski

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.009 
2012 and we're here with Joe skibinski
and<00:00:11.770> the<00:00:11.950> abyss<00:00:12.550> headphone<00:00:13.300> this<00:00:13.870> is<00:00:13.990> a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
and the abyss headphone this is a

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.480 
and the abyss headphone this is a
prototype<00:00:14.290> and<00:00:14.769> he's<00:00:14.920> going<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.130> tell<00:00:15.309> us<00:00:15.370> a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
prototype and he's going to tell us a

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.040 
prototype and he's going to tell us a
little<00:00:15.580> bit<00:00:15.730> about<00:00:15.970> it<00:00:16.180> it's<00:00:16.269> quite<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.840> unique

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
little bit about it it's quite a unique

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.919 
little bit about it it's quite a unique
headphone<00:00:17.590> hi<00:00:18.010> Joe<00:00:18.250> hi<00:00:18.580> Kyle<00:00:18.849> so<00:00:19.570> tell<00:00:19.900> us

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
headphone hi Joe hi Kyle so tell us

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.739 
headphone hi Joe hi Kyle so tell us
about<00:00:20.109> this<00:00:20.550> headphone<00:00:21.550> years<00:00:21.849> well<00:00:22.210> this<00:00:22.599> is

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
about this headphone years well this is

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.909 
about this headphone years well this is
something<00:00:22.900> we've<00:00:23.199> been<00:00:23.230> working<00:00:23.349> on<00:00:23.710> for<00:00:23.739> a

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
something we've been working on for a

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.899 
something we've been working on for a
number<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.189> years<00:00:24.310> and<00:00:26.130> basically<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.789> a

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:27.909 
number of years and basically it's a

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.359 
number of years and basically it's a
material<00:00:28.179> science<00:00:28.630> project<00:00:29.079> we're<00:00:29.980> really

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
material science project we're really

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.829 
material science project we're really
good<00:00:30.640> at<00:00:30.669> that<00:00:30.909> when<00:00:31.089> it<00:00:31.179> comes<00:00:31.269> to<00:00:31.480> cabling

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
good at that when it comes to cabling

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.479 
good at that when it comes to cabling
and<00:00:31.960> stuff<00:00:32.200> like<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.380> so<00:00:32.560> we<00:00:32.890> decided<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.340> try

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
and stuff like that so we decided to try

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.680 
and stuff like that so we decided to try
to<00:00:33.520> transpose<00:00:34.090> some<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.480> into<00:00:34.630> a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
to transpose some of that into a

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.189 
to transpose some of that into a
diaphragm<00:00:35.260> material<00:00:35.710> we<00:00:36.489> created<00:00:37.000> our<00:00:37.120> own

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
diaphragm material we created our own

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.479 
diaphragm material we created our own
we've<00:00:38.199> tried<00:00:38.440> all<00:00:38.469> types<00:00:39.219> of<00:00:39.340> different

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
we've tried all types of different

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.619 
we've tried all types of different
diaphragm<00:00:39.969> materials<00:00:40.329> that<00:00:40.449> were<00:00:40.510> available

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
diaphragm materials that were available

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.569 
diaphragm materials that were available
on<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.199> market<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.739> nothing<00:00:42.129> really<00:00:42.309> did

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
on the market and nothing really did

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.860 
on the market and nothing really did
what<00:00:42.699> we<00:00:42.789> wanted<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.179> to<00:00:43.300> do<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.690> had<00:00:43.780> to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
what we wanted it to do so we had to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.470 
what we wanted it to do so we had to
create<00:00:44.050> our<00:00:44.199> own<00:00:44.230> so<00:00:45.190> we<00:00:45.219> did<00:00:45.640> we<00:00:46.090> started<00:00:46.390> from

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
create our own so we did we started from

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.259 
create our own so we did we started from
scratch<00:00:46.600> with<00:00:47.079> proprietary<00:00:47.649> material<00:00:48.269> very

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
scratch with proprietary material very

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.130 
scratch with proprietary material very
very<00:00:49.660> thin<00:00:50.109> material<00:00:50.769> very<00:00:51.429> low<00:00:51.640> mass<00:00:52.109> it<00:00:53.109> has

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
very thin material very low mass it has

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.099 
very thin material very low mass it has
a<00:00:53.289> great<00:00:53.649> sound<00:00:54.309> character<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.359> it<00:00:55.390> and

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
a great sound character to it and

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.790 
a great sound character to it and
created<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.859> method<00:00:57.219> sure<00:00:58.199> why<00:00:59.199> let's<00:00:59.620> trace

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
created a method sure why let's trace

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.399 
created a method sure why let's trace
battery<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.609> we<00:01:01.359> spent<00:01:01.629> over<00:01:02.109> the<00:01:02.230> last

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
battery to it and we spent over the last

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.390 
battery to it and we spent over the last
six<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.920> nine<00:01:03.070> months<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:06.250> through

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
six to nine months going through

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.310 
six to nine months going through
hundreds<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:06.880> iterations<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.630> trace<00:01:07.870> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
hundreds of iterations of the trace and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.260 
hundreds of iterations of the trace and
the<00:01:08.800> diaphragm<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.460> match<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:09.940> align<00:01:10.240> it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
the diaphragm to match it and align it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.410 
the diaphragm to match it and align it
perfectly<00:01:10.810> with<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.860> magnet<00:01:12.640> field<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
perfectly with the magnet field so that

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.350 
perfectly with the magnet field so that
we<00:01:13.600> can<00:01:13.750> minimize<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.230> story

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
we can minimize the story

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
we can minimize the story
the<00:01:15.900> only<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> were<00:01:16.410> able<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.620> do<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.890> was

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the only way we were able to do that was

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
the only way we were able to do that was
bring<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.370> process<00:01:17.730> in<00:01:17.880> house<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.510> created

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bring the process in house so we created

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.900 
bring the process in house so we created
an<00:01:18.870> in-house<00:01:19.110> process<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> make<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> drivers

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
an in-house process to make the drivers

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.160 
an in-house process to make the drivers
which<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.540> buffalo<00:01:21.840> new<00:01:21.870> york<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:24.170> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
which we can in buffalo new york so and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
which we can in buffalo new york so and
so<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> planar<00:01:26.310> magnetic<00:01:26.550> headphone

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so this is a planar magnetic headphone

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
so this is a planar magnetic headphone
right<00:01:27.720> planar<00:01:28.170> magnetic<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.830> what<00:01:29.550> was

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
right planar magnetic and what was

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.770 
right planar magnetic and what was
interesting<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.390> talked<00:01:30.600> yesterday

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
interesting when we talked yesterday

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
interesting when we talked yesterday
about<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.160> this<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.090> can

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
about it is that this is a you can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
about it is that this is a you can
actually<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.930> diaphragm<00:01:34.410> in<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.740> I'm

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually see the diaphragm in here I'm

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually see the diaphragm in here I'm
going<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.100> move<00:01:35.580> it<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.030> because<00:01:36.450> sure<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
going to move it for you because sure I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.290 
going to move it for you because sure I
can<00:01:37.200> get<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> reflection<00:01:38.130> yep<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.910> that's<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
can get the reflection yep so that's the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.210 
can get the reflection yep so that's the
back<00:01:39.810> end<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> diaphragm<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:41.010> there

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
back end of the diaphragm right there

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
back end of the diaphragm right there
which<00:01:41.610> means<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.180> magnet<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.720> only<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.110> one

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
which means the magnet is only on one

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
which means the magnet is only on one
side<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.830> an<00:01:44.070> unusual<00:01:44.490> feature<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.690> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
side that's an unusual feature for a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
side that's an unusual feature for a
planar<00:01:45.990> magnetic<00:01:46.200> design<00:01:46.530> both<00:01:46.920> ways<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.700> can

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
planar magnetic design both ways you can

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.400 
planar magnetic design both ways you can
create<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.990> create<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.259> higher

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
create a little you can create a higher

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.080 
create a little you can create a higher
efficiency<00:01:49.860> obviously<00:01:50.280> put<00:01:50.550> magnets<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.910> both

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
efficiency obviously put magnets on both

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.820 
efficiency obviously put magnets on both
sides<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:52.050> we<00:01:52.170> wanted<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.530> attempt<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
sides but what we wanted to attempt to

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.290 
sides but what we wanted to attempt to
do<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.190> try<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> keep<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.759> open<00:01:54.180> as<00:01:54.270> possible

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
do is try to keep it as open as possible

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.270 
do is try to keep it as open as possible
right<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> place<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> magnet<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.190> back

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
right you place a magnet on the back

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.400 
right you place a magnet on the back
side<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.910> diaphragm<00:01:57.150> you're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
side of the diaphragm you're going to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.170 
side of the diaphragm you're going to
hear<00:01:58.560> reflections<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.400> magnet<00:01:59.759> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
hear reflections off the magnet you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.510 
hear reflections off the magnet you
can't<00:02:00.420> avoid<00:02:00.660> them<00:02:00.869> yeah<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.440> he<00:02:02.040> didn't<00:02:02.399> want

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
can't avoid them yeah and he didn't want

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
can't avoid them yeah and he didn't want
that<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> happen<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.600> had<00:02:03.810> done<00:02:04.080> is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that to happen so what we had done is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280 
that to happen so what we had done is
created<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.280> powerful<00:02:05.550> one<00:02:06.479> piece<00:02:06.780> single

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
created a very powerful one piece single

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
created a very powerful one piece single
magnet<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.740> custom<00:02:08.220> magnet<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> front

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
magnet a custom magnet for the front

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
magnet a custom magnet for the front
side<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.929> try<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> keep<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> efficiency<00:02:10.800> as

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
side to try to keep the efficiency as

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
side to try to keep the efficiency as
high<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:11.190> possible<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.959> then<00:02:12.959> place<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
high as possible and then place the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.560 
high as possible and then place the
diaphragm<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.489> as<00:02:14.580> close<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.910> pause<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
diaphragm over it as close to pause and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
diaphragm over it as close to pause and
you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.050> take<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> pan<00:02:16.530> off<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.250> those

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
you can take the pan off on one of those

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.010 
you can take the pan off on one of those
right<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.610> sure<00:02:17.970> these<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.570> magnetically

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
right there sure these are magnetically

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
right there sure these are magnetically
held<00:02:19.290> pads<00:02:19.530> they<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.920> ran<00:02:20.010> right<00:02:20.040> off<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
held pads they just ran right off and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.449 
held pads they just ran right off and
you<00:02:20.730> see<00:02:20.970> there's<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.780> magnetic<00:02:22.590> at

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
you see there's the the magnetic at

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.550 
you see there's the the magnetic at
least<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.299> can<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.810> grid<00:02:25.080> structure

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
least the you can see the grid structure

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.070 
least the you can see the grid structure
of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> magnet<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> single<00:02:27.420> piece

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
of the magnet but it is a single piece

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.990 
of the magnet but it is a single piece
magnet<00:02:28.560> back<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.010> basically<00:02:29.489> slot

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
magnet back there was basically slot

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.550 
magnet back there was basically slot
right<00:02:30.209> in<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.570> right<00:02:30.840> we're<00:02:31.080> using<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.350> steel

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
right in it right we're using a steel

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.830 
right in it right we're using a steel
baffle<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.360> concentrate<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.390> field<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:33.750> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
baffle to concentrate the field so it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.940 
baffle to concentrate the field so it
doesn't<00:02:34.080> rip<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.350> hearing<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.830> of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
doesn't rip and hearing it out of

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.039 
doesn't rip and hearing it out of
somebody<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:36.030> bottom<00:02:36.330> line<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
somebody but bottom line is that the

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.000 
somebody but bottom line is that the
single<00:02:37.980> piece<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.880> with<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.769> diaphragm<00:02:40.769> it's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
single piece with with a diaphragm it's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220 
single piece with with a diaphragm it's
all<00:02:41.190> custom-made<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.970> diaphragm<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
all custom-made the diaphragm the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.080 
all custom-made the diaphragm the
drivers<00:02:43.650> done<00:02:43.890> we're<00:02:44.310> pretty<00:02:44.519> much<00:02:44.670> done<00:02:44.730> with

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
drivers done we're pretty much done with

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.670 
drivers done we're pretty much done with
that<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:45.870> we're<00:02:46.049> working<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.500> is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that what we're working on now is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.370 
that what we're working on now is
acoustics<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.850> pattern<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.959> stumbled

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
acoustics this pattern here we stumbled

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.570 
acoustics this pattern here we stumbled
on<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.500> works<00:02:49.799> really<00:02:49.950> well<00:02:50.100> we<00:02:50.430> haven't

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
on it works really well we haven't

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.729 
on it works really well we haven't
optimized<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.269> yet<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.110> acts<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.500> very

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
optimized it yet but it acts like a very

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.350 
optimized it yet but it acts like a very
nice<00:02:52.860> diffuser<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.760> doesn't<00:02:54.090> load<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
nice diffuser it doesn't load the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.210 
nice diffuser it doesn't load the
diaphragm<00:02:54.810> properly<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.980> we've<00:02:56.130> been

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
diaphragm properly and so we've been

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.009 
diaphragm properly and so we've been
prototyping<00:02:56.430> using<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.780> will<00:02:57.930> be

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
prototyping using this this will be

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.500 
prototyping using this this will be
modified<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.620> isn't<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> final<00:02:59.160> design<00:02:59.510> we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
modified this isn't the final design we

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.340 
modified this isn't the final design we
haven't<00:03:00.690> decided<00:03:00.900> where<00:03:01.080> they're<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.290> to

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
haven't decided where they're going to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.960 
haven't decided where they're going to
stay<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.799> but<00:03:01.980> probably<00:03:02.370> something

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
stay with it but probably something

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.150 
stay with it but probably something
similar<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.330> this

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
similar to this

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.020 
similar to this
is<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.580> final<00:03:04.910> version<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:07.030> so

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
is going to be the final version and so

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.580 
is going to be the final version and so
far<00:03:08.210> people<00:03:08.390> have<00:03:08.540> liked<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.840> we<00:03:09.290> haven't<00:03:09.500> had

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
far people have liked it we haven't had

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.900 
far people have liked it we haven't had
any<00:03:09.620> real<00:03:09.890> negative<00:03:10.070> comments<00:03:10.580> on<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> look

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
any real negative comments on the look

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.610 
any real negative comments on the look
so<00:03:11.090> maybe<00:03:11.270> we'll<00:03:11.420> stick<00:03:11.600> with<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.780> yeah<00:03:12.320> scream

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
so maybe we'll stick with it yeah scream

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.250 
so maybe we'll stick with it yeah scream
so<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.880> had<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.540> chance<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.870> listen<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.110> these

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
so I I had a chance to listen to these

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.390 
so I I had a chance to listen to these
headphones<00:03:15.440> yesterday<00:03:16.010> one<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
headphones yesterday one of the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.620 
headphones yesterday one of the
characteristics<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:17.180> planar<00:03:17.420> magnetic

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
characteristics of planar magnetic

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.480 
characteristics of planar magnetic
headphones<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.410> lot<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.650> times<00:03:18.830> is<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.130> there

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
headphones a lot of times is that there

headphone has and this is a prototype so
it's<00:03:31.240> want<00:03:32.240> comment<00:03:32.630> too<00:03:32.810> much<00:03:32.840> on<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.260> sound

day it was fairly good though and but it

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.100 
day it was fairly good though and but it
that<00:03:36.770> was<00:03:37.040> unique<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.090> sense<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.840> it

that was unique in the sense that the it
was<00:03:39.350> seemed<00:03:39.890> much<00:03:40.190> quicker<00:03:40.550> than<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.510> planar

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
was seemed much quicker than the planar
