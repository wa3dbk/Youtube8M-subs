cook it for probably 20 minutes it
depends<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.519> lot<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:46.730> how<00:03:47.120> thick<00:03:47.450> your<00:03:47.600> fish<00:03:47.810> is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
obviously if it's thicker it's gonna

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.380 
obviously if it's thicker it's gonna
take<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.340> little<00:03:49.459> longer<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.000> somewhere
