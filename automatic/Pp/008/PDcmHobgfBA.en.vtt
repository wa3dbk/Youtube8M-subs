in a non-title match is going to be
Kevin<00:02:19.270> Owens<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.650> would<00:02:20.800> set<00:02:21.190> up<00:02:21.400> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
Kevin Owens and that would set up a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.150 
Kevin Owens and that would set up a
championship<00:02:22.690> match<00:02:22.720> down<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.230> line<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.830> if

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.550 
a WTB wrestler in an ECW ring I know
very<00:04:38.120> hard<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.540> believe<00:04:38.780> he<00:04:39.080> did<00:04:39.350> if<00:04:39.530> you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
very hard to believe he did if you

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.710 
very hard to believe he did if you
weren't<00:04:39.800> there<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:41.180> probably<00:04:41.390> wouldn't

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
weren't there you probably wouldn't

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.910 
weren't there you probably wouldn't
believe<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.140> i<00:04:42.200> don't<00:04:42.350> know<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.620> match

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
believe it i don't know if that match

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.050 
believe it i don't know if that match
has<00:04:43.100> been<00:04:43.130> included<00:04:43.580> on<00:04:43.820> either<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.920> ECW

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
volumes I think there's a volume 3

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560 
volumes I think there's a volume 3
coming<00:04:48.890> out<00:04:48.980> sooner<00:04:49.220> than<00:04:49.340> later<00:04:49.490> no<00:04:49.880> volume<00:04:50.270> 3

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
coming out sooner than later no volume 3

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.600 
coming out sooner than later no volume 3
is<00:04:50.630> out<00:04:50.810> that's<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.740> one<00:04:51.860> with<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.040> bwo<00:04:52.520> I
