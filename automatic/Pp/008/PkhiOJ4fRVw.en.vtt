my name is Berta switowski and today I'm
stopping<00:00:12.570> by<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.290> show<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:14.130> distress

stopping by to show you some distress

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.230 
stopping by to show you some distress
paint<00:00:15.389> layering<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.410> stamping<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.090> is

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
paint layering with stamping so this is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880 
paint layering with stamping so this is
using<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> really<00:00:19.230> great<00:00:19.470> properties

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
using one of the really great properties

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
using one of the really great properties
about<00:00:20.520> distress<00:00:21.000> paints<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
about distress paints which is that the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
about distress paints which is that the
that<00:00:22.439> they're<00:00:22.650> opaque<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.390> going

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
that they're opaque and so we're going

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
that they're opaque and so we're going
to<00:00:24.660> stamp<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.199> couple<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> layers<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.670> can

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
to stamp a couple of layers so you can

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.410 
to stamp a couple of layers so you can
really<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.599> these<00:00:28.460> inks<00:00:29.460> layered<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.000> top<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
really see these inks layered on top of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
really see these inks layered on top of
each<00:00:30.539> other<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.019> I've<00:00:31.859> picked<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.250> four

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
each other so I've picked out four

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360 
each other so I've picked out four

favorite classic background stamps from
them<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.850> I'm<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> start<00:01:09.990> out

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
them and I'm actually going to start out

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.370 
them and I'm actually going to start out
by<00:01:10.580> using<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.700> stamp<00:01:12.000> image<00:01:12.270> egg<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> creating

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
by using my stamp image egg and creating

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.780 
by using my stamp image egg and creating
a<00:01:13.590> background<00:01:14.220> positioner<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.750> stamp

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
a background positioner for this stamp

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.340 
a background positioner for this stamp
so<00:01:17.790> I've<00:01:17.909> inked<00:01:18.150> my<00:01:18.270> stamp<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.110> some

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so I've inked my stamp up with some

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.390 
so I've inked my stamp up with some
stays<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.860> ink<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.840> put<00:01:22.170> my<00:01:22.830> background

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
stays on ink and I put my background

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
stays on ink and I put my background
into<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> corner<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.869> top<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.470> little

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
into the corner on top of my little

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.609 
into the corner on top of my little
plastic<00:01:26.189> piece<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.200> then<00:01:28.200> press<00:01:28.439> down

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
plastic piece here and then press down

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
plastic piece here and then press down
this<00:01:29.070> definitely<00:01:29.549> doesn't<00:01:29.790> need<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
this definitely doesn't need to be

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
this definitely doesn't need to be
perfect<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.810> needs<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> give<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.500> an

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
perfect it just needs to give you an

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.789 
perfect it just needs to give you an
impression<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.909> use<00:01:33.240> later<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
impression that you can use later so I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
impression that you can use later so I
didn't<00:01:35.189> even<00:01:35.310> ink<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.670> my<00:01:35.700> stamp<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.390> well

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
didn't even ink up my stamp that well

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
didn't even ink up my stamp that well
but<00:01:36.720> that's<00:01:36.900> okay<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:37.950> my

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
but that's okay I got a little bit on my

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
but that's okay I got a little bit on my
fingers<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.909> also<00:01:39.180> okay<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> goal

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
fingers but that's also okay the goal

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
fingers but that's also okay the goal
here<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.159> able<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.610> line<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.000> your

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here is just to be able to line up your

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.200 
here is just to be able to line up your
stamp<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.470> approximately<00:01:44.280> where<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
stamp and know approximately where you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.660 
stamp and know approximately where you
want<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.509> new<00:01:45.659> stamped<00:01:46.049> image<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.250> now

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
want your new stamped image to go so now

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
want your new stamped image to go so now
you<00:01:47.729> need<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> clean<00:01:48.329> off<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.479> stamp<00:01:48.840> really

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you need to clean off your stamp really

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.319 
you need to clean off your stamp really
well<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.829> none<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.220> transfers<00:01:50.759> over<00:01:50.970> when

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
well so none of this transfers over when

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
well so none of this transfers over when
we<00:01:51.479> use<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.869> paint<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.280> start

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
we use the paint and then we can start

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
we use the paint and then we can start
stamping<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> creating<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.659> our<00:01:54.810> paint<00:01:55.020> now

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stamping and creating with our paint now

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
the spots covered and this will help the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.580 
the spots covered and this will help the
colors<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.270> blend<00:03:02.600> together<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:03.440> can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
colors really blend together you can

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.160 
colors really blend together you can
step<00:03:03.890> skip<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.370> step<00:03:04.670> if<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.240> want<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.990> be

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
step skip this step if you want it to be

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.980 
step skip this step if you want it to be
less<00:03:06.830> marbleized<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.120> less<00:03:08.390> mixed<00:03:08.840> together

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
less marbleized and less mixed together

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.470 
less marbleized and less mixed together
but<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:09.740> really<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.550> water<00:03:10.670> effect<00:03:11.150> and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
but I really like the water effect and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.370 
but I really like the water effect and
then<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:14.360> can<00:03:14.830> press<00:03:15.830> your<00:03:16.070> paper<00:03:16.280> into<00:03:16.670> your

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
then you can press your paper into your

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.560 
then you can press your paper into your
background<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.940> use<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.090> sheet<00:03:20.420> of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
background I like to use a sheet of

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.230 
background I like to use a sheet of
paper<00:03:21.470> over<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.980> top<00:03:22.100> when<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> press<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:22.940> down

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
paper over the top when I press it down

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.180 
paper over the top when I press it down
so<00:03:23.960> that<00:03:23.990> I<00:03:24.140> can<00:03:24.320> avoid<00:03:24.500> getting<00:03:24.680> as<00:03:24.950> much

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
so that I can avoid getting as much

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
so that I can avoid getting as much
paint<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.970> my<00:03:26.150> hands<00:03:26.390> as<00:03:26.570> possible<00:03:26.720> even

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
paint on my hands as possible even

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.780 
paint on my hands as possible even
though<00:03:27.530> you're<00:03:27.830> probably<00:03:28.070> going<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:28.670> get

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
though you're probably going to get

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.160 
though you're probably going to get
messy<00:03:29.090> during<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:29.510> technique<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:32.110> now<00:03:33.110> we

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
messy during this technique so now we

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.950 
messy during this technique so now we
have<00:03:33.410> this<00:03:33.530> really<00:03:33.620> great<00:03:33.920> background<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.270> I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960

what<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.230> want<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.530> do<00:04:15.680> is<00:04:15.890> shift<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.580> a<00:04:16.820> little

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
what I want to do is shift it a little

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.200 
what I want to do is shift it a little
bit<00:04:17.989> off<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.380> side<00:04:18.710> in<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.820> way<00:04:19.970> that<00:04:20.180> I

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
bit off to the side in the way that I

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.240 
bit off to the side in the way that I
want<00:04:20.450> my<00:04:20.570> shadow<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.989> be<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:22.010> probably

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
want my shadow to be and it probably

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.290 
want my shadow to be and it probably
won't<00:04:22.700> stamp<00:04:23.090> perfectly<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:23.870> that's<00:04:24.080> okay

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
won't stamp perfectly but that's okay

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.290 
won't stamp perfectly but that's okay
so<00:04:26.630> I<00:04:26.660> can<00:04:26.900> put<00:04:27.020> my<00:04:27.139> stamp<00:04:27.349> of<00:04:27.500> magic<00:04:27.800> down<00:04:28.300> then

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
so I can put my stamp of magic down then

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.930 
so I can put my stamp of magic down then
leave<00:04:29.509> it<00:04:29.660> there<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.190> then<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.220> just<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:31.759> to

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
leave it there and then I just need to

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.870 
leave it there and then I just need to
remember<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.419> stamp<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:34.130> same<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.819> I

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
remember to stamp it the same way that I

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.860 
remember to stamp it the same way that I
had<00:04:35.319> my<00:04:36.319> little<00:04:36.819> stamp<00:04:37.819> of<00:04:37.970> entry<00:04:38.180> before<00:04:38.539> so

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
had my little stamp of entry before so

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.080 
had my little stamp of entry before so
make<00:04:39.110> sure<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.410> match<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:39.620> up<00:04:40.009> so<00:04:40.639> I'm<00:04:40.880> going

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
make sure you match that up so I'm going

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.950 
make sure you match that up so I'm going
to<00:04:41.360> use<00:04:41.630> some<00:04:42.410> picket<00:04:42.710> fence<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:44.330> that'll<00:04:44.840> go

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
to use some picket fence and that'll go

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.870 
to use some picket fence and that'll go
down<00:04:44.990> first<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.680> then<00:04:45.770> over<00:04:46.160> top<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.580> it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
down first and then over top of it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.390 
down first and then over top of it
broken<00:04:47.539> china<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.440> once<00:04:48.620> again<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.919> made<00:04:49.250> sure

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
broken china and once again I made sure

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.460 
broken china and once again I made sure
to<00:04:49.520> mix<00:04:49.639> in<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.000> white<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.569> blue<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.259> that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
to mix in the white and the blue so that

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.800 
to mix in the white and the blue so that
there<00:04:51.979> aren't<00:04:52.400> any<00:04:52.610> places<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.150> are<00:04:53.360> super

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
there aren't any places that are super

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.839 
there aren't any places that are super
weight<00:04:53.990> because<00:04:54.349> obviously<00:04:54.610> plain<00:04:55.610> white

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
weight because obviously plain white

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.510 
weight because obviously plain white
won't<00:04:56.150> show<00:04:56.389> up<00:04:56.419> very<00:04:56.720> well<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:57.500> I'm<00:04:58.069> going<00:04:58.490> to

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
won't show up very well so I'm going to

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.999 
won't show up very well so I'm going to
spray<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.270> couple<00:04:59.599> times<00:04:59.840> with<00:05:00.080> my<00:05:00.349> mister

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
spray this a couple times with my mister

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.920 
spray this a couple times with my mister
again<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.550> then<00:05:02.000> remember<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.479> flip<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.840> in

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
again and then remember to flip it in

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.159 
again and then remember to flip it in
the<00:05:02.960> direction<00:05:03.139> that<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.590> planned<00:05:03.919> and<00:05:05.110> try<00:05:06.110> to

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
the direction that I planned and try to

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.930 
the direction that I planned and try to
line<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.409> up<00:05:06.650> with<00:05:06.710> my<00:05:06.949> stamp-a-ma-jig<00:05:07.430> you

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
line it up with my stamp-a-ma-jig you

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.170 
line it up with my stamp-a-ma-jig you
can<00:05:08.090> also<00:05:08.210> just<00:05:08.539> free<00:05:08.990> like<00:05:09.979> just<00:05:10.250> free-form

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
can also just free like just free-form

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.909 
can also just free like just free-form
this<00:05:11.419> you're<00:05:12.409> going<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.560> end<00:05:12.740> up<00:05:12.770> with

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
this you're going to end up with

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.189 
this you're going to end up with
something<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.430> little<00:05:13.699> bit<00:05:13.819> unpredictable<00:05:14.199> but

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
something a little bit unpredictable but

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.420 
something a little bit unpredictable but
sometimes<00:05:15.680> that's<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.039> fun<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.340> playing

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
sometimes that's the fun of playing

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.029 
sometimes that's the fun of playing
around<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.750> now<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.020> have<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.710> really

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
around and now you have this really

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.180 
around and now you have this really
great<00:05:19.900> multi<00:05:20.900> layers<00:05:21.169> stamped<00:05:21.710> background

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
great multi layers stamped background

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.790 
great multi layers stamped background
and<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.569> more<00:05:23.780> paint<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.169> use<00:05:24.349> in<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.620> less

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
and the more paint you use in the less

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.219 
and the more paint you use in the less
water<00:05:25.009> you<00:05:25.220> use<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.909> less<00:05:26.120> transparent<00:05:27.020> it

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
water you use the less transparent it

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.399 
water you use the less transparent it
will<00:05:27.380> be<00:05:27.759> so<00:05:28.759> this<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.090> pretty<00:05:29.479> transparent

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
will be so this is pretty transparent

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.379 
will be so this is pretty transparent
but<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.680> still<00:05:31.009> get<00:05:31.159> a<00:05:31.219> lot<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:32.090> fun

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
but you still get a lot of the fun

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.200 
but you still get a lot of the fun
effect<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:34.130> stamping<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:34.699> you<00:05:34.909> can<00:05:35.060> add

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
effect of the stamping and you can add

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.390 
effect of the stamping and you can add
as<00:05:35.360> many<00:05:35.570> layers<00:05:35.840> of<00:05:36.020> paint<00:05:36.169> as<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.590> want<00:05:36.949> you

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
as many layers of paint as you want you

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.149 
as many layers of paint as you want you
could<00:05:37.550> even<00:05:37.759> add<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.150> layer<00:05:38.659> of<00:05:38.870> solid<00:05:39.139> or<00:05:39.500> add

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
could even add a layer of solid or add
