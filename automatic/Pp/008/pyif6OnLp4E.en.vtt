recommend<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.850> getting<00:00:45.090> Spanky's<00:00:45.750> these

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
recommend it like getting Spanky's these

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900 
recommend it like getting Spanky's these
are<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> Spanky's<00:00:46.800> videos<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
are the Spanky's videos right here and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
are the Spanky's videos right here and
why<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> recommend<00:00:49.050> getting<00:00:49.140> Spanky's<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
why I recommend getting Spanky's is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
why I recommend getting Spanky's is
because<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> don't<00:00:50.610> use<00:00:50.969> Spanky's<00:00:51.680> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
because when you don't use Spanky's it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040 
because when you don't use Spanky's it
when<00:00:52.949> you're<00:00:53.070> stretching<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.870> shorts

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
when you're stretching like your shorts

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.040 
when you're stretching like your shorts
go<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.629> good<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
go right up and so it's just good to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
go right up and so it's just good to
wash<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.649> keys<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.190> protection<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.149> I
