outside<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.440> think<00:03:04.430> at<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> moment<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:05.630> are

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
outside I think at the moment we are

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.100 
outside I think at the moment we are
getting<00:03:06.160> more<00:03:07.160> than<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.520> thousand<00:03:08.030> farmers<00:03:08.510> on

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
getting more than a thousand farmers on

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.770 
getting more than a thousand farmers on
a<00:03:09.170> yearly<00:03:09.560> basis<00:03:10.150> visiting<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.270> farm<00:03:11.510> and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
a yearly basis visiting the farm and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.920 
a yearly basis visiting the farm and
students<00:03:12.680> come<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.340> look<00:03:13.820> at<00:03:14.030> how<00:03:14.330> this<00:03:14.630> home

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
students come to look at how this home

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
students come to look at how this home
is<00:03:15.110> being<00:03:15.320> run<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.950> what<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.430> doing<00:03:16.610> and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
is being run and what we are doing and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120 
is being run and what we are doing and
while<00:03:18.950> hopefully<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.670> has<00:03:19.940> an<00:03:20.150> impact

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
while hopefully that has an impact

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.880 
while hopefully that has an impact
