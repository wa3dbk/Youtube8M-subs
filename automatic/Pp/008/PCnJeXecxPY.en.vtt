the moon is hanging low it looks red for

the same reason that sunsets are red the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
the same reason that sunsets are red the
atmosphere<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.100> full<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.489> aerosols<00:02:59.850> much

in diameter these aerosols scatter blue

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.280 
in diameter these aerosols scatter blue
light<00:03:07.019> while<00:03:07.799> leaving<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> red<00:03:08.370> behind<00:03:09.290> for

light while leaving the red behind for
this<00:03:10.410> reason<00:03:10.680> red<00:03:11.579> blue<00:03:11.910> moons<00:03:12.150> are<00:03:12.450> far<00:03:12.930> more

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this reason red blue moons are far more

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.640 
this reason red blue moons are far more

common than blue blue moons sounds
absurd<00:03:17.060> yes<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.079> what<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> blue<00:03:19.530> moon

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
absurd yes but that's what a blue moon

absurd yes but that's what a blue moon
