00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.550
 the preliminary project of the hi career to 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.800
 all this n ignore so yeah today 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.080
 we will present our career 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.060
 really more in detail than on the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.379
 old videos and so goes first 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
 how did you say it in the last 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.550
 video that talked about this career mode 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.220
 we will do two so I 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.470
 would take the fc lorient and beyond said 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.149
 will you give him we'll say the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.340
 queens park rangers so here we go 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.680
 go see right now 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 the workforce and then the budget of these two 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.980
 teams 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.760
 go see it's going to get stuck down by lorient 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.520
 in league 1 lorient lorient fc lorient 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.820
 So that's what you're doing 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.640
 think 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.230
 ba had reviewed the stats level of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.730
 players and it's to see when we have 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.050
 even good little players alain 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.630
 traoré in front I think it's alain 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.800
 traoré and clement guy behind we have a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.500
 good little caretaker audard 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.149
 we do not have too much budget 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.130
 on the other hand only 3 not even 4 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.299
 million but hey I think there will be 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.990
 still mean to do something 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.970
 with this team 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.299
 and then yes, it's a career 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.670
 so that's the goal of improving his team 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 as we go we'll see them 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.700
 now queens park rangers 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.729
 against a team not too bad a little 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.340
 me yeah that's still and as a 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.780
 little higher I think that the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.420
 hold on yeah yeah then I get you that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.270
 lorient with the goal is much more 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.770
 interesting do you see there are some good 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.159
 players also to these is julio 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.049
 Cesar who is barred by possible data 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.540
 also misses very frankly there's guys 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.460
 to langoat too bad and a way to 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.619
 do something with these two teams there 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.280
 I sincerely think that you have us 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.200
 proposed two good teams 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.450
 a big kudos to you I think it's ok 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.050
 be very interesting to do that so 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.960
 afterwards regarding the 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.860
 the stream of videos I think we will do 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.840
 an episode a week or an episode 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 all a week and a half I think 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 this is basically we will try to you 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.370
 propose each one so basically by a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 episode lorient to episode qpr all 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.000
 weeks and a half wholesale so no 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.400
 every three weeks there will be four 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.650
 videos if you prefer that's after that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270
 are going to have what you will be offered in 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.970
 a video normally it will be very 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.530
 definitely a month of play so after 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.970
 we will see there will be months when we will have 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.290
 matches a lot more games to play 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.120
 we may have some concise 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.950
 mulleras also we may try to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.260
 you put the best times and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.460
 so we're going to have anyway here 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 in each video there will normally be 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.640
 a month of play and then we'll see 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.040
 according to the number of matches 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 will play concise mulleras and here you are 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.530
 see it's big matches we'll see 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.180
 how will organize in this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.000
 months there so here and then you'll see 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.880
 beat soon I think we're going on 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 will be able to attack the first episode 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.780
 in the week I think in the week 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.380
 or in the weeks that will come in 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.750
 the coming days 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.030
 so you will most likely have the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.500
 first episode of his two careers 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.620
 in a very short time 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.310
 and then we'll do what a little bit 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.530
 of falls 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.110
