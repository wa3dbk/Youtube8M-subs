funny<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.670> there<00:00:17.820> were<00:00:17.910> parts

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
funny and I think that there were parts

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
funny and I think that there were parts
that<00:00:18.330> were<00:00:18.510> funny<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:18.930> overall<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.859> guy<00:00:20.039> was

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that were funny but overall the guy was

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.630 
that were funny but overall the guy was
such<00:00:21.289> he<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.529> had<00:00:22.680> such<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> nasty<00:00:23.189> way<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
such he just had such a nasty way of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
such he just had such a nasty way of
talking<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.380> that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
talking that I really don't think that

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
talking that I really don't think that
it<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> good<00:00:25.980> representation<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
it was a good representation of what I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.410 
it was a good representation of what I
want<00:00:27.630> path<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.050> power<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.500> DB<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> do

making<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.669> new<00:00:32.790> squad<00:00:33.090> now<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.420> i'm<00:00:33.480> doing

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
making a new squad now and i'm doing

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
making a new squad now and i'm doing
what<00:00:33.989> i<00:00:34.050> would<00:00:34.260> call<00:00:34.410> speed<00:00:34.739> building<00:00:35.070> um<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
what i would call speed building um and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.020 
what i would call speed building um and
that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.690> buying<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.530> team<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.070> essentially<00:00:38.610> 20

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that is buying a team in essentially 20

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
that is buying a team in essentially 20
minute<00:00:39.270> i<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.690> team<00:00:39.899> actually<00:00:40.140> only

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
minute i think this team actually only

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
minute i think this team actually only
took<00:00:40.620> me<00:00:40.829> 12<00:00:41.190> minutes<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.730> make<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.270> they

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
took me 12 minutes to make because they

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
took me 12 minutes to make because they
were<00:00:42.780> once<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.680> conceptualized<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.760> were

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
were once I conceptualized it they were

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
were once I conceptualized it they were
very<00:00:45.390> very<00:00:45.510> cheap<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.289> part<00:00:46.469> falcao

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
very very cheap for the most part falcao

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
very very cheap for the most part falcao
is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.940> most<00:00:48.180> expensive<00:00:48.420> player<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is the most expensive player in this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
is the most expensive player in this
side<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.309> we've<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.579> Falcao<00:00:50.940> arta<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> run

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
side and so we've got Falcao arta to run

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.119 
side and so we've got Falcao arta to run
an<00:00:51.930> order<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> run<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.829> those<00:00:52.890> players

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
an order to run is one of those players

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
an order to run is one of those players
that<00:00:53.250> I've<00:00:53.430> loved<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.059> many<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.750> FIFA's<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.410> a

on chemistry but a German from the
Bundesliga<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.639> give<00:03:58.760> me<00:03:58.819> nine<00:03:58.940> chemistry<00:03:59.329> but

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
Bundesliga to give me nine chemistry but

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.869 
Bundesliga to give me nine chemistry but
Mario<00:04:00.500> Goetze<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.889> obviously<00:04:01.340> does<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.729> he's

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
Mario Goetze it obviously does that he's

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.119

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
end up having to lay it back and I'd

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.420 
end up having to lay it back and I'd
rather<00:05:56.539> just<00:05:56.870> retain<00:05:57.229> possession<00:05:57.440> around<00:05:58.190> the

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
rather just retain possession around the

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.980 
rather just retain possession around the
around<00:05:58.880> their<00:05:59.060> box<00:05:59.240> area<00:05:59.510> and<00:05:59.659> you<00:05:59.780> know<00:05:59.870> what

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
around their box area and you know what

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.800 
around their box area and you know what
the<00:06:00.110> for<00:06:00.320> triple<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:01.330> amazing<00:06:02.330> for<00:06:02.510> keeping

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
the for triple to is amazing for keeping

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.240 
the for triple to is amazing for keeping
hold<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.110> possession<00:06:03.229> in<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:04.010> around<00:06:04.159> your

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
hold of possession in and around your

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.550 
hold of possession in and around your
opponent's<00:06:04.669> box<00:06:04.880> and<00:06:05.120> that's<00:06:05.720> largely<00:06:05.960> due<00:06:06.530> to

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
opponent's box and that's largely due to

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.870 
opponent's box and that's largely due to
the<00:06:07.070> fact<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.370> think<00:06:07.460> that<00:06:07.639> you<00:06:07.729> have<00:06:07.849> to

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
the fact I think that you have to

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.640 
the fact I think that you have to
holding<00:06:08.300> mids<00:06:08.449> thats<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.840> bit<00:06:09.139> outside<00:06:09.590> the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
holding mids thats it a bit outside the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.529 
holding mids thats it a bit outside the
box<00:06:09.800> and<00:06:10.099> so<00:06:10.220> it's<00:06:10.340> really<00:06:10.430> easy<00:06:10.940> to<00:06:11.210> work<00:06:11.240> it

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
box and so it's really easy to work it

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.360 
box and so it's really easy to work it
from<00:06:11.690> one<00:06:11.930> side<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.409> other<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.919> I<00:06:13.310> very

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
from one side to the other and I very

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.279 
from one side to the other and I very
very<00:06:13.729> much<00:06:14.120> enjoy<00:06:14.599> that<00:06:14.780> when<00:06:14.930> I<00:06:14.960> was<00:06:15.050> at<00:06:15.199> the

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
very much enjoy that when I was at the

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.820 
very much enjoy that when I was at the
EA<00:06:15.500> event<00:06:16.190> in<00:06:16.750> Guildford<00:06:17.750> earlier<00:06:18.500> in

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
EA event in Guildford earlier in

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.520 
EA event in Guildford earlier in
September<00:06:19.490> I<00:06:19.669> found<00:06:20.659> that<00:06:20.870> the<00:06:20.960> for<00:06:21.139> triple<00:06:21.409> to

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
September I found that the for triple to

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.140 
September I found that the for triple to
was<00:06:21.680> one<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:21.919> my<00:06:22.010> favorite<00:06:22.520> formations<00:06:23.030> to

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
was one of my favorite formations to

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.189 
was one of my favorite formations to
play<00:06:23.300> in<00:06:23.389> the<00:06:23.479> game<00:06:23.630> and<00:06:23.750> that's<00:06:23.840> because<00:06:24.050> I

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
play in the game and that's because I

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.409 
play in the game and that's because I
was<00:06:24.380> really<00:06:24.650> able<00:06:24.830> to<00:06:25.039> control<00:06:25.909> possession

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
was really able to control possession

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.089 
was really able to control possession
and<00:06:26.750> kind<00:06:27.020> of<00:06:27.080> boss<00:06:27.289> the<00:06:27.560> way<00:06:27.680> I<00:06:27.710> wanted<00:06:27.979> the

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
and kind of boss the way I wanted the

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:29.710 
and kind of boss the way I wanted the
game<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.280> be<00:06:28.490> played<00:06:28.520> so<00:06:28.849> I'm<00:06:28.940> hoping<00:06:29.300> that

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
game to be played so I'm hoping that

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.089 
game to be played so I'm hoping that
that<00:06:29.870> formation<00:06:30.199> will<00:06:30.440> feel<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.620> same<00:06:30.919> for

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
that formation will feel the same for

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.439 
that formation will feel the same for
ultimate<00:06:31.520> team<00:06:31.639> but<00:06:31.789> with<00:06:31.880> ultimate<00:06:32.270> team

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
ultimate team but with ultimate team

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.810 
ultimate team but with ultimate team

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
everything's just so much quicker as you

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.330

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
little bit different than it would have

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:38.910
