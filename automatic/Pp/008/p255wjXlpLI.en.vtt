standard<00:00:51.100> tuning<00:00:51.460> I'm<00:00:52.000> going<00:00:52.149> to<00:00:52.239> put<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
standard tuning I'm going to put the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.430 
standard tuning I'm going to put the
capo<00:00:52.870> on<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.230> 3rd<00:00:53.890> fret<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.960> we've<00:00:56.199> got

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
capo on the 3rd fret and then we've got

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.619 
capo on the 3rd fret and then we've got
two<00:00:56.860> basic<00:00:57.280> shapes<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.300> are<00:00:58.420> almost

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
two basic shapes that are almost

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.430 
two basic shapes that are almost
identical<00:00:59.340> a<00:01:00.340> little<00:01:00.730> trick<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:02.199> first

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
identical a little trick and the first

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.569 
identical a little trick and the first
one's<00:01:02.710> going<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:02.949> be<00:01:03.039> like<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:03.370> we're<00:01:03.489> going

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
one's going to be like this we're going

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.090 
one's going to be like this we're going
to<00:01:03.640> imagine<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.479> capo<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.960> zero<00:01:05.320> then

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
to imagine that the capo is zero then

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.040 
to imagine that the capo is zero then
we've<00:01:06.220> got<00:01:06.399> 1<00:01:06.640> 2<00:01:06.670> 3<00:01:06.940> 4<00:01:07.360> 4th<00:01:08.259> 4th<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.280> fret<00:01:09.700> up

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
we've got 1 2 3 4 4th 4th the fret up

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.800 
we've got 1 2 3 4 4th 4th the fret up
index<00:01:11.050> finger<00:01:11.289> on<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.440> B<00:01:11.649> string<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.720> we're

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
index finger on the B string then we're

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.249 
index finger on the B string then we're
going<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:13.990> do<00:01:14.080> pinky<00:01:14.530> on<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:15.630> whole<00:01:16.630> step<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:17.080> and

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
going to do pinky on a whole step up and

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:25.340 
going to do pinky on a whole step up and
ring<00:01:17.890> finger<00:01:18.160> on<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.310> whole<00:01:18.520> step<00:01:18.789> up

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.060 

so<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.130> all<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.400> need<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:29.120> six<00:01:30.120> six<00:01:31.110> four<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so that's all we need a six six four and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.460 
so that's all we need a six six four and
then<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> open<00:01:33.390> high<00:01:33.600> E<00:01:33.630> right<00:01:34.020> there

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.670 

then<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.860> same<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.310> whole<00:01:38.580> step<00:01:38.880> down

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
then the same thing a whole step down

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.460 
then the same thing a whole step down
but<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.950> bar<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:42.330> index<00:01:42.720> finger<00:01:43.020> across<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but I bar my index finger across the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
but I bar my index finger across the
high<00:01:43.619> e<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> you're

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
high e is what like this and you're

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.400 
high e is what like this and you're
going<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> need<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.960> able<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
going to need to be able to get your

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.160 
going to need to be able to get your
middle<00:01:49.619> finger<00:01:49.979> down<00:01:50.250> onto<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.060> B<00:01:51.570> string<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
middle finger down onto that B string a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.859 
middle finger down onto that B string a
half<00:01:52.920> step<00:01:53.160> higher<00:01:53.369> than<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.970> index<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.600> off

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
half step higher than your index and off

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
half step higher than your index and off
but<00:01:55.140> that's<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.710> those<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.550> two<00:01:56.700> shapes

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but that's that those are the two shapes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
but that's that those are the two shapes
so<00:01:57.300> check<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.570> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.219 

that<00:02:00.149> pull<00:02:01.079> step<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.860> Bard

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.089 

and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.700> we<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> little<00:02:11.440> picking<00:02:11.650> pattern

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
and then we do a little picking pattern

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.000 
and then we do a little picking pattern
I'm<00:02:12.580> going<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> break<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.060> down<00:02:13.120> for<00:02:13.569> you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

I<00:02:45.250> mean<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> Capo's<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> third<00:02:46.300> fret<00:02:46.660> but

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
I mean the Capo's on the third fret but

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.080 
I mean the Capo's on the third fret but
the<00:02:47.050> open<00:02:47.410> high<00:02:47.560> E<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.860> next<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.700> do<00:02:48.880> that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the open high E is next so I do that

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.390 
the open high E is next so I do that
shape<00:02:50.069> B<00:02:51.069> D<00:02:51.819> G<00:02:52.980> ie

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.819 

now<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.329> going<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.689> reverse<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.409> D<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.680> g

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
now we're going to reverse the D and g

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.460 
now we're going to reverse the D and g
strings<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.250> go<00:03:00.340> G<00:03:00.909> D<00:03:01.329> so<00:03:01.720> watch

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.880 

you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:23.960 

you<00:03:10.730> catch<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.200 

good<00:03:24.480> thing<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.750> practice<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.260> there

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.960 

and<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.260> there's<00:03:30.470> two<00:03:30.770> more<00:03:31.130> notes<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.760> then

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and then there's two more notes and then

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.150 
and then there's two more notes and then
the<00:03:32.090> sequel<00:03:32.450> sequence<00:03:33.020> repeats

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.830 

so<00:03:40.730> we<00:03:40.850> learned<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:41.240> far<00:03:41.270> now<00:03:41.570> we're<00:03:41.660> going<00:03:41.750> to

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
so we learned so far now we're going to

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.839 
so we learned so far now we're going to
add<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.110> high<00:03:42.260> e<00:03:42.290> again<00:03:42.710> and<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.910> G

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
add the high e again and the G

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.759 
add the high e again and the G
and<00:03:45.939> then<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.599> whole<00:03:46.749> thing<00:03:46.780> starts<00:03:47.079> over

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
and then the whole thing starts over

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.129 
and then the whole thing starts over
check<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.189> out<00:03:48.329> nothing<00:03:49.329> has<00:03:49.659> happened<00:03:49.689> with

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
check it out nothing has happened with

00:03:50.139 --> 00:04:07.880 
check it out nothing has happened with
my<00:03:50.260> left<00:03:50.469> hand

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.280 

if<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.760> look<00:04:09.000> at<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.240> sequence<00:04:09.660> only<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
if you look at the sequence only the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.340 
if you look at the sequence only the
first<00:04:10.710> note<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.180> sequence<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.170> B

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
first note of that sequence is on the B

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.370 
first note of that sequence is on the B
string<00:04:13.410> all<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.460> rest<00:04:14.810> your<00:04:15.810> middle<00:04:16.079> fingers

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
string all the rest your middle fingers

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.170 
string all the rest your middle fingers
go<00:04:16.530> into<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.890> high<00:04:17.100> except<00:04:17.820> for<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.000> very

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
go into that high except for the very

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.210 
go into that high except for the very
first<00:04:18.510> note<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> sequence

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.300 

see<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.000> only<00:04:24.270> one<00:04:24.480> time<00:04:24.990> did<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.040> hit<00:04:26.160> that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
see that only one time did I hit that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:35.600 
see that only one time did I hit that
b-string<00:04:26.700> look<00:04:26.910> again

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:51.770 

you

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.620 

boom<00:04:52.680> immediately<00:04:53.130> go<00:04:53.610> whole<00:04:53.820> step<00:04:54.060> down<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
boom immediately go whole step down and

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.040 
boom immediately go whole step down and
I'm<00:04:55.200> barring<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:56.360> but<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.450> pattern<00:04:57.810> starts

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
I'm barring that but the pattern starts

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.830 
I'm barring that but the pattern starts
the<00:04:58.110> same<00:04:58.290> way<00:04:58.350> B<00:04:59.190> D<00:04:59.970> G

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.549 

you

00:05:05.549 --> 00:05:05.559 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:20.010 

so<00:05:06.489> if<00:05:06.819> you<00:05:06.969> add<00:05:07.179> that

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.540 

followed<00:05:21.020> by<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.169> high<00:05:21.409> e<00:05:21.439> which<00:05:22.039> is<00:05:22.219> the<00:05:22.340> same

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
followed by the high e which is the same

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.160 
followed by the high e which is the same
as<00:05:22.729> well

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.080 

four<00:05:30.170> more<00:05:30.410> notes<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:31.280> are<00:05:31.670> a<00:05:31.700> different

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
four more notes that are a different

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.390 
four more notes that are a different
pattern<00:05:32.660> and<00:05:32.870> then<00:05:33.710> you've<00:05:33.890> got<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.250> whole

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
pattern and then you've got the whole

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.770 
pattern and then you've got the whole
sequence<00:05:34.760> so<00:05:35.180> start<00:05:35.510> from<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.690> beginning

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
sequence so start from the beginning

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:49.210 
sequence so start from the beginning
here<00:05:36.370> B<00:05:37.420> D<00:05:38.420> G<00:05:39.310> E<00:05:42.130> G<00:05:43.130> de<00:05:44.230> G<00:05:46.900> down<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:47.960> whole<00:05:48.230> step<00:05:48.350> B

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
here B D G E G de G down a whole step B

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.730 
here B D G E G de G down a whole step B
D<00:05:49.940> G<00:05:51.250> E

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.809 

I'm<00:05:55.740> going<00:05:55.889> to<00:05:55.949> put<00:05:56.069> our<00:05:56.160> middle<00:05:56.340> finger<00:05:56.669> down

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
I'm going to put our middle finger down

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.730 
I'm going to put our middle finger down
off<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.800> one<00:05:59.370> two<00:05:59.669> three<00:05:59.699> up<00:06:00.330> from<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.110> capo

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
off the one two three up from the capo

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.450 
off the one two three up from the capo
we're<00:06:02.550> still<00:06:02.759> playing<00:06:03.000> that<00:06:03.090> shape<00:06:03.479> though

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
we're still playing that shape though

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.400 
we're still playing that shape though
with<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.490> little<00:06:05.729> bar<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:07.050> we're<00:06:07.169> going<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.349> go

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
with a little bar and we're going to go

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.110 
with a little bar and we're going to go
like<00:06:07.530> this

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
like this

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.170 
like this

so<00:06:15.930> when<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.139> play<00:06:16.320> that<00:06:16.500> whole<00:06:16.710> sequence<00:06:17.190> it

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
so when you play that whole sequence it

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:42.080 
so when you play that whole sequence it
looks<00:06:17.460> like<00:06:17.580> this

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.000

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
see that so when that middle fingers

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:52.530 
see that so when that middle fingers
down<00:06:46.050> its<00:06:47.610> bgg<00:06:50.820> put<00:06:51.820> them<00:06:51.940> all<00:06:52.030> together<00:06:52.150> real

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
down its bgg put them all together real

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.879 
down its bgg put them all together real
