reason it says missing dll now there's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.389 
reason it says missing dll now there's
actually<00:01:50.759> no<00:01:50.970> missing<00:01:51.540> deal<00:01:51.780> there's<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
actually no missing deal there's just a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.620 
actually no missing deal there's just a
cache<00:01:53.909> file<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.560> license<00:01:56.009> file<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
cache file and the license file is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
cache file and the license file is
conflict<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.750> each<00:01:57.899> other<00:01:58.110> where<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.310> not

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
conflict with each other where it's not

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910

reading<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> game<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> guess<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.740> gives

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
reading the game I guess and it gives

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.850 
reading the game I guess and it gives
you<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.159> code<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you this code so the way to do this is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.540 
you this code so the way to do this is
multi<00:02:05.850> parts<00:02:06.590> I'm<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> pause<00:02:08.250> it

oh yeah okay I was gonna spare it um if
it<00:04:36.740> doesn't<00:04:37.130> work<00:04:37.310> from<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.450> first<00:04:38.720> fix<00:04:39.250> I'll

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
it doesn't work from the first fix I'll

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.620 
it doesn't work from the first fix I'll
show<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.670> second<00:04:41.030> way<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.150> doing<00:04:41.510> it

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
show you the second way of doing it

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.370 
show you the second way of doing it
which<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:43.480> another<00:04:44.480> file<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.960> have<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.110> check

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
which is another file you have to check

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.170 
which is another file you have to check
for<00:04:50.020> well<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.200> going<00:04:51.740> on<00:04:51.890> I'll<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.250> start

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
for well that's going on I'll just start

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.680 
for well that's going on I'll just start
on<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.450> second<00:04:53.810> part<00:04:54.940> it's<00:04:55.940> like<00:04:56.180> logging<00:04:56.420> in

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
on the second part it's like logging in

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.150 
on the second part it's like logging in
their<00:04:56.870> server<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.440> you're<00:05:00.680> gonna<00:05:00.800> have<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:01.040> go

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
their server so you're gonna have to go

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.700 
their server so you're gonna have to go
to<00:05:01.220> do<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:01.850> a/c<00:05:02.090> program<00:05:02.750> data<00:05:03.020> origin

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
to do this a/c program data origin

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:23.010 
to do this a/c program data origin
download<00:05:04.250> cash<00:05:04.520> or<00:05:05.510> cash<00:05:05.690> a

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.370 

so<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:23.860> gives<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.810> this<00:05:25.810> basically

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
so this gives you the this basically

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.320 
so this gives you the this basically
logs<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:26.979> everything<00:05:27.460> what<00:05:27.639> it's<00:05:27.819> doing<00:05:28.210> right

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
logs in everything what it's doing right

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.660 
logs in everything what it's doing right
now

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.879 

okay<00:05:34.670> as<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:35.030> was<00:05:35.060> saying<00:05:35.210> just<00:05:35.930> when<00:05:36.710> you're

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
okay as I was saying just when you're

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.320
