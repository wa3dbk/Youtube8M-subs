and we're going to show you some neat

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.200 
and we're going to show you some neat
features<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.790> Lawrence<00:00:09.559> structures<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
features of the Lawrence structures can

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.270 
features of the Lawrence structures can
the<00:00:12.210> lowrance<00:00:12.570> hds<00:00:12.750> models<00:00:13.620> allow<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.250> use

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the lowrance hds models allow you to use

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.800 
the lowrance hds models allow you to use
structure<00:00:14.880> scan<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:16.699> this<00:00:17.699> feature<00:00:18.029> allows

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
structure scan and this feature allows

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
structure scan and this feature allows
you<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.380> scan<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> bottom<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.340> lake<00:00:20.550> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
you to scan the bottom of the lake so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.810 
you to scan the bottom of the lake so
that<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.750> find<00:00:22.050> objects<00:00:22.590> here's<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> nice

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that you can find objects here's a nice

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.500 
that you can find objects here's a nice
picture<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.890> downs<00:00:25.890> cat<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:26.910> fish<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
picture of downs cat there's fish in the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
picture of downs cat there's fish in the
trees<00:00:27.840> there's<00:00:28.230> trees<00:00:28.470> without<00:00:28.830> fish<00:00:29.130> them

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
trees there's trees without fish them

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.490 
trees there's trees without fish them
they're<00:00:29.670> boulders<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.570> then<00:00:31.320> there's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
they're boulders and then there's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
they're boulders and then there's
fishing<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.040> drop<00:00:32.279> off<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.510> zoom<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
fishing to drop off if you zoom in you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.920 
fishing to drop off if you zoom in you
get<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> nice<00:00:35.070> view<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> tree<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.719> has

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
get a nice view of the tree that has

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
get a nice view of the tree that has
fish<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> tree<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.910> want

fish in it now that's the tree you want

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.490 
fish in it now that's the tree you want
to<00:00:39.420> fish<00:00:40.340> absolutely<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.210> also<00:00:42.500> find

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to fish absolutely you can also find

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
to fish absolutely you can also find
objects<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> bottom<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.120> here's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
up at my structure scan and I saw this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
up at my structure scan and I saw this
picture<00:01:36.650> well<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> wound<00:01:38.490> you

bottom because you can tell that the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.490 
bottom because you can tell that the
shadow<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:43.159> farther<00:01:44.159> away<00:01:44.310> from<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.570> white
