00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello friends of people beta mexico official 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:10.830
 and all the other vein groups today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.759
 I want to show you the way in which 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.470
 I take the amount for a strain of 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.380
 daphnia of the ones I send in my packages 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.720
 these organisms are very good because 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.769
 to achieve good development in 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 our fish 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.789
 here you get to see are many 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.290
 so what I do is with this little 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 colander let's take a few to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 then pack it in a bag 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.680
 with enough oxygen for them to arrive 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680
 alive 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.829
 This is a very good food. 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 Thai people use it more than 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 brine shrimp 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.490
 since it has 38% protein 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:14.580
 protein is the one that most occupy our 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 fish at the time of development 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.830
 as the requirement grows 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.990
 of protein is decreasing but 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.510
 imagine if we start to cultivate these 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.430
 At home we will have a very 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.830
 good and we will have to spend on 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.190
 commercial food since then this is 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.960
 what betas eat in nature 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.140
 here we see the amount here comes 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.930
 mixed both the flakes and the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.490
 apnea 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.590
 and with this amount is more than 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.020
 enough to start your cultivation 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.290
 you must have already prepared a bucket 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.480
 of at least 20 liters for 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.790
 with explored water to add 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.440
 the strain as soon as it reaches you 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.440
 Well, I leave the video 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.860
 the spinach there is in my channel if not 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.750
 I'll leave the link here goes to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 appear on the screen 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.319
 give click and automatically send them 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.109
