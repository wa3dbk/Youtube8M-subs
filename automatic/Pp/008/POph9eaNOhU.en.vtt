00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.920 
way I can just throw it away and done
and<00:02:37.020> then<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.680> cover<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.720> deep

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and then you just cover it here deep

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.830 
and then you just cover it here deep
cover<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.100> place<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> stove<00:02:41.840> you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
cover and you place it on the stove you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.140 
cover and you place it on the stove you
bring<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.350> boil<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.490> once<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.880> starts

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
bring it to a boil and once it starts

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180 
bring it to a boil and once it starts
boiling<00:02:45.210> then<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.230> lower<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> simmer

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
boiling then you lower it to a simmer

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.970 
boiling then you lower it to a simmer
and<00:02:47.700> just<00:02:48.240> simmer<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.780> about<00:02:48.870> 45<00:02:49.230> minutes<00:02:49.740> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
and just simmer for about 45 minutes to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.490 
and just simmer for about 45 minutes to
an<00:02:50.100> hour<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.570> only<00:02:51.690> takes<00:02:51.960> about<00:02:52.080> an<00:02:52.440> hour

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
an hour so it only takes about an hour

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.980 
an hour so it only takes about an hour
total<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.610> them<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.000> cooked<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.600> should<00:02:54.870> be

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
total for them to be cooked it should be

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.630 
total for them to be cooked it should be
probably<00:02:55.620> no<00:02:55.740> more<00:02:55.770> than<00:02:55.980> hour<00:02:56.310> know

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
probably no more than hour know
