incentive for manufacturers to create

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.709 
incentive for manufacturers to create
products<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.759> designed<00:02:06.509> for

I<00:02:12.200> think<00:02:12.590> we're<00:02:12.770> gonna<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.130> trouble<00:02:13.280> we

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
I think we're gonna be in trouble we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.880 
I think we're gonna be in trouble we

we<00:02:29.930> don't<00:02:30.020> have<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.650> at<00:02:31.070> here<00:02:31.550> because<00:02:31.970> we

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we don't have that at here because we

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.360 
we don't have that at here because we
have<00:02:32.360> no<00:02:32.630> national<00:02:32.900> policy<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.100> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
have no national policy on this and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.010 
have no national policy on this and
we've<00:02:34.610> farmed<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.209> out<00:02:35.330> all<00:02:35.570> over<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.930> world

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
we've farmed it out all over the world

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.990 
we've farmed it out all over the world
because<00:02:36.350> they<00:02:37.070> were<00:02:37.100> gonna<00:02:37.280> do<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.550> cheap<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
because they were gonna do it cheap and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.430 
because they were gonna do it cheap and
then<00:02:38.180> we<00:02:38.600> don't<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.930> worry<00:02:39.080> about<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
then we don't have to worry about it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.930 
then we don't have to worry about it
because<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:40.010> really<00:02:40.250> don't<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.700> mess

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
because we really don't want this mess

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.880 
because we really don't want this mess
and<00:02:41.120> meanwhile<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:42.020> are<00:02:42.050> buying<00:02:42.530> more<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
and meanwhile we are buying more and

more and more and more of this stuff in

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380 
more and more and more of this stuff in

recycling less and less the trend from
2000<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.380> 2010<00:02:48.950> has<00:02:49.130> been<00:02:49.160> like<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.150> that's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
2000 to 2010 has been like this that's

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.360 
2000 to 2010 has been like this that's
not<00:02:50.660> good<00:02:50.900> recycling<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.440> great<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.250> a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
not good recycling is great it's a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.979 
not good recycling is great it's a
wonderful<00:02:52.820> thing<00:02:52.970> don't<00:02:53.300> get<00:02:53.390> me<00:02:53.510> wrong<00:02:53.540> like

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
wonderful thing don't get me wrong like

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.220 
wonderful thing don't get me wrong like
I'm<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.500> huge<00:02:55.190> fan<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:56.330> it's<00:02:56.630> really<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:57.050> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
I'm a huge fan but it's really at the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.949 
I'm a huge fan but it's really at the
end<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> life<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.450> want<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.840> have

the environment you have to start at the

reduce reuse recycle well that is the

reduce reuse recycle well that is the
order<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.420> which<00:03:11.720> you're<00:03:11.989> gonna<00:03:12.140> be<00:03:12.320> able<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
order in which you're gonna be able to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.280 
order in which you're gonna be able to
impact<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.280> environment<00:03:13.880> by<00:03:14.090> not<00:03:14.290> creating

impact the environment by not creating

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.069 
impact the environment by not creating
something<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> first<00:03:16.130> place<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:17.269> get<00:03:17.870> rid

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
something in the first place you get rid

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.360 
something in the first place you get rid
of<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.230> hundred<00:03:18.470> percent<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.980> emissions

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
of a hundred percent of the emissions

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.900 
of a hundred percent of the emissions
once<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.940> became<00:03:20.660> interested<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.100> look

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
once I became interested in this I look

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.720 
once I became interested in this I look
at<00:03:23.470> everything<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.799> buy<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.280> different<00:03:25.640> way

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
at everything I buy in a different way

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.580 
at everything I buy in a different way
and<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.630> think<00:03:26.660> that's<00:03:26.900> where<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.200> starts

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
and I think that's where it starts

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.470 
and I think that's where it starts
that's<00:03:27.739> where<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.100> paradigm<00:03:28.549> shift<00:03:28.579> occurs

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
that's where the paradigm shift occurs

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.770 
that's where the paradigm shift occurs
is<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.440> look<00:03:30.680> at<00:03:30.860> everything

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
is if you can look at everything

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.120 
is if you can look at everything
slightly<00:03:32.780> differently<00:03:33.200> from<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.950> way<00:03:34.070> you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
slightly differently from the way you

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.039 
slightly differently from the way you
did<00:03:34.370> before<00:03:34.519> do<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.870> latest

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
did before do I have to have the latest

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.699 
did before do I have to have the latest
model<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:37.040> car<00:03:37.880> for<00:03:38.329> example<00:03:38.420> or<00:03:38.959> can<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.380> keep

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
model of car for example or can I keep

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.770 
model of car for example or can I keep
running<00:03:40.190> my<00:03:40.370> old<00:03:40.640> beater<00:03:40.910> for<00:03:41.030> another<00:03:41.510> couple
