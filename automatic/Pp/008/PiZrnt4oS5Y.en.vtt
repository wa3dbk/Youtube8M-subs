00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.050 
looks like the weft is very very thick
so<00:05:18.719> it's<00:05:19.319> easy<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.710> clip<00:05:19.919> one<00:05:20.129> and<00:05:20.400> then<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.819> club

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
so it's easy to clip one and then a club

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.689 
so it's easy to clip one and then a club
looks<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.569> like<00:05:21.719> that<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:23.400> then<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.550> just

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
looks just like that and then you just

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.219 
looks just like that and then you just
snap<00:05:23.909> into<00:05:24.090> your<00:05:24.300> hair<00:05:24.449> and<00:05:24.810> how<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.050> this

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
snap into your hair and how is this

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.080 
snap into your hair and how is this
different<00:05:25.500> from<00:05:25.680> other<00:05:25.949> clippings<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.669> guess<00:05:26.909> I

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
different from other clippings I guess I

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.899 
different from other clippings I guess I
look<00:05:27.270> for<00:05:27.569> um<00:05:27.900> they're<00:05:28.889> very<00:05:29.129> high<00:05:29.370> quality

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
look for um they're very high quality

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.110 
look for um they're very high quality
they're<00:05:30.539> very<00:05:30.860> smooth<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.460> texture<00:05:33.089> is

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
they're very smooth and the texture is

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.320 
they're very smooth and the texture is
very<00:05:33.180> nice<00:05:33.629> and<00:05:34.620> soft<00:05:34.949> it's<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.669> advantage<00:05:36.120> of

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
very nice and soft it's the advantage of

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.110 
very nice and soft it's the advantage of
having<00:05:36.659> clips<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:38.129> advantage<00:05:38.789> of<00:05:38.940> having

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
having clips the advantage of having

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.409 
having clips the advantage of having
clip<00:05:39.539> ins<00:05:39.779> would<00:05:40.259> probably<00:05:40.560> have<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.710> be<00:05:41.419> um

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
clip ins would probably have to be um

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.269 
clip ins would probably have to be um
you<00:05:42.839> can<00:05:42.990> take<00:05:43.169> them<00:05:43.259> out<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.650> take<00:05:43.919> him<00:05:44.039> put

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
you can take them out and take him put

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.040 
you can take them out and take him put
him<00:05:44.370> back<00:05:44.460> in<00:05:44.669> whenever<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.330> want<00:05:45.539> so<00:05:45.930> the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
him back in whenever you want so the

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.600 
him back in whenever you want so the
advantage<00:05:46.259> is<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.620> don't<00:05:46.919> have<00:05:47.069> you<00:05:47.339> can<00:05:47.490> do

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
advantage is you don't have you can do

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.910 
advantage is you don't have you can do
this<00:05:47.729> yourself<00:05:48.180> first<00:05:48.449> of<00:05:48.629> all
