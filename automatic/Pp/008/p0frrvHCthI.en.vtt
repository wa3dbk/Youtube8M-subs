00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
lifeproof cases now I have to say that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
lifeproof cases now I have to say that
both<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.820> cases<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.829> good

both these cases they are very very good
cases<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.000> had<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> pick<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.050> would

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
cases but if we had to pick one it would

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
cases but if we had to pick one it would
have<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> lifeproof<00:00:53.160> nuud<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.420> the

weight<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.470> bulk<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.979> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> ease

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
weight in the bulk we look at the ease

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.130 
weight in the bulk we look at the ease
of<00:01:44.430> installation<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> build

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
of installation and we look at the build

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
of installation and we look at the build
quality<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.740> terms<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.310> weight<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.670> bulk<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
quality in terms of weight and bulk the

quality in terms of weight and bulk the
nude<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.930> heavier<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
nude is a little heavier and it's a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.109 
nude is a little heavier and it's a
little<00:01:50.130> thicker<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
little thicker but you don't really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.429 
little thicker but you don't really
notice<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> thickness<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:52.290> you're

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
notice that thickness because you're

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
notice that thickness because you're
constantly<00:01:52.710> using<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.250> iPhone<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
constantly using your iPhone kind of in

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.819 
constantly using your iPhone kind of in
the<00:01:54.420> middle<00:01:54.570> through<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> thinnest<00:01:55.290> part<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the middle through the thinnest part and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
the middle through the thinnest part and
at<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.369> point<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.790> think<00:01:56.850> both<00:01:57.149> cases<00:01:57.450> are

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
at that point I think both cases are

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
at that point I think both cases are
both<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> thick<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.680> terms<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> ease<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
both as thick in terms of the ease of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.969 
both as thick in terms of the ease of
insulation<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.509> they're<00:02:01.110> exactly<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> same

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
insulation you they're exactly the same

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.620 
insulation you they're exactly the same
you<00:02:02.189> undo<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> Lightning<00:02:03.030> port<00:02:03.180> latch<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
you undo the Lightning port latch and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
you undo the Lightning port latch and
then<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> pull<00:02:04.229> everything<00:02:04.500> apart<00:02:04.710> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
then you pull everything apart really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
then you pull everything apart really
easy<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.299> build<00:02:06.570> quality<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.619> give

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
easy for build quality we have to give

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
easy for build quality we have to give
that<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> lifeproof<00:02:08.520> nuud<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.840> feels

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that to the lifeproof nuud this feels

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.760 
that to the lifeproof nuud this feels
like<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.770> solid<00:02:11.550> case<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.270> most

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
like a very solid case and most

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.290 
like a very solid case and most
because<00:02:13.100> well<00:02:13.490> there's<00:02:13.820> no<00:02:13.970> screen<00:02:14.270> protector

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
because well there's no screen protector

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.030 
because well there's no screen protector
so<00:02:14.810> everything<00:02:15.110> needs<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.470> much<00:02:15.680> tougher

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
so everything needs to be much tougher

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070 
so everything needs to be much tougher
now<00:02:16.760> if<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.970> want<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.240> know<00:02:17.330> more<00:02:17.660> about<00:02:17.690> these

a<00:02:32.750> slap<00:02:33.020> drop<00:02:33.260> which<00:02:33.500> revolved<00:02:34.010> me<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
a slap drop which revolved me and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.320 
a slap drop which revolved me and
throwing<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.760> up<00:02:34.820> in<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> air<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.240> then

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
throwing it up in the air and then

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
throwing it up in the air and then

the<00:02:37.280> lifeproof<00:02:37.640> fre<00:02:37.700> spent<00:02:38.240> some<00:02:38.450> time<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.990> the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
the lifeproof fre spent some time at the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.300 
the lifeproof fre spent some time at the
bottle<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.470> swimming<00:02:39.770> pool<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
bottle in the swimming pool and the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.940 
bottle in the swimming pool and the
lifeproof<00:02:40.610> nuud<00:02:41.180> well<00:02:41.540> went<00:02:41.900> drinking<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.770> did

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
lifeproof nuud well went drinking we did

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.160 
lifeproof nuud well went drinking we did
a<00:02:43.130> beer<00:02:43.460> test<00:02:43.760> with<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> lifeproof<00:02:44.780> nuud<00:02:45.020> to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
a beer test with the lifeproof nuud to

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.770 
a beer test with the lifeproof nuud to
see<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.710> was<00:02:45.860> beer<00:02:46.100> proof<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:47.060> was<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
see if it was beer proof and it was and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.180 
see if it was beer proof and it was and
I<00:02:48.200> think<00:02:48.380> that's<00:02:48.530> probably<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.860> more<00:02:49.010> realistic

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
I think that's probably a more realistic

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.220 
I think that's probably a more realistic
test<00:02:49.700> given<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.240> well<00:02:50.780> we're<00:02:50.990> probably

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
test given that well we're probably

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.080 
test given that well we're probably
gonna<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.740> drinking<00:02:52.250> with<00:02:52.310> our<00:02:52.580> phones<00:02:52.820> rather

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
gonna go drinking with our phones rather

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.930 
gonna go drinking with our phones rather
than<00:02:53.360> doing<00:02:53.630> water<00:02:53.990> sports<00:02:54.110> that's<00:02:54.800> my<00:02:55.640> guess

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
than doing water sports that's my guess

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.870 
than doing water sports that's my guess
anyways<00:02:56.480> now<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.680> as<00:02:57.830> an<00:02:58.010> observation<00:02:58.190> and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
anyways now just as an observation and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.070 
anyways now just as an observation and
this<00:02:59.000> didn't<00:02:59.300> happen<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.660> us<00:02:59.780> when<00:02:59.930> we're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
this didn't happen to us when we're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.810 
this didn't happen to us when we're
doing<00:03:00.170> our<00:03:00.320> test<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:00.920> there<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.520> another

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
doing our test is that there is another

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.120 
doing our test is that there is another
seal<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.960> lifeproof<00:03:03.350> new<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.770> there's<00:03:03.920> two

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
seal on the lifeproof new so there's two

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.770 
seal on the lifeproof new so there's two
seals<00:03:04.460> which<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:04.940> basically<00:03:05.150> twice<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:05.660> many

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
seals which is basically twice as many

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080 
seals which is basically twice as many
on<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.470> lifeproof<00:03:06.650> fre<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.790> chance

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
on the lifeproof fre and so the chance

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.570 
on the lifeproof fre and so the chance
of<00:03:08.270> something<00:03:08.540> happening<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
of something happening to the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.790 
of something happening to the
waterproofing<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.600> nude<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.990> much<00:03:12.500> higher

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
waterproofing of the nude is much higher

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.530 
waterproofing of the nude is much higher
because<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.550> debris<00:03:13.910> between<00:03:14.210> your

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
because if you get debris between your

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.900 
because if you get debris between your
case<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.140> o-ring<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.310> lifeproof

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
case and the o-ring of the lifeproof

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.640 
case and the o-ring of the lifeproof
nuud<00:03:17.330> well<00:03:17.540> it's<00:03:17.690> not<00:03:17.810> waterproof<00:03:18.110> anymore<00:03:18.560> so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
nuud well it's not waterproof anymore so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.220 
nuud well it's not waterproof anymore so
that's<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.010> something<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> keep<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.820> mind

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
that's just something to keep in mind

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.270 
that's just something to keep in mind
always<00:03:21.230> keep<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.620> o-rings<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.160> your

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
about a quarter of an inch so it does

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.320 
about a quarter of an inch so it does

to put it facedown that's not a lot of

to put it facedown that's not a lot of
extra<00:03:37.820> protection<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.420> it's<00:03:38.570> better<00:03:38.780> than

extra protection but it's better than

these cases well the biggest thing for

these cases well the biggest thing for
us<00:04:05.990> was<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.620> hole<00:04:06.800> for<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.100> two-tone<00:04:07.430> flash

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
usability well it goes to the case that

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.789 
usability well it goes to the case that
doesn't<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.810> any<00:04:20.960> screen<00:04:21.380> protection

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
actually probably one of the better

cases for screen usability because the

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.800 
cases for screen usability because the
