change<00:00:57.329> you'll<00:00:58.260> notice<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.710> off<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.250> bat

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
change you'll notice right off the bat

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.870 
change you'll notice right off the bat
for<00:00:59.700> 2013<00:01:00.630> is<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.320> nose<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.890> has<00:01:02.340> completely

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
for 2013 is the nose it has completely

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.690 
for 2013 is the nose it has completely
been<00:01:03.630> rounded<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.559> blunted<00:01:05.070> definitely

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
been rounded off not blunted definitely

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
been rounded off not blunted definitely
don't<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> word<00:01:06.509> but<00:01:07.079> you'll<00:01:07.259> notice

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
don't use that word but you'll notice

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
don't use that word but you'll notice
that<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> contact<00:01:08.250> point<00:01:08.490> hits<00:01:08.759> it<00:01:09.570> rolls<00:01:09.990> up

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that the contact point hits it rolls up

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.749 
that the contact point hits it rolls up
and<00:01:10.469> then<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:10.829> slightly<00:01:11.250> rolls

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
and then it actually slightly rolls

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.120 
and then it actually slightly rolls
again<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.479> initially<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.079> too<00:01:13.350> little

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
again so you initially have too little

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.600 
again so you initially have too little
contact<00:01:14.729> points<00:01:15.149> right<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.049> ok<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:17.340> as

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
contact points right here ok now as

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.309 
contact points right here ok now as
you're<00:01:17.819> riding<00:01:17.999> through<00:01:18.359> powder<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:19.170> on

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
you're riding through powder even on

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.910 
you're riding through powder even on

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
to surf through that the powder actually

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.069 
to surf through that the powder actually
comes<00:01:26.039> up<00:01:26.249> over<00:01:26.490> top<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.420> actually

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
comes up over top of this and actually

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.870 
comes up over top of this and actually
rolls<00:01:28.439> almost<00:01:28.889> like<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.039> wave<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.670> pretty

over and kind of displace it keeps the
nose<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.279> really<00:01:41.549> keeps<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.909> floating

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
nose up and really keeps you floating

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.539 
nose up and really keeps you floating
through<00:01:42.630> everything<00:01:42.929> it's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:44.069> amazing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
through everything it's a really amazing

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.910 
through everything it's a really amazing
feeling<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.689> top<00:01:45.959> of<00:01:46.109> that<00:01:46.229> you'll<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.799> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
feeling and on top of that you'll see on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.279 
feeling and on top of that you'll see on
the<00:01:47.039> tail<00:01:47.279> it's<00:01:47.939> rounded<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.569> as<00:01:48.749> well<00:01:48.959> and

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
the tail it's rounded out as well and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.879 
the tail it's rounded out as well and
this<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.789> helps<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.209> sink<00:01:51.719> down<00:01:52.020> into

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:52.889 
this actually helps you sink down into

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:54.199 
this actually helps you sink down into
the<00:01:53.130> snow<00:01:53.189> slightly<00:01:53.849> I<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:54.090> definitely

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
the snow slightly I could definitely

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.629 
the snow slightly I could definitely
tell<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:54.630> difference<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.829> nose<00:01:56.039> keeps<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.490> up

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
tell a difference the nose keeps you up

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.190 
tell a difference the nose keeps you up
the<00:01:56.849> tail<00:01:57.029> keeps<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> down<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.169> don't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the tail keeps you down but you don't

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.889 
the tail keeps you down but you don't
bottom<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.950> there's<00:01:59.249> enough<00:01:59.520> float<00:01:59.999> as<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
bottom out there's enough float as you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
bottom out there's enough float as you
come<00:02:01.139> through<00:02:01.169> the<00:02:01.529> powder<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.919> if<00:02:02.490> you're

in<00:02:02.789> as<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.209> 8<00:02:03.479> inches<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.959> can<00:02:04.049> cruise

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
in as little as 8 inches you can cruise

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.889 
in as little as 8 inches you can cruise
across<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> top<00:02:05.039> six<00:02:05.399> inches<00:02:05.639> and<00:02:05.999> not<00:02:06.599> feel

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899

the<00:02:07.079> bottom<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.590> an<00:02:07.799> incredible

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the bottom which is an incredible

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
the bottom which is an incredible
feeling<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.569> big<00:02:09.840> change<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.860> pop

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
feeling the other big change is the pop

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.610 
feeling the other big change is the pop
rods<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.489> gone<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.970> 2012<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.290> were<00:02:13.380> pop

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
rods are gone in 2012 there were pop

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.530 
rods are gone in 2012 there were pop
rods<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> tail<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.420> no

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
rods here and in the tail there are no

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.380 
rods here and in the tail there are no
longer<00:02:15.780> any<00:02:16.110> pop<00:02:16.470> rods<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> nose<00:02:17.250> it's<00:02:18.239> got

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
longer any pop rods in the nose it's got

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
longer any pop rods in the nose it's got
a<00:02:18.420> much<00:02:18.630> softer<00:02:19.110> nose<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.739> as<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.340> hit<00:02:20.520> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
a much softer nose so as you hit the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.150 
a much softer nose so as you hit the
powder<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.450> hit<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> chop<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.740> softer

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
powder and you hit the chop the softer

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.070 
powder and you hit the chop the softer
nose<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.550> actually<00:02:23.820> feel<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.360> as<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.900> hit

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
nose you can actually feel it as you hit

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.309 
nose you can actually feel it as you hit
the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.410 
the
snow<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:26.159> helps<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.489> adjust<00:02:26.609> especially

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
snow and it helps you adjust especially

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.449 
snow and it helps you adjust especially
when<00:02:27.540> you're<00:02:27.659> going<00:02:27.959> through<00:02:28.260> through<00:02:29.159> crud

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
when you're going through through crud

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
when you're going through through crud
because<00:02:29.969> what<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.329> going<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.719> for<00:02:30.749> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
because what that's going to do for you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.589 
because what that's going to do for you
is<00:02:31.319> you're<00:02:32.129> not<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.700> gonna<00:02:32.879> push<00:02:33.120> through<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
is you're not it's gonna push through it

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.000 
is you're not it's gonna push through it
and<00:02:33.719> soften<00:02:34.379> up<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.829> can<00:02:34.980> make

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and soften up so you can make

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.589 
and soften up so you can make
adjustments<00:02:35.639> faster<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.239> don't<00:02:36.329> end<00:02:36.510> up

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
adjustments faster and you don't end up

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.089 
adjustments faster and you don't end up
on<00:02:36.719> your<00:02:36.870> ass<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.499> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> snow<00:02:37.829> then

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
on your ass and you in the snow then

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.520 
on your ass and you in the snow then
trying<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.430> roll<00:02:39.329> over<00:02:39.359> and<00:02:39.749> get<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.319> through

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
trying to roll over and get up through

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.319 
trying to roll over and get up through
all<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.829> powder<00:02:41.099> which<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.579> huge<00:02:41.849> thing

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
all that powder which is a huge thing

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.170 
all that powder which is a huge thing
but<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.170> biggest<00:02:43.379> change<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.120> know

you'll go heel side or toe side edge to

3/4<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:31.079> board<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.620> makes<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.370> huge

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
3/4 of your board it makes a huge

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.460 
3/4 of your board it makes a huge
difference<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.329> being<00:03:33.540> able<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.930> pop<00:03:34.229> get

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
difference in being able to get pop get

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.869 
difference in being able to get pop get
enough<00:03:34.680> air<00:03:34.949> and<00:03:35.099> get<00:03:35.220> those<00:03:35.370> spins<00:03:35.729> around

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
enough air and get those spins around

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.879 
enough air and get those spins around
and<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.720> other<00:03:36.870> big<00:03:37.079> thing<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.530> really

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
and the other big thing that I really

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.589 
and the other big thing that I really
love<00:03:38.099> about<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.549> is<00:03:38.669> it<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.030> accelerates

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
love about it is it actually accelerates

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.960 
love about it is it actually accelerates
your<00:03:40.049> turns<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.620> accelerates<00:03:41.189> your<00:03:41.310> spins<00:03:41.729> as

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
your turns and accelerates your spins as

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.149 
your turns and accelerates your spins as
you're<00:03:42.569> carving<00:03:43.079> when<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.439> get<00:03:43.680> through<00:03:44.009> and

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
you're carving when you get through and

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.429 
you're carving when you get through and
the<00:03:44.250> energy<00:03:44.669> hits<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.629> part<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.199> it

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
the energy hits that part of it it

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.349 
the energy hits that part of it it
speeds<00:03:46.799> up<00:03:46.949> your<00:03:47.009> turn<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.729> when<00:03:48.209> you're

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
speeds up your turn and when you're

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.259 
speeds up your turn and when you're
coming<00:03:48.629> through<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.349> spin<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.400> lasts<00:03:51.060> you

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
coming through on a spin that lasts you

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.969 
coming through on a spin that lasts you
know<00:03:51.299> little<00:03:51.689> section<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.259> your<00:03:52.470> deck<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
know little section of your deck it

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.830 
know little section of your deck it
allows<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.699> accelerate<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.540> get<00:03:54.659> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
allows you to accelerate and get you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.599 
allows you to accelerate and get you
around<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.259> much<00:03:55.470> faster<00:03:55.739> there's<00:03:56.400> been

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
around that much faster there's been

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.460 
around that much faster there's been
three<00:03:56.819> or<00:03:56.909> four<00:03:56.939> situations<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.290> snow

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
three or four situations with the snow

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.289 
three or four situations with the snow
conditions<00:03:58.949> this<00:03:59.129> year<00:03:59.189> that<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.150> know<00:04:00.269> I

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
conditions this year that you know I

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.569 
conditions this year that you know I
just<00:04:00.479> didn't<00:04:00.900> get<00:04:00.989> enough<00:04:01.109> air<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.280> needed

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
just didn't get enough air and I needed

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.369 
just didn't get enough air and I needed
that<00:04:02.759> much<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.329> more<00:04:03.509> and<00:04:03.780> these<00:04:03.989> gave<00:04:04.229> me

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
that much little more and these gave me

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.469 
that much little more and these gave me
enough<00:04:04.769> energy<00:04:05.370> through<00:04:05.699> the<00:04:05.849> spin<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.269> land

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
enough energy through the spin to land

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.149 
enough energy through the spin to land
that<00:04:06.689> five<00:04:07.019> I'll<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:07.409> that<00:04:07.620> three<00:04:07.889> rather

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
that five I'll and that three rather

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.420 
that five I'll and that three rather
than<00:04:08.459> land<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.180> 270<00:04:09.930> edged<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.409> and<00:04:10.620> eat<00:04:11.040> so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
than land a 270 edged in and eat so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.390 
than land a 270 edged in and eat so
it's<00:04:11.969> a<00:04:12.120> huge<00:04:12.389> change<00:04:12.889> that's<00:04:13.889> really

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
it's a huge change that's really

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.219 
it's a huge change that's really
beneficial<00:04:14.759> I<00:04:15.030> think<00:04:15.060> all<00:04:15.449> of<00:04:15.509> you<00:04:15.870> guys<00:04:16.019> are
