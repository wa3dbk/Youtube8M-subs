 witnesses of the story definitely 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.930
 We believe that this has been one of the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.990
 Brightest performances in the classic 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:48.250
 of the Caribbean because with this track this 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.740
 150 and 13 shows that we have seen two 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.090
 of the best native horses in the area 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.820
 in this race I omit and not only the 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.560
 rider cup the cup fellowship and the 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.140
 classic of the Caribbean but his coach 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.150
 Alberto steps Rodriguez who passed him 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.820
 yesterday at the trophy delivery here in the

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.760
 also troupe and has been a consistent 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.920
 participant in these conflicts and I'm not 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.950
 totally safe but I think it 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.470
 becomes the ultimate winner as 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.230
 in the story I think it is now 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:27.120
 tie so much with Alberto Cepeda from 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.120
 mexico for this position
