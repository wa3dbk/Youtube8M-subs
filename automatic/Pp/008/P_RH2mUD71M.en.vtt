waterfall braid today I'm going to show

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.610 
waterfall braid today I'm going to show
you<00:00:08.550> three<00:00:09.030> different<00:00:09.200> variations<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.320> this

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
you three different variations to this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.829

look<00:00:13.280> start<00:00:14.280> off<00:00:14.460> by<00:00:14.700> taking<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.179> piece<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.389> hair

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
look start off by taking a piece of hair

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
look start off by taking a piece of hair
and<00:00:15.870> divide<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.619> sections<00:00:17.130> take<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and divide it into sections take the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.849 
and divide it into sections take the
outer<00:00:18.090> section<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> cross<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.500> over<00:00:19.619> the

inner<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.580> take<00:00:21.270> another<00:00:21.570> section<00:00:21.960> cross<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
inner one take another section cross it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.929 
inner one take another section cross it
over<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.760> under<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.960> leave<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.070> out<00:00:26.310> cross

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939

this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> first<00:01:20.850> variation<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.950> seems

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this is the first variation it seems

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
this is the first variation it seems
complicated<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.049> see

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
complicated at first but you will see

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.929 
complicated at first but you will see
that<00:01:25.530> once<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> hang<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> it's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that once you got the hang of it it's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.230 
that once you got the hang of it it's
very<00:01:27.060> simple<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.579> let's<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.790> into<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
very simple to do let's get into the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
very simple to do let's get into the
second<00:01:30.689> look<00:01:30.900> take<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> piece<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> hair<00:01:32.189> divide

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
second look take a piece of hair divide

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
second look take a piece of hair divide
it<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:32.850> sections<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> regular

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it in three sections and do a regular

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.770 
it in three sections and do a regular
braid<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> first<00:01:35.640> crossing<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
braid for the first crossing then add a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.929 
braid for the first crossing then add a
piece<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> hair<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> center<00:01:38.250> part<00:01:38.490> take

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
piece of hair to the center part take

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
piece of hair to the center part take
the<00:01:39.119> outer<00:01:39.270> section<00:01:39.720> divided<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the outer section divided in two and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
the outer section divided in two and
leave<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> piece<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.610> cross<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.479> sections

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
leave a piece out cross your sections

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
leave a piece out cross your sections
add<00:01:43.320> hair<00:01:43.890> divide<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:44.759> outer<00:01:45.000> section<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
add hair divide your outer section in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
add hair divide your outer section in
two<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> leave<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> piece<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.130> notice<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
two and leave a piece out notice that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.330 
two and leave a piece out notice that
every<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.869> divide<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.350> section<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> outer

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
every time I divide my section the outer

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
every time I divide my section the outer
piece<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.390> add<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> braid

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
piece is the one that I add to the braid

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
piece is the one that I add to the braid
I<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.369> way<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.850> looks<00:01:54.119> more

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I think that this way it looks more

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230 
I think that this way it looks more
polished<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.500> two<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.100> three<00:01:56.399> more<00:01:56.640> crossings

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
polished do two or three more crossings

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.550 
polished do two or three more crossings
until<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.810> reach<00:01:58.079> your<00:01:58.110> ear<00:01:58.560> level

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.670 

at<00:02:03.560> your<00:02:03.890> last<00:02:04.220> section<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.760> hair<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:06.290> use

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
at your last section of hair and now use

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.710 
at your last section of hair and now use
