metal<00:00:16.500> zone<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.430> how<00:00:17.610> shet<00:00:17.910> this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
metal zone we all know how shet this

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.019 
metal zone we all know how shet this
pedal<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.289> let's<00:00:19.529> make<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.770> better<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
pedal is so let's make it better if you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.150 
pedal is so let's make it better if you
look<00:00:21.210> online<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.630> find<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> few<00:00:22.050> different

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
look online you find a few different

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.679 
look online you find a few different
modifications<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> metal<00:00:24.029> zone<00:00:24.179> today

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
modifications for the metal zone today

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
modifications for the metal zone today
I'm<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.650> one<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.189> diesel

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I'm going to do one that's the diesel

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.489 
I'm going to do one that's the diesel
Lord<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.089> these<00:00:27.390> alone<00:00:27.689> diesel<00:00:28.080> amps<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
Lord that's these alone diesel amps I

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.200 
Lord that's these alone diesel amps I
assume<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.429> makes<00:00:29.669> it<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:29.939> more

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
assume it's because it makes it so more

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
assume it's because it makes it so more
like<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.419> diesel<00:00:30.839> lamp<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:32.160> there's

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
like a diesel lamp I'm not sure there's

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.760 
like a diesel lamp I'm not sure there's
almost<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> Keeley<00:00:33.360> mode<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.690> well<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
almost a Keeley mode as well and a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.470 
almost a Keeley mode as well and a
couple<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.160> others<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.670> you'd<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> fall

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
couple of others so you'd have to fall

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880 
couple of others so you'd have to fall
this<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.810> if<00:00:36.900> you<00:00:36.960> don't<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.379> one<00:00:37.590> but

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this one if you don't want this one but

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
this one if you don't want this one but
I'm<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.789> diesel<00:00:39.059> mode<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I'm going to the diesel mode for this

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
I'm going to the diesel mode for this
today<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.620> elements<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.160> we're<00:00:41.280> changing

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
today the elements that we're changing

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
today the elements that we're changing
for<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.940> diesel<00:00:42.180> mod<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.870> reduce<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
for this diesel mod will reduce the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
for this diesel mod will reduce the
harshness<00:00:43.859> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> pedal<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.210> fellow

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
harshness of the pedal it will fellow

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.319 
harshness of the pedal it will fellow
dynamic<00:00:46.140> range<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> bit<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.859> and<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> EQ

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
dynamic range a bit more and make the EQ

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.590 
dynamic range a bit more and make the EQ
a<00:00:48.359> bit<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.989> usable<00:00:49.590> than<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.980> before

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
a bit more usable than it was before

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.540 
a bit more usable than it was before

change<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.380> 1n<00:02:01.860> 400<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:03.000> diode<00:02:03.690> which

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
change that to a 1n 400 for diode which

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
change that to a 1n 400 for diode which
is<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.110> quite<00:02:04.290> common<00:02:04.590> diodes<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.220> should<00:02:05.340> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
is a quite common diodes it should have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.650 
is a quite common diodes it should have
no<00:02:05.610> problem<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.120> hold<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> those

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
no problem going to hold one of those

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.990 
no problem going to hold one of those
and<00:02:07.020> diode<00:02:07.710> three<00:02:07.950> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> change<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> stand

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and diode three want to change to stand

and diode three want to change to stand
up<00:02:09.179> LED<00:02:09.780> output<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.560> using<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.160> LED<00:02:11.700> from

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
up LED output will be using the LED from

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.610 
up LED output will be using the LED from
the<00:02:12.060> indicator<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.840> pedal<00:02:13.290> since<00:02:13.439> I'll<00:02:13.590> be

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the indicator on the pedal since I'll be

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.160 
the indicator on the pedal since I'll be
changing<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.549> indicator<00:02:14.939> led<00:02:15.359> to<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> super

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
changing the indicator led to a super

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:32.800 
changing the indicator led to a super
bright<00:02:16.379> orange<00:02:16.799> one

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.930 

so<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> completely<00:02:34.250> diesel<00:02:34.760> mode

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
so this is the completely diesel mode

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.380 
so this is the completely diesel mode

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
circuit board here you can see I've got

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.620 
circuit board here you can see I've got
my<00:02:38.450> new<00:02:38.840> capacitors<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:41.060> here

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
my new capacitors on here and then here

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.410 
my new capacitors on here and then here
and<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.560> replacement<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.910> other<00:02:44.150> swap

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
and the replacement one the other swap

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.910 
and the replacement one the other swap
from<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:44.750> here<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.560> couple<00:02:46.040> removed<00:02:46.520> there<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
from up here a couple removed there and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.900 
from up here a couple removed there and
there<00:02:48.920> was<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.520> other<00:02:49.580> one

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
there was the other one

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.000 
there was the other one
you've<00:02:50.180> also<00:02:50.360> can<00:02:50.690> see<00:02:50.870> my<00:02:51.080> little<00:02:51.560> LED

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
you've also can see my little LED

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.250 
you've also can see my little LED
instead<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.670> diode<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.990> other<00:02:54.140> die

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
instead of a diode and the other die

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.699 
instead of a diode and the other die
within<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.800> behind<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
within there behind it so that is a

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.560 
within there behind it so that is a
simple<00:02:58.190> on-off<00:02:58.459> switch<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.209> that's<00:02:59.300> what<00:02:59.510> the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
simple on-off switch and that's what the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.610 
simple on-off switch and that's what the
circuit<00:02:59.840> board<00:02:59.990> looks<00:03:00.170> like<00:03:00.230> after

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
circuit board looks like after

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.830 
circuit board looks like after
completion<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.390> might<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.570> wondering

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
completion so you might be wondering

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.020 
completion so you might be wondering
just<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.740> changes<00:03:04.010> were<00:03:04.400> actually

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
just what these changes were actually

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.630 
just what these changes were actually
doing<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.750> pedal<00:03:06.080> well<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.340> big

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
doing for the pedal well this big

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.840 
doing for the pedal well this big
pattern<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:08.720> plus<00:03:09.230> these<00:03:09.620> two<00:03:10.160> diode

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
pattern here plus these two diode

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.840 
pattern here plus these two diode
changes<00:03:11.450> where<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.530> increase<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.520> dynamic

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
changes where to increase the dynamic

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.080 
changes where to increase the dynamic
fullness<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> pedal<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:16.000> removing<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
fullness of the pedal and removing the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.570 
fullness of the pedal and removing the
capstone<00:03:17.540> here<00:03:17.870> site<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.440> moving<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.370> one

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
capstone here site and moving this one

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.840 
capstone here site and moving this one
over<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:21.080> reduce<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.010> harshness<00:03:22.520> so

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
over was to reduce the harshness so

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.550 
over was to reduce the harshness so
that's<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.180> table<00:03:23.600> bite<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.170> Fadel

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that's that table bite that the Fadel

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's that table bite that the Fadel
had<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.890> was<00:03:24.980> very<00:03:25.160> harsh<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:25.880> then<00:03:26.600> so

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
had it was very harsh and then so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.830 
had it was very harsh and then so
removing<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.980> caps<00:03:28.220> with<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.480> addition<00:03:29.780> of

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
removing the caps with the addition of

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.449 
removing the caps with the addition of
that<00:03:29.989> one<00:03:30.230> was<00:03:30.500> reducing<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.890> harshness<00:03:31.160> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
that one was reducing the harshness and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.060 
that one was reducing the harshness and
that's<00:03:32.360> cap<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.810> those<00:03:32.930> two<00:03:33.080> diodes<00:03:33.500> filled

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
that's cap and those two diodes filled

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.620 
that's cap and those two diodes filled
it<00:03:34.250> with<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.430> light<00:03:34.580> range<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:35.000> bit<00:03:35.120> more<00:03:35.330> and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
it with a light range a bit more and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.350 
it with a light range a bit more and
changing<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.530> capacitor<00:03:37.130> 36<00:03:37.730> over<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> back

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
changing that capacitor 36 over the back

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.039 
changing that capacitor 36 over the back
there<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.989> was<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.709> make<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> EQ<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.480> lot<00:03:41.870> more

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
there that was to make the EQ a lot more

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.830 
there that was to make the EQ a lot more
useful<00:03:42.500> than<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:42.980> originally<00:03:43.070> was<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.510> if<00:03:44.720> you

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
useful than it originally was so if you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.140 
useful than it originally was so if you
feel<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.350> you<00:03:46.100> want<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.790> know<00:03:46.880> not<00:03:47.120> have

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
feel that you want to you know not have

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.030 
feel that you want to you know not have
as<00:03:47.360> much<00:03:47.510> fullness<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.290> maybe<00:03:48.440> back<00:03:49.010> off

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
as much fullness you can maybe back off

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.190 
as much fullness you can maybe back off
the<00:03:49.430> value<00:03:49.700> of<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:49.850> capacitor<00:03:50.450> slightly<00:03:50.900> or

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
the value of this capacitor slightly or

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.949 
the value of this capacitor slightly or
if<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:52.640> like<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.150> harshness<00:03:53.510> maybe<00:03:53.870> you

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
if you like that harshness maybe you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.360 
if you like that harshness maybe you
want<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.140> leave<00:03:54.290> some<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.590> these<00:03:54.739> capacitors

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
want to leave some of these capacitors

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.509 
want to leave some of these capacitors
alone<00:03:55.610> let<00:03:55.940> me<00:03:56.000> keep<00:03:56.180> number<00:03:56.750> 25<00:03:57.310> there<00:03:58.310> or

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
alone let me keep number 25 there or

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.100 
alone let me keep number 25 there or
something<00:03:58.850> like<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.110> experiment

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
something like that experiment

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.780 
something like that experiment
experiment<00:04:00.530> away<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.130> see<00:04:01.280> if<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.489> can<00:04:01.640> make

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
experiment away and see if you can make

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.190 
experiment away and see if you can make
the<00:04:01.910> pedal<00:04:02.180> sound<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.480> way<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.600> want<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.019> do

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
the pedal sound the way you want to do

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.039 
the pedal sound the way you want to do
so<00:04:03.860> that's<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.190> modification<00:04:04.880> done<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.810> we

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
that's quite a difference the sound of

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.519 
that's quite a difference the sound of
this<00:06:04.039> pedal<00:06:04.279> of<00:06:05.089> course<00:06:05.330> now<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:05.569> EQ<00:06:06.110> is<00:06:06.259> so

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 
this pedal of course now the EQ is so

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.409 
this pedal of course now the EQ is so
much<00:06:06.709> more<00:06:06.949> usable<00:06:07.459> as<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.879> can<00:06:08.029> see<00:06:08.239> right

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
much more usable as you can see right

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:30.999 
much more usable as you can see right
here

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
with that reduction in the harshness and

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.980 
with that reduction in the harshness and
the<00:07:27.460> filling<00:07:27.790> out<00:07:27.910> of<00:07:27.940> the<00:07:28.090> base<00:07:28.360> end<00:07:28.690> we<00:07:28.840> need

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
the filling out of the base end we need

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.350 
the filling out of the base end we need
to<00:07:29.140> look<00:07:29.290> at<00:07:29.470> our<00:07:29.530> EQ<00:07:29.890> a<00:07:29.920> little<00:07:30.220> bit<00:07:30.400> more<00:07:30.700> when

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
to look at our EQ a little bit more when

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.060 
to look at our EQ a little bit more when
we're<00:07:31.540> dialing<00:07:31.930> in<00:07:32.110> ourselves<00:07:32.650> but<00:07:32.830> we<00:07:32.950> can

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
we're dialing in ourselves but we can

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.380 
we're dialing in ourselves but we can
get<00:07:33.190> some<00:07:33.280> excellent<00:07:33.670> sounds<00:07:34.030> oh<00:07:34.120> that's
