 he hid his moment considered today that we want to imagine this 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.350
 because in relation to what happened on Saturday night at the stadium 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.969
 jalisco is 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.619
 then unexplained function that supposedly little boy the cube towers erick towers 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.769
 at the time of celebrating 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.560
 well a sign 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.980
 what the line judge apparently josé luis camargo one of the most 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.320
 featured attendees interpreting art as an obscene signal towards the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 bar of the satiety towards a roma night does some in the rest rivero manager 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.880
 this nor of camargo interpreter that defended live we are all the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.580
 media 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.120
 not as a kind of the nba the muse of cinema the referee passed the report 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.579
 go see it before the game resumes after a goal 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.820
 which appears to many I could not be in hours the situation of the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.470
 choice of dilma in count 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.460
 percent and it's even on the road from the stars easier when 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.220
 the referee returns to the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.410
 to the position 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.620
 I already told you they are like two and a half minutes later to the quota that is a 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.590
 so much good today there are loans salvador haas 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 magaña he is the president of the irreverent bar 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
 and this explains and this was not the case 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.900
 percent 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 sanz in some scene in reference to his 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 in this case what resulted in a pass from the environment I think that 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.000
 are two R's against is a form of d &amp; s of newspapers by the bar and apart 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.550
 recently there were people believe is supporting them in this case the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.450
 irreverent we are supporting with all the juice and well we are going to do it with more 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.430
 force 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.690
 for now they gave him two suspension games 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.540
 a game when inconsistencies are supposed to be here 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.780
 p if the ones expelled for insulting 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.000
 it could not be a match, it will have to be at least 2 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 they know that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.230
 used to the regulation 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.420
 what is said today in the disciplinary commission with this gentleman or savater 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.210
 Well, almost everyone gets out today 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.479
 with what come the cedulas 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.049
 and dismiss depending on the punishment each club will be unconformable 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.959
 and I think that as soon as they read it they are already sued 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.620
 In all began to arrive the nonconformists has clarified that to change 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.140
 the view of the referees must prove that they are wrong we understand 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
 to see everything we have photos videos everything we have 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.319
 with that the next one does not commit a team fault 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.749
 certainly I have to regret that they are wrong in describing 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.709
 one of the fugitives mistake all that if we can punish local in the part 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.589
 technique 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.659
 in that if he has the intention or not someone thought about all that is or 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.139
 directly the tony kanaan arbitration commission 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.379
 your liking courtesy stages both the savior of him 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.469
 by troops like this one, not these components or sports rafa steel 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.009
 they said they are obscene 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:05.719
 mental the bar 2 good well out there will have to come here the punishment as 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.259
 you 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.759
 and in case it is not an obscene signal then 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.959
 was repelled by the provocation so imminent beast 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.199
 a state party insists inconsistencies 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.999
 let's see what this issue ends up with as it wants to throw ice, not if 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.409
 There was a mistake 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 of the referee or center triplet and an assistant 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.849
 they have to recognize it 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.189
 and they have to take punishment because this leading role also originates 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.369
 this story 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.639
 an experienced ballarin assistant 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.499
 the media player that is camargo is practically saying the party in 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.249
 yours was scored a penalty where it was not 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.159
 the brand works with denver a line judge taking advantage of his of course 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.579
 the dignity of the central judges
