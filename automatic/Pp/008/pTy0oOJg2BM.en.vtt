00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.170
 many have by turns only one small explanation of text concerning 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.359
 the flashcode technique 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.409
 from what I understood 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.499
 we can see that I'm using a small nest egg 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.060
 when I'm moving 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.499
 energy prices 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.499
 from the moment when seems more realistic 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.750
 from the moment the score slightly ridiculous on prices I 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.729
 am still in place 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.729
 that will practically be saying 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.610
 to narrow the ranks at the point of commissions normally stopped 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 for the rat that evokes to ask you why it is also possible 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 to vote 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.240
 that's what will allow the fesf 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.630
 galinier the target correctly 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.880
 perfect technical vistaquest 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.320
 if I say simply that the Serb problem 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.600
 if the game isabelle huppert the bar 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.620
 maybe I'm going to suffer from refinement that was stopping a bit at 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.120
 right a little left a little 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 the glorifies body 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 there it allows me to really animals 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.680
 this same place of work 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.950
 analysis 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.320
 it's a win 6 at psg society 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 HAART 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 lurking not trying to live somewhere 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 very often at the controls 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.240
 to increase a little practiced a game 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 15 50 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 in absolute terms but I think we do 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
 so with a little practice we can count ourselves correctly 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 seck every time we got 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.050
 his alibi at the site 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190
 savard practically every time 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.310
 with a little workout for City Hall after 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.780
 in the eu for the timing to almost double 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690
 this one does not answer 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 the monster goes perfectly under the umbrella a little bit more 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.680
 citroen c5 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.910
 difficult for me however I can draw 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.160
 rent it works very very well 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.970
 so here's the bottom you said that the technique could not work and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.249
 that they do not make recipes of the day 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:10.879
 Saturday the two are four 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.549
 if we do it works perfectly 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.540
 go I'll leave you and then we'll try to keep quiet anyway ten duets with 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.979
 sales of the activity 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.169
 safin of montreal 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.579
 beyond grassy path 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.739
 what all the other teams 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.529
 we can do this time dirtyh on football
