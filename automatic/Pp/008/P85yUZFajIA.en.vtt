00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.420

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.969
 birthmarks on the quality of his goods more 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.200
 the game of the type of game lost 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 now speak try guys of course 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.720
 we can and are very much such series of dishes with us 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.519
 the games themselves are very heavy therefore not 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.029
 lack of freshness and not very much 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 each of course this weather to come 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.880
 play + 10 + sunny 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.740
 spring is hard for us since the morning could of course 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 questions about this until we 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.420
 I understand why it is force majeure though 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 but the weather a week should not even 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.050
 woke up in the morning and plus 30 weeks already 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.640
 ice there is no plus weather for the top ten ice 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.590
 then we feel sorry for any place what 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 questions there she did nothing happen 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 the boss still knew about it i think 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 I think learning to play rhythm 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.969
 Let us say salad, then tell us 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.690
 enough and malia with I'm not saying that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.009
 we are there so why I think what we say 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.990
 force majeure, we have sex until a certain 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.460
 relationship 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.439
 although it does not detract from merit say 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.890
 that we played today but showed 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.220
 you yourself do not have a long time of course I think that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 goes to the radio market is already on play 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.440
 any time there is no night 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.160
 any weather 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:35.360
 this time to facets hockey everyone to sit 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 I have no comments on the game, we all 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 beat the score on the board preparing for 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.440
 tomorrow's boys who will 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.440
 very important strong here are all the comments 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.200
 enough lilac questions 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:53.660
 I will ask a question how to evaluate and ice 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.660
 how good was hard simple 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:04.229

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.990
 Well, the cattle breaks guards human 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.090
 extra 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.069
 I do not know me the first half ice almost 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.739
 perfect i think in terms of 8 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.080
 degrees of direct heat of the sun is better 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.160
 do not take i thank of course 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.519
 flooded the question what if still layovic 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.140
 literally before the start of the first half 12 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.530
 40 minutes with what bind this right 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.870
 torn failure that people were ready 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.870
 the best moments for what you teach
