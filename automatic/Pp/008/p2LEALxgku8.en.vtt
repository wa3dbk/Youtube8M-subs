 Supplies 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.690
 So open this part of the foot 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.660
 And then it is the height loosen the individual screws 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.660
 And properly adjusted

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.140
 Yes I would like to do this 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.600
 It becomes a microphone stand 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.200
 Unscrew the center screw 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.730
 If so, here is this angle adjustment 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.410
 You will be able to do this 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.430

 I think it's good 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.770
 I think here is great 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.699
 As much as height 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.270
 It is quite expensive 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.400
 And adjust the height, I'm not alone here 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.600

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:17.210
 Is this cool 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.210
 It looks like a professional with a condenser microphone and a pop guard 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.909
 It is good , so this time 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:38.990
 It was introduction of classic pro microphone stand here 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:41.160

 I'm not doing it 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.810
 If it was cheap because of no Chatchinja Toka worry 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.729
