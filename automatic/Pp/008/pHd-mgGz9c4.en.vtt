lot so here we go this is uh going to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.110 
lot so here we go this is uh going to
zoom<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.910> much<00:00:51.000> what

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
zoom out here this is pretty much what

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910 
zoom out here this is pretty much what
i've<00:00:51.360> done<00:00:51.510> i've<00:00:51.719> added<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> exterior

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
i've done i've added a lot of exterior

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.380 
i've done i've added a lot of exterior
environments<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> bug

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
environments because there was a bug

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
environments because there was a bug
where<00:00:54.629> i<00:00:54.690> would<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:55.050> able<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.100> knock<00:00:56.370> enemies

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
where i would be able to knock enemies

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
where i would be able to knock enemies
outside<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> perimeter<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.520> i<00:01:00.030> think

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
outside of the perimeter so now i think

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.860 
outside of the perimeter so now i think
by<00:01:01.140> adding<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.649> bunch<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.149> kind<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> clutter<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
by adding a bunch of kind of clutter to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
by adding a bunch of kind of clutter to
the<00:01:03.989> outside<00:01:04.379> i've<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> prevented<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the outside i've kind of prevented that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
the outside i've kind of prevented that
from<00:01:05.489> happening<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.600> added<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.960> bunch<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
from happening and i added a bunch of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
from happening and i added a bunch of
spectators<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> outside<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.240> have

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
spectators on the outside and we have

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
spectators on the outside and we have
guard<00:01:09.630> towers<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.040> spotlights

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
guard towers which have these spotlights

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.429 
guard towers which have these spotlights
that<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.240> which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that are going around which is really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.539 
that are going around which is really
cool<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.369> actually

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.499 
playing it and there's just kind of
spotlights<00:01:16.380> moving<00:01:16.710> around<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.509> adds

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
spotlights moving around it really adds

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
spotlights moving around it really adds
to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> atmosphere<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> pretty

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I took a lot of the criticisms from the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.540 
I took a lot of the criticisms from the
video<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.650> showed<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.920> guys<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> last

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
video that I showed you guys the last

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.450 
video that I showed you guys the last
time<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.600> kind<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.960> premiered<00:02:35.320> my<00:02:35.470> my<00:02:36.340> own

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
time I I kind of premiered my my own

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.550 
time I I kind of premiered my my own
user<00:02:36.820> made<00:02:37.060> level<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.080> took<00:02:38.140> some<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
user made level and I took some of the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.220 
user made level and I took some of the
criticisms<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.760> comments<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.870> kind<00:02:41.110> of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
criticisms and comments and kind of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.860 
criticisms and comments and kind of
applied<00:02:41.680> them<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.820> new<00:02:43.180> version<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.840> i

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
applied them to this new version so i

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.180 
applied them to this new version so i
took<00:02:43.990> out<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.500> militia<00:02:44.920> soldiers

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
took out all the militia soldiers

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.850 
took out all the militia soldiers
because<00:02:45.820> they<00:02:46.720> held<00:02:46.930> they<00:02:47.080> all<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.350> guns<00:02:47.380> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
because they held they all have guns and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.340 
because they held they all have guns and
it<00:02:47.890> kind<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.330> takes<00:02:49.330> away<00:02:49.480> from<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.840> gameplay

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
it kind of takes away from the gameplay

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.960 
it kind of takes away from the gameplay
because<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:51.010> basically<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.460> stand<00:02:51.880> there

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
because they basically just stand there

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
because they basically just stand there
and<00:02:52.090> shoot<00:02:52.300> at<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:52.960> that<00:02:53.140> fun

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
and shoot at you and it's not that fun

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.350 
and shoot at you and it's not that fun
so<00:02:53.590> i<00:02:53.620> added<00:02:53.830> just<00:02:54.100> swamp<00:02:54.790> monsters<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
so i added just swamp monsters and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.490 
so i added just swamp monsters and
whatnot<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:57.870> also<00:02:58.870> some<00:02:59.200> people<00:02:59.440> were

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
whatnot and also some people were

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.950 
whatnot and also some people were
commenting<00:02:59.710> at<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.820> title<00:03:01.210> of<00:03:01.300> my<00:03:01.540> my

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
commenting at the the title of my my

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.500 
commenting at the the title of my my
level<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.590> they<00:03:03.160> didn't<00:03:03.580> think<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
level and they didn't think the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.110 
level and they didn't think the
numerator<00:03:05.110> rina<00:03:05.350> was<00:03:05.680> very<00:03:06.070> appealing<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.880> i

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
numerator rina was very appealing so i

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.330 
numerator rina was very appealing so i
changed<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.900> i<00:03:08.320> forgot<00:03:08.830> what<00:03:08.860> i<00:03:08.980> changed<00:03:09.250> it

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
changed it to i forgot what i changed it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.370 
changed it to i forgot what i changed it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380

much the same but it seems like there's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.300 
much the same but it seems like there's
a<00:03:54.599> lot<00:03:54.629> more<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.349> almost<00:03:55.530> with<00:03:55.709> every<00:03:56.069> kill

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

trick here is to snipe them and you can

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.289 
trick here is to snipe them and you can
just<00:04:07.019> take<00:04:07.169> them<00:04:07.319> out<00:04:07.439> in<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:07.650> hit<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.819> there

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580

little bit so I thought it'd be kind of
cool<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.840> description<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.620> new<00:04:55.740> one<00:04:55.949> is
