00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello to all of you it's steven 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 and today I will explain 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 how to make the tethered jailbreak 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.690
 your iphone 3gs iphone 4 ipod touch 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.560
 4g which is under a bone 6.0 or else 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.390
 ios 6.0.1 for that we will use the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 snowbreeze software that works 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.500
 only on windows and that is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.560
 now compatible with the 6.0 and the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.149
 6.0.1 as usual in the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.649
 description of the video find yourself 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 download links for the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.280
 software so you download you the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.870
 put on your computer 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 and then you right click 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 on top you will go into property 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.899
 and you make sure that you have 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 checked the compatibility as 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.739
 service pack 3 for windows xp it's 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.000
 very important to do it and then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.610
 you run it as 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 that snowbreeze admin goes so 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.539
 open here is what it looks like 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 how come this software you 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.690
 click ok and here we come to the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 main page 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.610
 we find all compatibilities on 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 see that it works in 6.0 and 6.1 0 points 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.270
 so no worries but on the other hand 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.770
 we specify that this is a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.420
 jailbreak of tethered type 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.010
 which means you will need to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530
 your computer to restart your 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.729
 iphone or ipod touch 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.439
 So here for the little news 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.570
 go on by clicking now 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.070
 on the arrow there on this new view 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 we are told to select the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.970
 Firmware corresponding to our device 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.470
 if you do not have it on the computer 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.909
 no problem you can 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.130
 download by going to this 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 section you select your device 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.090
 and then you select the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.329
 firmeware that fits soyal is this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.350
 6.0 is 6.0.1 and then you 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.000
 click on download 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.950
 if you already have it click 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.350
 directly here like me and you 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 select snowbreeze tells you 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 that he recognized firmeware and that it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 works we can move on after 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.390
 we come to this menu with three 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.000
 sections did what simpl mode and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.590
 expert month mode you can see that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
 I only have three menus but if you 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 have an iphone 4 or an iphone 3gs you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.930
 will have this fourth menu baseband 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.970
 preservation 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.130
 so as its name indicates if you 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.170
 want to jailbreak and keep your 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.330
 baseband to then make a dÃ©simlock 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.550
 and therefore keep a baseband compatible 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.320
 and clicked on this section 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.670
 to make this jailbreak and this 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.070
 boy band conservation 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.080
 if you are concerned then you use 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.970
 this section otherwise if you want 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.800
 achieve a classic jailbreak you 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.130
 do like me you click on simple 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.990
 mode and there you click on no thank you 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.430
 then we go on this view so 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.750
 as you've noticed from everything to 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.190
 the time the jailbreak using 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.020
 snowbreeze is really not the same 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.180
 that using redsnow is a small 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.160
 little different there the goal is to create 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.520
 a custom firmware so a version 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.290
 custom of a bone 6 or a bone 6.0 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.000
 point regardless of what you have 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.250
 chosen and in this version 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.430
 custom of the firm we go there 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.570
 place cydia using snowbreeze 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.310
 then once we've created this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.380
 custom firmware we will use it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.239
 will remain with itunes 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.709
 so I do not worry it can you 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.510
 look a bit complicated but that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.430
 works very very well and I'm going 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.310
 explain to you step by step how 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.780
 do it soon is over and you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.290
 can also see movement on 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.239
 my desk 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.670
 finally when snowbreeze shows you 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.620
 this window we're done with the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.720
 first part the custom firmware is 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.750
 created and can also be noticed 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.390
 on the desk next step next 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.430
 must put our device in dfu mode 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.920
 so you take your iphone 3gs iphone 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.690
 4 ipod touch 4g and you hold 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.250
 long the two buttons the button 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.900
 home and the power button for a 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.000
 ten seconds you hold the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 two simultaneously 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.180
 then you release power and you 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.250
 continue to hold the home button and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.730
 when you see a black screen like 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.440
 that your device is in dfu mode 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.239
 back on the computer one continues 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.760
 to use snowbreeze and click on 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.130
 the start button here at the bottom then we 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.410
 sees running high reb our device is going 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.230
 so switch from dfu mode to pound mode 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.579
 edf was so it's an advanced dfu mode 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.380
 which will allow us to dodge 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.090
 some itunes errors during the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.500
 restoration 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.329
 you can leave snowbreeze on it 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.190
 more need and we will use the 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.720
 custom firmware that we created everything 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.130
 at the time that is now on 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.450
 your office or so in the same 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.389
 directory that your firmware 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.609
 selected it contains cydia and we're going 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.410
 use it to restore with itunes 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.209
 there you see that he has detected our 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.490
 device in restore mode you 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.139
 so click ok and then you 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.540
 press the shift key on your 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.639
 keyboard then on restore and there you 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.160
 select your custom firmware which 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.960
 must start with snowbreeze then 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.050
 you confirm the restoration to ios 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.030
 6 or 6.0.1 regardless of what you 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.800
 have done and on your device you 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.810
 go see the apple apple and then 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.520
 the little snowbreeze logo the little snowflake 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.820
 of snow with a loading bar in 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.919
 underneath the restoration can take 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.930
 several minutes I accelerated everything 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.880
 here and there I find myself on the page of 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.830
 configuration of less i-pod game 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.850
 unlocks and we configure you 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.560
 know the steps 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.900
 of course we choose to use 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.600
 the device is on the second page of the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.699
 springboard here we are in cydia you can 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.110
 open it but not use it 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.030
 you see that each time it leaves 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.250
 because it's a tethered jailbreak 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.960
 so we have one last step to 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.850
 do you go to the same place 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.010
 that you have placed redsnow and there a 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.990
 new software had to be created there 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.639
 is called ibooty you're going to have to 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.460
 select your device me it's 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.370
 me i pod touch 4g and then again a 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.110
 times we have to put it in dfu mode 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.550
 it's exactly the same technique that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.320
 just now the manipulation and the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.240
 even you hold the button for a long time 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.040
 home &amp; power for 10 seconds then 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.750
 you release the power button and you 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.090
 continue to hold the home button 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.310
 you stay like that about 10 seconds 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.280
 and then when your screen and black 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.229
 like that your device is in dfu mode 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.340
 on ibooty you click on start and 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.900
 you are going to have bars of 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.430
 loading that will fill it's 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.930
 normal you do not disconnect me your 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.250
 apparatus 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.410
 this is the very last step of this 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.910
 jailbreak and when ibooty shows you 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.190
 give is well there it's totally 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.139
 finished you can leave it and we have 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.180
 finished now everything is happening on our 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.040
 device you can unlock it 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.310
 you go to the second page of the 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.320
 springboard 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.450
 you open cydia and this time it does not 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.070
 leaves not you see that it works you 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.290
 just choose your type 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.400
 of user you do ok and then 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.930
 the page loads 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.960
 and here you are able to use 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.670
 cydia your device jailbroken your 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.430
 iphone or your ipod touch is 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.580
 now totally jailbroken in 6.0 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.410
 or 6.0.1 and if you checked the 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.950
 boy band preservation and well that has 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.620
 worked 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.570
 So here is this tutorial I hope 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.040
 that he will have helped you remember that he 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.230
 this is a tethered type jailbreak
