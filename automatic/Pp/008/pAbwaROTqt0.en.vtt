some people but definitely something

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.910 
some people but definitely something
worth<00:04:32.490> checking<00:04:33.090> out<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.900> camera<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.530> is

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
worth checking out the camera in it is

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.800 
worth checking out the camera in it is
also<00:04:35.400> pretty<00:04:35.610> decent<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.540> 8<00:04:36.660> megapixel

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
also pretty decent the 8 megapixel

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.950 
also pretty decent the 8 megapixel
camera<00:04:37.650> although<00:04:38.310> did<00:04:38.550> have<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:39.090> pink<00:04:39.450> spot<00:04:39.780> in

the<00:04:40.110> center<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.410> mine<00:04:40.710> when<00:04:40.920> I<00:04:40.950> put<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
the center of mine when I put it on a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.250 
the center of mine when I put it on a
white<00:04:41.610> wall<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.390> I'm<00:04:42.510> not<00:04:42.630> quite<00:04:42.900> sure<00:04:42.930> what

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
white wall so I'm not quite sure what

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.690 
white wall so I'm not quite sure what
that's<00:04:43.410> about<00:04:43.590> but<00:04:43.770> we've<00:04:44.160> seen<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.550> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
that's about but we've seen that and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.240 
that's about but we've seen that and
other<00:04:44.820> phones<00:04:45.150> like<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.540> Lumia<00:04:45.690> 900<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.650> this

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
other phones like the Lumia 900 and this

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.220 
other phones like the Lumia 900 and this
had<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.610> as<00:04:47.700> well<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.120> when<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.270> was<00:04:48.480> facing<00:04:49.140> this

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
had it as well so when I was facing this

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.080 
had it as well so when I was facing this
right<00:04:49.470> at<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.650> white<00:04:49.830> wall<00:04:50.070> hit<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.610> camera

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
right at a white wall hit the camera

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.060 
right at a white wall hit the camera
button<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.510> actually<00:04:51.990> stopped<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.740> looked<00:04:52.890> and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
button I actually stopped and looked and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.550 
button I actually stopped and looked and
saw<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.340> bright<00:04:53.850> pink<00:04:54.450> spot<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> middle<00:04:55.200> so

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
saw a bright pink spot in the middle so

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.500 
saw a bright pink spot in the middle so
I<00:04:55.770> don't<00:04:56.160> know<00:04:56.220> what<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.580> in<00:04:57.210> particular

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
I don't know what that is in particular

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.930 
I don't know what that is in particular
with<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.170> camera<00:04:58.860> or<00:04:59.160> maybe<00:04:59.460> it's<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.700> same

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
with this camera or maybe it's the same

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.370 
with this camera or maybe it's the same
camera<00:05:00.300> that<00:05:00.420> they're<00:05:00.570> using<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.050> those<00:05:01.230> other

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
camera that they're using in those other

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.710 
camera that they're using in those other
devices<00:05:01.740> but<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:02.640> didn't<00:05:03.030> find<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.510> really

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
devices but I didn't find that it really

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.020 
devices but I didn't find that it really
degraded<00:05:04.200> too<00:05:04.350> much<00:05:04.470> from<00:05:04.650> image<00:05:05.040> quality<00:05:05.280> it

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
degraded too much from image quality it

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.760 
degraded too much from image quality it
was<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.510> there<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:06.930> obviously<00:05:07.050> they're

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
was just there and obviously they're

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.160 
was just there and obviously they're
against<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.820> white<00:05:09.000> background<00:05:09.170> benchmark

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
against a white background benchmark

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.170 
against a white background benchmark
wise<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:11.040> actually<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.460> pretty<00:05:11.490> fast<00:05:11.880> phone<00:05:12.150> i

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
wise it's actually a pretty fast phone i

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.360

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
fast it's about the same speed or a

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.200 
fast it's about the same speed or a
little<00:05:19.140> bit<00:05:19.260> faster<00:05:19.740> than<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.010> HTC<00:05:20.580> One<00:05:20.790> X<00:05:20.940> in
