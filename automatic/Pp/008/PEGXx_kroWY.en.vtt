today<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:07.230> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> try<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.890> static

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
today we're going to try the static

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.990 
today we're going to try the static
grass<00:00:09.059> out<00:00:09.830> see<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.309> go<00:00:13.610> try<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.849> these

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
grass out see here we go try it on these

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.560 
grass out see here we go try it on these
two<00:00:15.059> color<00:00:15.660> combinations<00:00:16.500> here<00:00:17.210> put<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> glue

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
two color combinations here put a glue

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:30.590 
two color combinations here put a glue
down<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.990> start<00:00:19.289> with

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.880 

Marlon<00:00:32.040> give<00:00:33.040> us<00:00:33.130> something<00:00:33.490> to<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:34.570> earth

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
Marlon give us something to to earth

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:44.700 
Marlon give us something to to earth
everything<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:39.100> we're<00:00:39.610> using<00:00:43.710> Ozzie

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
everything to now we're using Ozzie

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.160 
everything to now we're using Ozzie
cynics<00:00:45.750> static<00:00:46.750> grass<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:48.550> three<00:00:48.850> mill

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
cynics static grass just the three mill

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.680 
cynics static grass just the three mill
one<00:00:50.170> what<00:00:50.950> I've<00:00:51.070> done<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.489> it's<00:00:52.030> mixed<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.540> bit

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
one what I've done is it's mixed a bit

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.380 
one what I've done is it's mixed a bit
of<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.680> Daintree<00:00:54.340> green<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:58.239> it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
of the the Daintree green and does it

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.780 
of the the Daintree green and does it
scrub<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.710> top<00:01:00.010> bit<00:01:00.220> just<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.610> see

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
scrub just for this top bit just to see

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.820 
scrub just for this top bit just to see
how<00:01:00.970> she<00:01:01.090> comes<00:01:01.390> out<00:01:02.220> put<00:01:03.220> it<00:01:03.340> in<00:01:03.489> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
how she comes out put it in the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:16.880 
how she comes out put it in the
applicator<00:01:07.380> $40<00:01:08.380> from<00:01:09.509> steady<00:01:11.640> fuzzy<00:01:12.640> cynics

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.870 

basically<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.070> sort<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.340> like<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.490> torch

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
basically it's sort of like a torch

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.370 
basically it's sort of like a torch
without<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:20.910> light<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.740> holds<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.520> charge<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
without a light just holds the charge is

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.609 
without a light just holds the charge is
the<00:01:26.410> container<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.840> grass<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:32.380> your

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
the container the grass in it get your

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
the container the grass in it get your
grounding<00:01:33.160> wire<00:01:34.050> yeah

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.480 

the<00:01:46.840> two-handed<00:01:47.410> operation<00:01:48.130> but<00:01:53.160> if<00:01:54.160> you<00:01:54.280> just

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
the two-handed operation but if you just

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.860 
the two-handed operation but if you just
hold<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.150> battery<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:57.690> press<00:01:58.690> the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
hold the battery here and press the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:14.360 
hold the battery here and press the
button<00:01:59.280> that<00:02:00.280> sends<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.850> charge<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.030> go

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
button that sends the charge there we go

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.130 
button that sends the charge there we go
when<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.550> finished<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.060> though<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.050> this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
when you're finished it though and this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.570 
when you're finished it though and this
is<00:02:17.200> pointed<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.950> try<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.280> plug<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> other

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
is pointed out to try and plug the other

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.030 
is pointed out to try and plug the other
day<00:02:18.850> because<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.780> has<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> static<00:02:20.470> charge<00:02:20.500> in

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
day because this has a static charge in

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.770 
day because this has a static charge in
it<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.340> don't<00:02:21.610> know<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.090> will<00:02:22.210> show<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.600> or

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it I don't know if it will show up or

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.770 
it I don't know if it will show up or
not<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:24.070> have<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> discharge<00:02:27.570> otherwise<00:02:28.570> they

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
not you have to discharge otherwise they

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
not you have to discharge otherwise they
can<00:02:28.960> zap<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.410> also<00:02:29.620> keep<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.250> away<00:02:30.340> from

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
can zap but also keep it away from

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
can zap but also keep it away from
people<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:31.000> I've<00:02:31.090> got<00:02:31.240> pacemakers<00:02:32.010> because

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
people that I've got pacemakers because

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.080 
people that I've got pacemakers because
it<00:02:33.160> may<00:02:33.340> even<00:02:33.700> affect<00:02:33.820> their<00:02:34.210> pacemaker<00:02:36.090> take

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
it may even affect their pacemaker take

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.350 
it may even affect their pacemaker take
the<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.930> out

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.990 

just<00:02:41.360> say<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.660> get<00:02:41.810> an<00:02:42.320> idea<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.610> done<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
just say can get an idea of just done a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.140 
just say can get an idea of just done a
little<00:02:44.210> test<00:02:44.600> block<00:02:45.520> so<00:02:46.520> you<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
little test block so you can see the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.180 
little test block so you can see the
grass<00:02:47.390> up<00:02:47.750> close<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.320> had<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
grass up close but had to do it on the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.360 
grass up close but had to do it on the
layout<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:50.440> show<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.500> how<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.980> sort<00:02:52.220> of

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
layout just show you how it sort of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:04.890 
layout just show you how it sort of
stands<00:02:52.820> up<00:02:55.900> longer<00:02:56.900> fibers<00:02:57.380> kicking<00:02:57.770> in<00:02:57.920> there

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.940 

what<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.140> charge<00:03:06.500> does<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.760> electric<00:03:08.950> static

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
what the charge does the electric static

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.030 
what the charge does the electric static
electricity<00:03:10.570> stands<00:03:11.570> are<00:03:11.780> up<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.650> as<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:12.950> can

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
electricity stands are up and as you can

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.850 
electricity stands are up and as you can
see<00:03:13.100> there's<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.670> mixture<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:15.709> the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
see there's the mixture of the of the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:25.570 
see there's the mixture of the of the
brown<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.370> brain<00:03:23.290> okay<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.500> time<00:03:24.580> we're

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
brown and brain okay this time we're

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.750 
brown and brain okay this time we're
going<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.970> have<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> bit<00:03:26.420> more<00:03:27.310> lighter<00:03:28.310> green

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
going to have a bit more lighter green

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.750 
going to have a bit more lighter green
new<00:03:29.150> growth<00:03:29.560> for<00:03:30.560> some<00:03:30.770> of<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:30.980> areas<00:03:31.459> that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
new growth for some of the areas that

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.880 
new growth for some of the areas that
are<00:03:31.940> obviously<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.810> bit<00:03:33.709> flatter<00:03:34.690> and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.580 

now<00:03:38.220> would<00:03:38.430> possibly<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.300> more<00:03:39.870> rain<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.170> them

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
now would possibly get more rain on them

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.710 
now would possibly get more rain on them
that's<00:03:40.740> just<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> theory<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:42.330> I'm<00:03:42.420> just<00:03:42.570> going

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that's just the theory so I'm just going

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.990 
that's just the theory so I'm just going
to<00:03:42.810> lighten<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.290> up<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.560> little<00:03:43.710> bit<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.340> we'll

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to lighten it up a little bit and we'll

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:06.830 
to lighten it up a little bit and we'll
see<00:03:45.180> how<00:03:45.330> we<00:03:45.390> go<00:03:45.630> with<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.020> again<00:04:02.780> just<00:04:05.840> while

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
see how we go with that again just while

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:45.550 
see how we go with that again just while
it's<00:04:06.870> drying<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.830> can<00:04:11.360> some<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.570> excess
