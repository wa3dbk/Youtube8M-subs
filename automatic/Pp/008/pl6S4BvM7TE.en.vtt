00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 moin together, please excuse that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.220
 slightly pixelated pictures on the side 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.810
 but that goes off I say 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 legal reasons are not different 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 that is not allowed 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.210
 be published or shown that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.320
 here next to me is the new weapon of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 novak djokovic 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.430
 The whole thing is called speed pro hat 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.379
 but nothing more with the speed pro 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 predecessors and what exactly is that 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.059
 I've changed that in the now 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.649
 detail like one or the other 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 maybe already noticed 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.159
 me to you we kings internally 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.479
 called 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.030
 got this black frame from head 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.760
 and the tested while doing a device 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 that was also labeled where I was from 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.190
 If you think that would have the new bell 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780
 can be with a weapon 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 Looking back, I have to say it now 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.559
 what could not but not to the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.449
 knowledge is the weight came about 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.589
 I would have said even if it was one 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.120
 Approaches bit easier but I 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.100
 believe that is synonymous with the district 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.079
 in the case with on the material new 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 bassists to hide so the 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.479
 Technology - has called in the case was 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.189
 It's not that far 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 brought to compare the 16 19 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 educate something like that everything was right 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.079
 maybe the biggest frame agreed 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.710
 Everything is a bit thicker than you 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.450
 but far from it all 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.909
 Data has changed fundamentally 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 Here you can see the old specs of the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.789
 old as I quote my quotes 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.179
 old vitro by novak djokovic now 98s 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.130
 head 335 grams unaccompanied 31er 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.659
 Balance very important, yes, even ran 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.619
 profil 18 mm including 16 19 pages Image 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.729
 and that they take here is it the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.859
 specs of the 9th 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.119
 you can see the only thing there 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.159
 the length is actually left 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.299
 the racket and the balance otherwise 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.159
 weight 315 grams between 18 and 20 pages 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.719
 picture and the frame is none 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.399
 Namely takes 22 mm 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.039
 Say it all has rings all around 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.749
 completely changed reason for me that 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.920
 thing to test because usually 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.810
 You know that that will maybe 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.740
 new technology integrates but the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.090
 racket stays on 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.470
 similar in this case stop 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.849
 not at all, especially not only 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.440
 new paint on it whatever that 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.450
 There's always rumors and us in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.190
 In this case completely new racket so 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.480
 reason for me to try the thing times 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.920
 even if it may not show yet 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.349
 I have not tested since we see 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 now a bit of a few 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.470
 Things fell immediately on the but also 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.209
 were obviously the first, 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.040
 completely different weight in contrast to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.390
 predecessor and of course the other 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.060
 pages makes clear in this case 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
 controllers league because just 18 20 me 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.080
 you can tell that pretty much in total 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 I recently broke that with the deceased 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.519
 already said I think I had 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.360
 then installed material just what this 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.970
 g should be 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.890
 under the technology nist called 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.870
 I can not say exactly what that is 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 but it feels like it is 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.660
 frame if you have in hand first 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.580
 easier, of course, easier here too 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.370
 as the predecessor because he was from 335 on 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.540
 315 However, it is not alone 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.230
 but the frame feels very much 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.370
 easy on wins only then 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.989
 stability and weight-lift 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 swing weight if you can do that 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.319
 swing that is then you realize 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.569
 a little weight in the handle you can tell 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.850
 a bit weight in the head but very 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.060
 balanced and feels just like that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.350
 lower weight very maneuverable 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.700
 But if you hit the ball and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.600
 I think it offers as well 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.120
 his name 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.799
 then you develop properly right 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 tinder and that is actually like me 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.739
 me the presentation as the weighting 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.480
 would have to be the professionals 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.000
 I'll give it a bit more 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.380
 I wanted to get to the bottom of it 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
 But ever the knowledge reveal what 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.920
 I can tell you about the racket 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.480
 the new speed pro from djokovic is so 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.340
 something completely different I hope you are 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.690
 a little bit interested in that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.680
 the thing goes out as soon as I you 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.900
 I'll show you that, of course 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.019
 also in this sense until the next 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.019
 times
