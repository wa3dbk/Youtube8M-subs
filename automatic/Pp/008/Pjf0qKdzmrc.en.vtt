with respect to african-americans tell

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.440 
with respect to african-americans tell
us<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> little<00:00:03.179> bit<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.410> how<00:00:05.000> my<00:00:06.000> people<00:00:06.330> are

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
us a little bit about how my people are

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.450 
us a little bit about how my people are
able<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:06.990> some<00:00:07.259> tracing<00:00:07.710> especially<00:00:08.309> when

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
able to do some tracing especially when

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.230 
able to do some tracing especially when
there's<00:00:08.639> such<00:00:08.900> sparse<00:00:09.900> census<00:00:10.830> data<00:00:11.090> prior<00:00:12.090> to

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
there's such sparse census data prior to

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.749 
there's such sparse census data prior to
1870<00:00:12.840> now<00:00:13.559> some<00:00:13.740> things<00:00:13.769> are<00:00:14.009> important<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> me

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
1870 now some things are important to me

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.930 
1870 now some things are important to me
because<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.830> little<00:00:16.940> documentation

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
because there is so little documentation

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.929 
because there is so little documentation
for<00:00:18.330> most<00:00:18.510> African<00:00:19.020> Americans<00:00:19.560> more<00:00:20.310> than<00:00:20.430> 150

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
for most African Americans more than 150

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.570 
for most African Americans more than 150
years<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> things<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
years out and so one of the things that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640 
years out and so one of the things that
we've<00:00:23.730> done<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:24.210> ancestry<00:00:24.689> DNA<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.050> we've<00:00:25.260> gone

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we've done at ancestry DNA is we've gone

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
we've done at ancestry DNA is we've gone
into<00:00:26.070> our<00:00:26.099> big<00:00:26.670> collection<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
into our big collection we have a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
into our big collection we have a
collection<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.050> hundred<00:00:28.260> thousand<00:00:29.039> DNA's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
collection of a hundred thousand DNA's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.519 
collection of a hundred thousand DNA's
from<00:00:29.939> around<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> world<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> freezer<00:00:31.199> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
from around the world in the freezer so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
from around the world in the freezer so
we<00:00:31.650> haven't<00:00:31.800> tested<00:00:32.309> all<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> them<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.660> some

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
we haven't tested all of them but some

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.270 
we haven't tested all of them but some
of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> first<00:00:34.380> ones<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.770> went<00:00:35.010> out<00:00:35.100> for

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of the first ones we went out for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
of the first ones we went out for
testing<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.270> West<00:00:36.480> Africa<00:00:36.950> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
testing we're all from West Africa so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.340 
testing we're all from West Africa so
that<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> major<00:00:39.090> source<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.870> original

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that is the major source of the original

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.799 
that is the major source of the original
transatlantic<00:00:41.100> slave<00:00:41.430> trade<00:00:41.660> bunch<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
transatlantic slave trade bunch of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.470 
transatlantic slave trade bunch of
different<00:00:43.170> countries<00:00:43.410> or<00:00:44.010> areas<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.030> western

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
different countries or areas in western

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
different countries or areas in western
Africa<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.160> modern

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
Africa and so we can look at modern

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.110 
Africa and so we can look at modern
populations<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.930> Africa<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.120> help

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
populations in Africa now and help

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
populations in Africa now and help
African<00:00:51.809> Americans<00:00:52.320> find<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:52.890> where<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:54.030> at

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
African Americans find out where or at

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
African Americans find out where or at
least<00:00:54.239> whose<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.870> related<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.699> in<00:00:56.699> Africa

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
least whose are related to now in Africa

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
least whose are related to now in Africa
and<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.570> been<00:00:57.719> great<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.140> been<00:00:58.320> really

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and it's been great it's been really

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650 
and it's been great it's been really
really<00:00:59.250> enormous<00:00:59.699> ly<00:00:59.910> powerful<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
really enormous ly powerful and one of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
really enormous ly powerful and one of
the<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.320> been<00:01:01.620> able<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the things that I've been able to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.609 
the things that I've been able to
discover<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> most<00:01:03.030> African<00:01:03.480> Americans

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
discover is that most African Americans

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.469 
discover is that most African Americans
have<00:01:04.619> ancestors<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> hail<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.670> two<00:01:06.270> or

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
have ancestors the hail from two or

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.969 
have ancestors the hail from two or
three<00:01:06.750> different<00:01:07.110> parts<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> western<00:01:07.860> Africa

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
three different parts of western Africa

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
three different parts of western Africa
but<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.970> mostly<00:01:09.240> western<00:01:09.540> Africa<00:01:09.950> yes

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but it's mostly western Africa yes

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760 
but it's mostly western Africa yes
almost<00:01:11.549> entirely<00:01:11.880> western<00:01:12.270> Africa<00:01:12.600> yes<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
almost entirely western Africa yes so it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.890 
almost entirely western Africa yes so it
turns<00:01:14.040> out<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.280> African<00:01:14.880> populations<00:01:15.570> have

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
turns out that African populations have

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.840 
turns out that African populations have
the<00:01:16.049> most<00:01:16.350> genetic<00:01:16.860> diversity<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> any

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the most genetic diversity of any

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
the most genetic diversity of any
population<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> world<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.979> fact

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
population in the world and in fact

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.700 
population in the world and in fact
Africa<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.909> very<00:01:21.090> complex<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.110> different

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
Africa is very complex so different

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.010 
Africa is very complex so different
populations<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.490> Africa<00:01:23.810> actually<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.930> quite

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
populations in Africa actually are quite

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
populations in Africa actually are quite
diverse<00:01:25.290> from<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:25.920> another<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.909> give<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> an

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
diverse from one another to give you an

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.390 
diverse from one another to give you an
example<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.350> took<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> population<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
example if you took a population that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
example if you took a population that
was<00:01:29.520> living<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> Kalahari<00:01:30.390> Desert<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
was living in the Kalahari Desert and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
was living in the Kalahari Desert and
compared<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.159> who<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.340> living<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
compared them to one who is living and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
compared them to one who is living and
let's<00:01:33.299> say<00:01:33.479> Mali<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> as

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
let's say Mali they would be as

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
let's say Mali they would be as
divergent<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:35.610> each<00:01:35.790> other<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.299> say<00:01:36.990> an

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
divergent from each other as say an

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
divergent from each other as say an
Italian<00:01:37.680> population<00:01:38.310> from<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> Chinese<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
Italian population from the Chinese so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.760 
Italian population from the Chinese so
there's<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.720> incredible<00:01:40.259> amount<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.740> we

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
there's an incredible amount of what we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
there's an incredible amount of what we
call<00:01:40.890> population<00:01:41.759> structure<00:01:42.119> across

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
call population structure across

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
call population structure across
different<00:01:43.530> groups<00:01:43.619> within<00:01:44.009> Africa<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
different groups within Africa and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.670 
different groups within Africa and
within<00:01:45.210> each<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.689> these<00:01:45.960> groups<00:01:46.290> there's<00:01:46.530> an

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
within each of these groups there's an

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340 
within each of these groups there's an
amazing<00:01:47.009> amount<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.640> genetic<00:01:47.790> diversity<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
amazing amount of genetic diversity so I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
amazing amount of genetic diversity so I
became<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.710> fascinated<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
became really fascinated with it and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.670 
became really fascinated with it and
just<00:01:51.509> curious<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.439> some

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
just curious is there like some

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130 
just curious is there like some
explanation<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.670> wide<00:01:54.030> range<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
explanation for this wide range of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.770 
explanation for this wide range of
diversity<00:01:55.430> right<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.670> one<00:01:57.479> way<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> think

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
diversity right so one way to think

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.560 
diversity right so one way to think
about<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.710> origin<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> modern<00:01:59.939> humans<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
about the origin of modern humans and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
about the origin of modern humans and
the<00:02:00.689> history<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> humans<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.710> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the history of humans and how that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.830 
the history of humans and how that
relates<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> genetics<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
relates to the genetics is to think a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.630 
relates to the genetics is to think a
little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.860> bowl<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> jelly<00:02:05.399> beans

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
little bit about a bowl of jelly beans

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
little bit about a bowl of jelly beans
so<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> bowl<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> jelly<00:02:07.079> beans<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.770> has

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
so you have a bowl of jelly beans it has

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.400 
so you have a bowl of jelly beans it has
a<00:02:08.160> lot<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> different<00:02:08.670> flavors<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> what

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
a lot of different flavors and what

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.170 
a lot of different flavors and what
happens<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:10.890> humans<00:02:11.220> migrated<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
happens when humans migrated is that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.370 
happens when humans migrated is that
their<00:02:12.360> genetics<00:02:12.810> are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
their genetics are

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.720 
their genetics are
actually<00:02:13.650> sort<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.890> sampled<00:02:14.430> from<00:02:14.520> their

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
actually sort of sampled from their

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.520 
actually sort of sampled from their
ancestral<00:02:15.090> population<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.350> were<00:02:16.410> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
ancestral population so if you were to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.800 
ancestral population so if you were to
take<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:16.980> hand<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.430> scoop<00:02:17.790> out<00:02:17.970> some<00:02:18.330> jelly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
take your hand and scoop out some jelly

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
take your hand and scoop out some jelly
beans<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.290> would<00:02:19.410> get<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> subset<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.370> flavors

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
beans you would get a subset of flavors

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.710 
beans you would get a subset of flavors
in<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:20.970> bowl<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.180> wouldn't<00:02:21.570> necessarily

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
in the bowl you wouldn't necessarily

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.830 
in the bowl you wouldn't necessarily
sample<00:02:22.650> every<00:02:23.100> single<00:02:23.490> flavor<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.420> one

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
sample every single flavor with just one

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.750 
sample every single flavor with just one
scoop<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.890> same<00:02:26.100> thing<00:02:26.340> happens<00:02:26.700> with

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
scoop so the same thing happens with

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.580 
scoop so the same thing happens with
human<00:02:27.180> genetics<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> population

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
human genetics if you have a population

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.950 
human genetics if you have a population
that<00:02:29.010> splits<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.210> ancestral<00:02:30.720> group

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
that splits from this ancestral group

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.750 
that splits from this ancestral group
there's<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.500> subset<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.400> genetic

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
there's a subset of the genetic

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.820 
there's a subset of the genetic
diversity<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.330> moves<00:02:33.900> into<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.440> new<00:02:34.560> area

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
diversity that moves into the new area

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.400 
diversity that moves into the new area
and<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:36.060> happened<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.540> humans<00:02:36.960> originated

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
and what happened is humans originated

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.440 
and what happened is humans originated
in<00:02:37.620> Africa<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> subset<00:02:39.420> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
in Africa and then a subset of

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.630 
in Africa and then a subset of
individuals<00:02:40.050> moved<00:02:40.470> into<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.100> Near<00:02:41.280> East<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
individuals moved into the Near East and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.210 
individuals moved into the Near East and
eventually<00:02:42.450> into<00:02:42.900> Europe<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.440> Asia<00:02:43.560> Oceania

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
eventually into Europe and Asia Oceania

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
eventually into Europe and Asia Oceania
but<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:44.910> only<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> small<00:02:45.420> subset<00:02:46.170> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
but it was only a small subset of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.250 
but it was only a small subset of
ancestors<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.910> estimate<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.930> about<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
ancestors so the estimate is about a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140 
ancestors so the estimate is about a
thousand<00:02:49.950> individuals<00:02:50.490> only<00:02:50.820> roughly

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
thousand individuals only roughly

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
thousand individuals only roughly
populated<00:02:52.020> where<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> ancestors<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
populated where the ancestors that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.160 
populated where the ancestors that
populated<00:02:53.490> Europe<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> Asia<00:02:54.450> from<00:02:54.960> many

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
populated Europe and Asia from many

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.720 
populated Europe and Asia from many
thousands<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.740> people<00:02:55.890> who<00:02:56.190> were<00:02:56.310> living<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
thousands of people who were living in

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.720 
thousands of people who were living in
in<00:02:56.880> Africa<00:02:57.660> 50,000<00:02:58.530> years<00:02:58.590> ago<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
in Africa 50,000 years ago so the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.760 
in Africa 50,000 years ago so the
diversity<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.750> indigenous<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
diversity is there is indigenous it is

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.350 
diversity is there is indigenous it is
not<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.160> was<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.490> admixture<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.270> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
not it was not of admixture from the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.690 
not it was not of admixture from the
outside<00:03:03.690> no<00:03:04.110> that's<00:03:04.380> right<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.040> diversity<00:03:05.610> is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
outside no that's right the diversity is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.730 
outside no that's right the diversity is
indigenous<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.450> African<00:03:06.930> populations<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
indigenous in African populations and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.740 
indigenous in African populations and
they've<00:03:07.860> had<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> lot<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.340> time<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.060> move<00:03:09.540> across

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
they've had a lot of time to move across

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.010 
they've had a lot of time to move across
the<00:03:10.020> African<00:03:10.200> continent<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.160> evolve<00:03:11.520> and
