00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.740
 Sooner or later we decide on this 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.719
 bold but very important step which 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.350
 will turn life in separately 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.120
 indoors 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.280
 as you probably guessed it 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.100
 today will go about repairing what is called 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.620
 from scratch or decorating the finished home 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.170
 it is clear that the repair I want to do 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.840
 good beautiful high quality 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.940
 looked expensive and about but 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.720
 time to purse did not beg for 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.910
 mercy 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.340
 so choose a material to imitate 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.890
 marble or skin on the walls and of course 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.900
 apply the whole thing we will do 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.510
 guided by video instructions and 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.120
 be inspired by examples however 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.790
 The question is and where does all this take as they say 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.680
 apple and for this there is an application 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.989
 but that's the question 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.250
 applications for repair almost nothing 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.920
 not disclosed in the appstore 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.320
 but nevertheless something was found domestic 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.360
 development called vincent decor 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 offering to get acquainted not only with 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.140
 an assortment of effects of the same name 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.210
 Franco Russian decor produced 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 by locos but having quite 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.979
 impressive and useful functionality 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 development is unique in many ways 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.790
 near very interesting features 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.130
 distinguishing it from the few 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.250
 competitors that we found on 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.140
 open spaces of the appstore let's watch itself 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.270
 the application is a collection 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.650
 various textures which color 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.930
 user can choose from 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.340
 of the proposed options and try them on 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.260
 the walls of his apartment 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.270
 but everything in order in the first 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.549
 start vincent decor will ask for a bit 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.740
 time to upload the catalog 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.580
 currently available invoices and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.070
 colors 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.990
 size of this directory on ipad now 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 is just over a hundred megabytes 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.740
 but immediately note that in the future 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.720
 developers will add the ability 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.659
 download materials as they appear 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.509
 such need for example through networks 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.610
 3g where wi-fi is not available after 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.140
 the necessary files to load and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.060
 unpack before user 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.610
 the main menu itself will appear 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.799
 application consisting of three elements 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 these are galleries of decorative effects 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.269
 main point 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.159
 Lifestyle and stencils 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.560
 each of them we will go a little more 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.560
 detail the bottom four tabs this 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.920
 catalog 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.130
 my decor is where to buy and extra 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.830
 options go through the first and main 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.330
 catalog about the sheet list available 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.000
 decorative effects applications 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 user can choose the one you like 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.650
 and go directly to the selection of the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.959
 invoices that he thinks fit 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.420
 his apartment has the most selection screen 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.390
 textures are divided into three main parts 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.970
 on the left, the list of textures in the center is large 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.019
 image of the selected effect and to the right 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.920
 color options under the image there 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.709
 multiple tabs 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.810
 this light description required materials 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.730
 video instructions on how to 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.220
 apply material for a specific 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.819
 effect and text description of the process 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.980
 application if the description is clear 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.239
 calculator is very interesting 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.430
 feature of the application 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.500
 here we just enter the area which 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.209
 need to cover about the application itself 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.940
 calculates the cost of materials 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.010
 colorant of and the calculation tool can 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.110
 see how the total acc and cost 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.989
 all positions separately for each position 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.000
 You can find out more if you tap it 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.400
 a window will open with more detailed 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.680
 information application tab too 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.630
 speaks for itself here 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.450
 read on how to apply 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.250
 selected materials 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.380
 back to the first tab except the list 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.600
 decorative effects as I said 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.209
 here are available in the lifestyle section and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.130
 examples of where and how you can 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.230
 so you can 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.930
 borrow some design ideas 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.150
 interiors entirely or partially below 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.500
 for convenience, the name of the invoice is written and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.720
 specific color 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.700
 If you tap on the name of the application 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.829
 will open a tab with effects about which we 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.609
 just said and last this 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.230
 stencils 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.910
 decorative items that you 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.850
 can decorate the walls in that room 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.530
 where are you going to put the invoice however 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.569
 the most interesting in the application to me 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.120
 it seemed possible using the module 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.400
 decorator to estimate before applying 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.769
 how the room will look like after 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.310
 perform all work this tab is my 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.200
 decor 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.900
 in the upper left corner there is a button 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.060
 new thumbnail and a list in the center 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.590
 saved thumbnails you created 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.600
 earlier 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.730
 We will try to create a sketch that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.100
 called from scratch for that we press 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.870
 button a new sketch and choose whether you want 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.750
 we make a new photo or same 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.310
 choose a device from the gallery 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 new photo let's say we want 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.430
 cover the wall of our office with something 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.070
 interesting 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.710
 choose the texture we determine the color and 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.540
 go to the most interesting application 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.300
 virtual decorative effect on 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.160
 wall we stretch the rectangle as 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.650
 we need for this there are purple 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.200
 scarecrow pips indicate the actual size 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.080
 areas horizontally and vertically and 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.300
 double tap to apply the selected texture 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.190
 notice that the application can drive around 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.680
 objects on the walls in respectively if 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.470
 the application will fall under the arm for example 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.600
 painting then paint it on its own 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.520
 I can not say that vincent 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.530
 decor always recognizes correctly 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.229
 foreign objects but in the majority 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.389
 cases everything turns out ok also 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.880
 It is worth noting that the sketch effects 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.110
 applied in real and very 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.060
 high resolution 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.680
 if you bring a sketch to scale 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.530
 real objects in the photo then 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.990
 texture can be seen such what 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.880
 she will after real drawing it 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.610
 very convenient besides rectangles 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.740
 maybe somewhat after we 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.930
 set the sizes we paint over its area 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.789
 You can go to the calculations in order to 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.370
 you just need to know the final price 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.440
 tap the button to do the calculation and we 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.990
 get into the menu similar to the calculator 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.060
 here you can save the calculation send 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.820
 mail it or make directly 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.860
 order required materials tab 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.560
 where to buy you can always find 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.870
 point of sale not far from you and 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.729
 they are available not only in the capital but also in 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.430
 many other cities of Russia 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.510
 and on the last tab you can find 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.669
 building level 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.160
 application settings ask a question 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.320
 developers and read information about 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.180
 companies and application about 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.550
 building level is not worth it 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.919
 rely entirely on it 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.630
 accuracy compared to 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.530
 specialized tools 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.870
 leaves much to be desired 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.260
 this feature of any and device 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.030
 and as a result, vincent and core by 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.730
 the essence of the application is practically 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.010
 unique why yes at least because 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.600
 it has no analogues at all in the appstore 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.780
 application category for decor 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.520
 there are too few rooms but 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.790
 really not that bad you are an example 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.500
 vincent decor is excellent 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.270
 works with a bang and helps users 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.150
 make a solution to the issue of repair and 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.610
 decorating is much easier 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.500
 webstore application is completely free 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.050
 in order to download it scan 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.570
 qr-code on the screen or kill in the search 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.230
 appstore words decor application there 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.230
 in the top three
