out there we're a small town club and I

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.050 
out there we're a small town club and I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
think there's a tendency for perhaps

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.330 
think there's a tendency for perhaps
people<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.570> revel<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.650> down<00:02:41.860> side<00:02:42.190> of

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
