00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.309 

well<00:00:01.770> it<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.220> angle<00:00:02.820> in<00:00:03.000> which<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.929> puck<00:00:04.140> was

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
well it the angle in which the puck was

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.749 
well it the angle in which the puck was
thrown<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.859> everybody<00:00:05.310> thought<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.580> was<00:00:05.670> going

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
thrown in everybody thought it was going

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.120 
thrown in everybody thought it was going
to<00:00:05.819> go<00:00:05.970> around<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.359> boards<00:00:07.340> but<00:00:09.559> in<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:11.099> mind

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
to go around the boards but in my mind

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.870 
to go around the boards but in my mind
and<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.420> their<00:00:13.110> player<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.280> would<00:00:14.700> say

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and that their player was I would say

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210 
and that their player was I would say
one<00:00:15.120> foot<00:00:15.420> ahead<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> Morgan<00:00:16.199> Rielly<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.740> he

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
one foot ahead of Morgan Rielly but he

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.109 
one foot ahead of Morgan Rielly but he
was<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.520> short<00:00:17.880> side<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.199> net<00:00:19.380> and

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
was on the short side of the net and

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.400 
was on the short side of the net and
from<00:00:21.119> where<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.960> thought<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> puck

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
from where we were we thought the puck

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
from where we were we thought the puck
was<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> go<00:00:22.859> around<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
was going to go around and be on the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.310 
was going to go around and be on the
other<00:00:24.210> side<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> net<00:00:24.779> Morgan<00:00:25.170> Rielly

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
other side of the net Morgan Rielly

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.200 
other side of the net Morgan Rielly
would<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.619> been<00:00:25.710> closer<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> puck<00:00:26.460> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
would have been closer to the puck but

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.769 
would have been closer to the puck but
that's<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.599> new<00:00:27.750> rules<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:29.420> that's<00:00:30.420> where

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that's the new rules and that's where

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's the new rules and that's where
it's<00:00:30.929> difficult<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.679> our<00:00:31.830> standpoint

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it's difficult from our standpoint

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
it's difficult from our standpoint
because<00:00:32.430> they're<00:00:32.700> they're<00:00:33.000> making<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
because they're they're making a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.340 
because they're they're making a
decision<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> dot<00:00:34.640> now<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> angle<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
decision at the dot now the angle of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
decision at the dot now the angle of the
puck<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.739> weight<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.190> dumped<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.840> all

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
puck in the weight was dumped in all

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
puck in the weight was dumped in all
those<00:00:40.110> things<00:00:40.520> one<00:00:41.520> explanation<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.360> from

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
those things one explanation i got from

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
those things one explanation i got from
the<00:00:42.629> referee<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.469> he<00:00:43.980> thought

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the referee was is that he thought

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
the referee was is that he thought
Bernie<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.579> wood<00:00:44.969> left<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> net<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> play<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
Bernie a wood left the net to play the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.990 
Bernie a wood left the net to play the
puck<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:48.020> that<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.710> incorrect<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.520> he

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
puck and that was incorrect because he

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
puck and that was incorrect because he
was<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> crease<00:00:51.570> he<00:00:52.410> had<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> his

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
was in the crease he had to be in his

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.580 
was in the crease he had to be in his
net<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> puck<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> deflect<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.350> his

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
net to for the puck to deflect off his

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.810 
net to for the puck to deflect off his
skate<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.329> way<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.570> did<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.820> that's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
skate you know the way it did but that's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
skate you know the way it did but that's
the<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.030> goes<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.530> look

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the way it goes it's you know if I look

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.170 
the way it goes it's you know if I look
at<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> game<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.609> at<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> three

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
at the game and I look at the three

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
at the game and I look at the three
goals<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.379> scored<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
goals that they scored one was a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
goals that they scored one was a
deflection<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.210> our<00:01:06.420> shaft<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.320> one

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
deflection off our shaft the other one

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
deflection off our shaft the other one
was<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.479> shot<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.689> went<00:01:09.780> off<00:01:09.930> Gunnarsson's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
was a shot that went off Gunnarsson's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.859 
was a shot that went off Gunnarsson's
boot<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.340> landed<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.030> Eric<00:01:12.600> Staal's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
boot when landed right on Eric Staal's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
boot when landed right on Eric Staal's
stick<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> third<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.310> was<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.820> all

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
stick and then the third one was we all

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.810 
stick and then the third one was we all
know<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> hockey<00:01:17.310> gods<00:01:17.460> got
