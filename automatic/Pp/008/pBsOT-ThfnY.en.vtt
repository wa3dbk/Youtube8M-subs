00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.280
 are welcome we start with 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.650
 information from the country's capital 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.089
 because today President Barack Obama 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.379
 announces that it expects to send to Congress a 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.850
 proposed immigration reform bill 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.440
 but do not step on the wide 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 at a press conference the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.670
 president obama praised the increase of 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 Latino vote and expressed confidence that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.029
 will be presented at the beginning of 2013 a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.930
 comprehensive immigration reform project 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.940
 villages that must be assured 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.440
 borders should have serious fines 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 for companies that hire and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
 take advantage of undocumented people and I think that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 there should be a way to a status 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 legal for those who live in the country without 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.120
 criminal record added that would include 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.190
 deferred action for young people from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 rimac the president indicated that he is 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.659
 willing to compromise on the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.000
 taxes and prefer not to upload them 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.809
 who earn less than $ 250,000 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.720
 annual 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 Carlos if the congress does not act in order to 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.159
 year the taxes of all 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 will automatically increase is that the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.850
 heritage foundation that opposes 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 tax increase says that if there's no 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.250
 agreement for December 31 the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.290
 taxes will go up between 850 and 4,000 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 dollars for the middle class is ideal 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 violation that we will go to this position 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.450
 and with that he waited too long to deal 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.880
 with that because we're six weeks away from 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 that this diligently but look I think 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.960
 that if you can have to forecast 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.690
 I think from both that they arrived 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.610
 point of commitment on the scandal 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.770
 of infidelity of the former director of the CIA 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.130
 the president said he has no evidence of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.900
 that classified information was disclosed 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.820
 the president spoke loudly in the face of criticism 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 to his government after the attack on 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.750
 American consulate in Libya in 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.460
 September this topic could become 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.050
 in a great conflict for the president 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.119
 here in the capitol in his second 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.710
 period since he told the senators 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.540
 Republicans john mccain and lindsey 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.210
 graham that they would have a personal problem 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.619
 with him if they continue to criticize harshly 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.750
 who could become the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.280
 replacer of hillary clinton like 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.869
 secretary of state the current 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.210
