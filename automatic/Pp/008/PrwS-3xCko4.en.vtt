00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

this<00:00:00.480> will<00:00:01.079> be<00:00:01.230> an<00:00:01.319> example<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.310> slightly

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this will be an example of a slightly

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.260 
this will be an example of a slightly
more<00:00:03.030> difficult<00:00:03.560> checkmate<00:00:04.560> using<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> queen

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
more difficult checkmate using a queen

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.780 
more difficult checkmate using a queen
and<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.629> king<00:00:06.799> against<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.890> king<00:00:08.099> assuming<00:00:08.760> that

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
and a king against a king assuming that

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.790 
and a king against a king assuming that
these<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.510> remaining<00:00:09.960> pieces<00:00:10.349> on<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
these are the remaining pieces on the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.180 
these are the remaining pieces on the
board<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> end<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.730> game<00:00:14.570> basically

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
board at the end of the game basically

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.490 
board at the end of the game basically
the<00:00:17.190> idea<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.609> somewhat<00:00:18.119> similar<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.690> drive

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the idea is somewhat similar to drive

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.660 
the idea is somewhat similar to drive
the<00:00:20.100> King<00:00:20.520> back<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.869> edge<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> board

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
the King back to the edge of the board

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.170 
the King back to the edge of the board
so<00:00:23.670> white<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.660> move<00:00:24.920> comes<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.460> black<00:00:26.880> can

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
so white to move comes here black can

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.029 
so white to move comes here black can
take<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> Queen<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.109> supported<00:00:28.590> by<00:00:28.769> White's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
take the Queen it supported by White's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.229 
take the Queen it supported by White's
King<00:00:30.740> can't<00:00:31.740> move<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.189> any<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.759> squares

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
King can't move to any of these squares

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.229 
King can't move to any of these squares
you'll<00:00:33.600> notice<00:00:33.989> can't<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.700> let's<00:00:36.120> say

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you'll notice can't go here so let's say

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.750 
you'll notice can't go here so let's say
to<00:00:36.750> try<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> stay<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.559> central<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.160> possible

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to try and stay as central as possible

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
to try and stay as central as possible
which<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> always<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> thing<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.260> if

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which is always the thing to do if

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
which is always the thing to do if
you're<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.829> defending<00:00:41.399> position<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.629> goes

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you're the defending position he goes

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.970 
you're the defending position he goes
here<00:00:43.789> now<00:00:44.789> white<00:00:45.090> immediately<00:00:45.899> moves<00:00:46.230> into

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
here now white immediately moves into

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
here now white immediately moves into
this<00:00:47.250> file<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.829> rank

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
this file because now into that rank

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.410 
this file because now into that rank
because<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:50.969> he<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.320> blocked<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.550> King<00:00:54.090> from

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
because now he has blocked the King from

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.350 
because now he has blocked the King from
coming<00:00:54.870> forward<00:00:55.230> again<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.030> king<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
coming forward again so the king is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.619 
coming forward again so the king is
already<00:00:57.690> getting<00:00:57.930> pushed<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.390> King

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
already getting pushed now the King

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
already getting pushed now the King
can't<00:01:00.960> come<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.129> say<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:02.430> goes

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
can't come here so let's say he goes

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.800 
can't come here so let's say he goes
here<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.970> king<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.240> brought<00:01:06.540> up

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
here so now the king is brought up

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
here so now the king is brought up
notice<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.650> White<00:01:07.950> King<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> very

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
notice that the White King is very

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.149 
notice that the White King is very
necessary<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.630> white<00:01:09.930> queen<00:01:10.140> alone<00:01:10.590> can't<00:01:10.950> do

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
necessary the white queen alone can't do

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.660 
necessary the white queen alone can't do
this<00:01:11.340> mate<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:13.890> say<00:01:14.070> he<00:01:14.189> goes<00:01:14.400> back

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this mate so let's say he goes back

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.050 
this mate so let's say he goes back
against<00:01:15.060> trying<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> hang<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> center

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
against trying to hang on to the center

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.170 
against trying to hang on to the center
gets<00:01:18.060> checked<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.810> once<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:19.950> can't<00:01:20.909> go

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
gets checked again once again can't go

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.440 
gets checked again once again can't go
to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> sides<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> retreat<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.360> he

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
to the sides so it has to retreat so he

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.649 
to the sides so it has to retreat so he
goes<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.310> King<00:01:26.310> Again<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> moved<00:01:27.390> up

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
already you have succeeded in forcing

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.889 
already you have succeeded in forcing
him<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.549> edge<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> board<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
him back to the edge of the board and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.910 
him back to the edge of the board and
indeed<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:53.070> where<00:01:53.369> he<00:01:53.579> has<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.920> white

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and back towards the center doesn't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.600 
and back towards the center doesn't
really<00:02:04.200> matter<00:02:04.409> much<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> King

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
