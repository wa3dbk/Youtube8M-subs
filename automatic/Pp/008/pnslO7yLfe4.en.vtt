00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.770
 hello today we are going to cook a plate of 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:23.330
 lentils to lick your fingers 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:25.790
 [Music] 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.619
 as you see lentils that we put yesterday in 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.410
 more swollen waters 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.830
 see the difference between how they were 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.160
 yesterday and how are they today in then for 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.010
 start put to heat in the third 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.510
 is two three glasses of water depends on 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.820
 how juicy you like to do the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.500
 lentils I like that I have a 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.059
 salsita then after three glasses 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 of water can always be rectified 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 after 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.570
 well we put it on the fire with a sheet of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.870
 laurel 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.079
 and the salt to taste good let's cut 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.840
 the ingredients in tacos and carrots 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.809
 then we prepare the onion 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 also cut into thin tacos the same 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.080
 with garlic 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.130
 if we leave everything on a plate with more 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.159
 community after 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.020
 [Music] 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.929
 well we are going to chop the meat 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.060
 wash it before cutting it because always 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.020
 has some sliver of cuts 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.729
 Butcher shop 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.079
 let's get it right in this case 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.079
 we do the same with the rib 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.360
 makes us some pieces to evoke not 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.730
 too much for three ribs the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.060
 we put immunities 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.940
 and we do the same with the bacon in 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.680
 strips rows and then as if 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.100
 they were simple verses 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 [Music] 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.009
 good and finally we cut the sun did 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.400
 I really like the taste we are going to put 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:08.680
 two 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:08.680
 [Music] 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.459
 what 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.600
 or not 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600
 how 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:30.460
 [Music] 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.330
 let's go to the rib now 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:58.520
 etc 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:58.520
 [Music] 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:08.080
 but you need the meat 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.330
 then to the mind of the common project 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.280
 in the environment 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.909
 to the head 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.909
 [Music] 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.499
 and now let's make vegetables 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:35.690
 [Music] 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.020
 we covered the water that had 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.130
 [Music] 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.130
 expired 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.870
 about mixing 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.260
 and we just made the sofrito at 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.260
 onions 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.490
 but he thinks he's a little 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.490
 and now we add the garlic 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.209
 good has reached this point 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.829
 the people who have managed and I like 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.829
 pour a splash of wine 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.050
 the half glass is enough 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.320
 we liked your 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.249
 [Music] 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.969
 let's let it reduce a bit 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:41.339
 and then we incorporate as 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.339
 final part of our lentils 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.760
 something that I like to do the talent that 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.139
 we want to go up to the lentils and that's 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.750
 makes cutting a potato into cubes and 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:18.050
 then breaking into pieces 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:21.449
 [Music] 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.750
 spent 20 25 minutes and this is 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.650
 perfect and as you can see 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.820
