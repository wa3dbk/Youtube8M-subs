00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
should focus on being a good team member

should focus on being a good team member
and<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.639> good<00:04:35.759> person<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.810> really<00:04:37.050> gets

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
and a good person and that really gets

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.650 
and a good person and that really gets
to<00:04:37.349> her<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:38.669> know<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:39.120> was<00:04:39.210> really<00:04:39.389> that

to her and you know that was really that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.779 
to her and you know that was really that
was<00:04:39.690> really<00:04:39.810> deep<00:04:40.199> because<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.280> leader

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
was really deep because a leader

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.330 
was really deep because a leader
shouldn't<00:04:42.720> necessarily<00:04:42.840> be<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:44.039> best

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
shouldn't necessarily be the best

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.570

example in this series is Jean I mean

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.070 
example in this series is Jean I mean
he's<00:04:50.520> obviously<00:04:51.030> not<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.389> best<00:04:51.569> fighter<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080

team juniper but he still assigned the
leader<00:04:54.780> position<00:04:55.500> because<00:04:56.069> of<00:04:56.430> his<00:04:57.270> ability

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389
