00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
than that more than that it gets a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
than that more than that it gets a
little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.520> too<00:01:20.700> crowded<00:01:21.060> however<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> plan

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
little bit too crowded however I do plan

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
little bit too crowded however I do plan
on<00:01:22.200> buying<00:01:22.560> shrink<00:01:23.189> soon<00:01:23.610> where<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.060> make

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
on buying shrink soon where you can make

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.910 
on buying shrink soon where you can make
all<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> apps<00:01:24.780> super<00:01:25.320> small<00:01:25.530> I'd<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
all the apps super small I'd then I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850 
all the apps super small I'd then I
probably<00:01:26.220> put<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.729> unnatural<00:01:27.479> dock<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
probably put more unnatural dock and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
probably put more unnatural dock and
this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> cool<00:01:29.460> way<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.180> folders

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this is a cool way because with folders

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
this is a cool way because with folders
now<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> wanted<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.590> make<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.950> iPhone

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
now if you wanted to make your iPhone

barrel so as you can see it's like the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.819 
barrel so as you can see it's like the
inside<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> Cuba<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.060> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.509> on
