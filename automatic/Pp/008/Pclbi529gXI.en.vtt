00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.780
 the first two men who lived there 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.250
 terra adamo and eva was thus no sense 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 that Adam and Eve are not the ancestors 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.039
 of humanity, Adam and Eve are i 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.350
 founders of one of a particular 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.140
 group 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 I don't know if I call them race agent genes 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.940
 etc. people but they are certainly not i 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.430
 the ancestors of humanity are the two 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 founders they formed first 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.260
 they formed the male because he had to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 work for them in what they do 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 he calls the dog eden, that is, that one 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 which we know as paradise 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.710
 terrestrial and in reality it was them 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.789
 we could call it the command center is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 territory on which the Bible says 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.500
 they have begun to implant all sorts 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.829
 of vegetalia it goes to remove all sorts 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.539
 animals after doing what is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.790
 described starting from the first verse 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.739
 of the genesis that is not creation but 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.280
 they did another thing though 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.200
 for the offenders leave it obviously wings 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.119
 then they brought there they did 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 this male or perhaps this group of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.320
 males to work for them 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.399
 after which he says the bible is 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.119
 realize that there is a term that comes 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.070
 translated variously because that the 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 help oil what is in front of it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 company 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.200
 how to say the animals was not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.569
 enough for the male and here yes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.360
 they could expand then the decide 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.159
 to make it female do the female 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 through that intervention that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.580
 bible clearly describes that if not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.080
 all of us were written in the bible 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.119
 knowing how we would understand that an intervention 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.100
 surgical problem without shadow of 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.929
 doubt but as it is written in the bible 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.329
 it is thought that this is not so but me 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.640
 I pretend instead that instead it is 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.680
 so then everyone must rightly think 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.369
 what the female therefore believes 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.860
 these two begin to reproduce cain 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.390
 and abel and cain kills abel 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.120
 caino is removed from the group 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.470
 tribal and cain says but if you me 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.509
 get everyone out of here 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.640
 will meet kill me and then as 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.140
 if there was nobody before them not 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.000
 could meet anyone 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.080
 and instead Cain finds wives makes children 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.460
 builds cities 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.300
 It is obvious that you do not build it for gods 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.330
 monkeys clearly if we put 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.209
 along with this story with the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.540
 story that continues with the fact that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.670
 elohim boys join at 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.830
 sissies adam pache have seen that 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 they were appealing to them and says the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.810
 bible took it for companies 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.030
 how many they later wanted to happen 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.580
 things that don't like the changes included 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.850
 This did not like and this intersection 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.680
 then they are eliminated and passed to noÃ¨ 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.700
 which instead maintains that my ifs 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.530
 is maintained and we have 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.150
 from archeology to anthropology from 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.470
 in other words anthropology from studies 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.540
 official 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.070
 we know that what appears to be the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.560
 oldest civilization in the world and that 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.549
 Sumerian who suddenly appears already 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.590
 formed without any evolution appears 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.660
 with writing with technology with 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.610
 a wheel with agriculture with the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.540
 knowledge 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.340
 here then we have stories that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.760
 tell us that these have made a 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.130
 group for themselves to this group 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.930
 they gave because necessary 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.720
 they had to work for them so they have 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.080
 given a whole range of knowledge and 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.120
 tools and we have from the studies 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.730
 official a civilization that appears 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 suddenly formed from nothing I 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.510
 I am led to think that Adam and Eve 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.220
 in short, who for them were i 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.570
 founders of what is then 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.570
 become the civilization solera
