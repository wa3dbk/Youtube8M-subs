00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.259
 today I told you about the movie fuji 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.780
 x t1 the latest fuji hybrid movie a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.180
 apparatus a little chameleon because 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 in its appearance had reflex is 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.100
 good of a hybrid camera that he 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.100
 is 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.920
 the xterra two specifics the first 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.869
 its viewfinder is centered as 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.320
 that of reflex which is excellent 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.940
 quality and finally allows you to do without 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.170
 of an optical viewfinder you know there is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.700
 two types of viewfinder there are the viewfinders 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.930
 optics we see through the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.460
 lens that's really what we see at 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.480
 rouvray and there are more and more 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.350
 devices that have viewfinders 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.460
 electronic 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.320
 the problem of electronic viewfinders 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.879
 is that often they were too 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.949
 dark even defined it was difficult to see 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.019
 xt balloons 1 like the two three 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.390
 recent cameras from fuji movie and 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.160
 sony finally offers a goal that is at 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.590
 less equivalent to an optical sight 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.239
 his second strong point is his 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.469
 tropicalized character so what is it 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.149
 does that mean it just wants 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.430
 to say that the device is trimmed a little 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.140
 all seals 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.850
 waterproof and dustproof 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.470
 we will not of course make it fall into 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.690
 water but we can quite get out a 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.789
 big rainy day big wind and it does not 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.740
 will not fear the x trans fuji sensor 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.840
 is a sensor a little different in its 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.460
 design of those of sony olympus and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.020
 consorts they really offer a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
 excellent picture quality we would have 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.470
 liked that fujifilm phase maybe a little 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.600
 more effort to mount in definition 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.660
 but really we really get some 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.700
 beautiful shots especially in the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.830
 colors there is a restitution of the greens 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.090
 trees and flesh tones that is 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.770
 really excellent the second point 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.330
 strong of this device is its optics 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.039
 basic so I say basic optics 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.450
 it's a bit of an insult to him it's not 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.740
 an optical and costs 150 euros as 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.569
 the one you find in SLRs 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.399
 cannon and nikon it's a top optics of 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.440
 metal range that has very good 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.729
 opening f / 2 8 4 for those who 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.289
 know a little bit and who is 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.000
 of excellent design then it's up to 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.340
 to say that the device is a little expensive and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.840
 costs around 1500 euros but that in 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.520
 spending 1500 euros you have both 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.170
 an optic of very good quality and a 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.429
 case of very good quality is not 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.810
 hidden costs at the optical level it 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.340
 is not difficult to determine 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.050
 weak points of the mix t1 because they are 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.940
 overall weak points 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.900
 previous cameras even if fuji movie 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.709
 progress in treatment 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.110
 electronic 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.790
 autofocus is still below this 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.500
 that can propose sony is to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.870
 kilometers of device speed 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.830
 of Olympus and the weaknesses at 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 internal software that is to say that the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.040
 menus of times are not very clear 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.050
 to give you an example I received 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.209
 the device with grids that was 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.250
 displayed in the electronic viewfinder and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.570
 even took a very long time to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.460
 get rid by going into under 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.650
 menu menus so whatever it is 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.630
 autofocus or fauji menus movie has 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.580
 still a little work to do on the side 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.040
 of the software with the xt a fujifilm 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 proposes a device that is mature is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.490
 to say that it's that 3 to the fourth 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.320
 hybrid iteration autofocus 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.330
 we saw it is not very fast but it 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.220
 no longer slow he stays completely 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.590
 operational the device is resistant 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.330
 reinforced it offers pretty much the same 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 comfort than a SLR but it's more 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.800
 little lighter and they really offer 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.170
 excellent image quality with the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.820
 basic little kit we add to that the fact 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.310
 that fujifilm offers excellent 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.830
 fixed focal length that offers quality 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.360
 picture almost unparalleled on this guy 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.440
 hybrid market and we get 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.240
 devices we recommend 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.390
 warmly despite these few little ones 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.390
 defaults
