00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
think maybe that's a little too much

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.039 
think maybe that's a little too much
maybe<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.919> should<00:03:53.159> do<00:03:53.280> 3<00:03:54.150> packs<00:03:54.419> for<00:03:54.629> every<00:03:54.840> 5

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
maybe I should do 3 packs for every 5

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.920 
maybe I should do 3 packs for every 5
games<00:03:55.379> that<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.620> play<00:03:56.069> or<00:03:56.430> maybe<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.750> I

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
games that I play or maybe because I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.809 
games that I play or maybe because I
think<00:03:58.139> one<00:03:58.349> pack<00:03:58.620> for<00:03:58.949> every<00:03:59.159> 5<00:03:59.310> games<00:03:59.609> that's

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
think one pack for every 5 games that's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.879 
think one pack for every 5 games that's
just<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.299> enough<00:04:00.419> but<00:04:01.290> I'm<00:04:01.439> not<00:04:01.560> entirely

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
just not enough but I'm not entirely

just not enough but I'm not entirely

up<00:04:21.090> against<00:04:21.479> people<00:04:21.659> with<00:04:21.870> some<00:04:22.200> slightly

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
up against people with some slightly

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.320 
up against people with some slightly
lower<00:04:22.710> chemistry<00:04:23.219> I'm<00:04:23.520> actually<00:04:23.760> gonna<00:04:24.090> do

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
lower chemistry I'm actually gonna do

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.480 
lower chemistry I'm actually gonna do
relatively<00:04:24.840> well<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.889> think<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.370> would<00:04:26.460> be

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
relatively well so I think that would be

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.780 
relatively well so I think that would be
able<00:04:26.580> to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
able to

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.090 
able to
interesting<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:28.200> know<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.590> thing<00:04:28.980> to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
interesting you know little thing to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.260 
interesting you know little thing to
play<00:04:29.250> around<00:04:29.460> with<00:04:29.610> because<00:04:29.880> if<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.090> think

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
play around with because if you think

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
play around with because if you think
about<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:31.410> know<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.040> really

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
about it you know if I have a really

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.340 
about it you know if I have a really
good<00:04:32.820> nice<00:04:33.180> run<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.690> games<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.140> I<00:04:34.170> get

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
good nice run of games you know I get

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.680 
good nice run of games you know I get
five<00:04:34.620> wins<00:04:34.920> in<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.160> row<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.850> should<00:04:36.390> be<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.630> know

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
five wins in a row I should be you know

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.060 
five wins in a row I should be you know
I<00:04:36.780> should<00:04:37.020> kind<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.230> be<00:04:37.320> rewarded<00:04:37.800> for<00:04:37.830> that

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
I should kind of be rewarded for that

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.310 
I should kind of be rewarded for that
and<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.430> guess<00:04:38.610> if<00:04:38.790> I<00:04:38.880> can<00:04:39.060> open<00:04:39.390> up<00:04:39.480> five<00:04:39.990> packs

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
and I guess if I can open up five packs

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.810 
and I guess if I can open up five packs
I<00:04:40.530> think<00:04:40.710> that'd<00:04:40.830> be<00:04:40.980> awesome<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.520> load<00:04:41.670> on

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
I think that'd be awesome I just load on

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.360 
I think that'd be awesome I just load on
some<00:04:42.030> fifa<00:04:42.270> points<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.660> do<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:42.930> way<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
some fifa points and do it that way and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.260 
some fifa points and do it that way and
yeah<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.520> way<00:04:44.640> we<00:04:44.670> can<00:04:44.910> have<00:04:44.970> some<00:04:45.150> nice

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
yeah that way we can have some nice

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270 
yeah that way we can have some nice
players<00:04:45.540> going<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.710> overall<00:04:47.040> just

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
players going on and I overall just

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.500 
players going on and I overall just
think<00:04:47.430> it'd<00:04:47.520> be<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.640> fun<00:04:47.880> little<00:04:48.000> thing<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.300> do

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
think it'd be a fun little thing to do

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.720 
think it'd be a fun little thing to do
but<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.290> course<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.770> guys<00:04:49.890> did<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> deciders

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
but of course you guys did the deciders

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.000 
but of course you guys did the deciders
and<00:04:50.880> let<00:04:51.690> me<00:04:51.780> know<00:04:51.870> in<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:51.990> comments<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.560> we

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and let me know in the comments but we

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.590 
and let me know in the comments but we
are<00:04:53.280> looking<00:04:53.640> at<00:04:53.790> some<00:04:53.970> center<00:04:54.330> backs<00:04:54.480> I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
are looking at some center backs I

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.630 
are looking at some center backs I
wanted<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.900> improve<00:04:55.260> my<00:04:55.530> center<00:04:56.280> bags<00:04:56.460> I

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
wanted to improve my center bags I

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.790 
wanted to improve my center bags I
currently<00:04:56.970> have<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.570> one<00:04:58.050> gold<00:04:58.260> centre<00:04:58.500> back<00:04:58.650> on

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
currently have a one gold centre back on

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.170 
currently have a one gold centre back on
one<00:04:58.980> bronze<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.430> wanted<00:04:59.640> to<00:04:59.730> get<00:04:59.850> rid<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.060> that

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
one bronze I wanted to get rid of that

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.580 
one bronze I wanted to get rid of that
bronze<00:05:00.450> side<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:00.990> we're<00:05:01.110> currently<00:05:01.230> going

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
bronze side and we're currently going

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.200 
bronze side and we're currently going
for<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.800> bit<00:05:01.890> of<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.070> Bundesliga<00:05:02.700> side<00:05:02.880> as<00:05:03.060> well

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
for a bit of a Bundesliga side as well

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.120 
for a bit of a Bundesliga side as well
at<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.420> moment<00:05:03.510> but<00:05:04.080> I<00:05:04.110> love<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.830> shadow

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
at the moment but I love that shadow

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.680 
at the moment but I love that shadow
chemistry<00:05:05.700> style<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> put<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.390> in<00:05:06.600> the

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
chemistry style so I put that in the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.450 
chemistry style so I put that in the
filter<00:05:06.990> unfortunately<00:05:07.800> there<00:05:07.950> wasn't<00:05:08.160> a

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
filter unfortunately there wasn't a

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.670 
filter unfortunately there wasn't a
centre<00:05:09.270> back<00:05:09.300> who<00:05:09.780> had<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.990> shadow<00:05:10.200> chemistry

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
centre back who had the shadow chemistry

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.620 
centre back who had the shadow chemistry
style<00:05:10.920> who<00:05:11.280> was<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:11.670> know<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.120> decent<00:05:12.540> price

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.910 
as you can see I'm only got 877 coins I
feel<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.480> poor<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:15.900> worthless<00:05:16.380> and<00:05:16.530> peasant

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
feel so poor and worthless and peasant

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.250 
feel so poor and worthless and peasant

Lee but you know you got a star everyone

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.750 
Lee but you know you got a star everyone
starts<00:05:19.530> off<00:05:19.710> this<00:05:19.860> way<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.310> just<00:05:20.430> kind<00:05:20.640> of

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
starts off this way and you just kind of

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.480 
starts off this way and you just kind of
got<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.630> work<00:05:21.870> with<00:05:22.050> things<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.590> yeah<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.280> had

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
got to work with things and yeah I had

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.650 
got to work with things and yeah I had
to<00:05:23.610> change<00:05:23.790> that<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.000> decided<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.390> change<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.600> up

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
to change that I decided to change it up

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.450 
to change that I decided to change it up
to<00:05:24.780> anchor<00:05:25.170> see<00:05:25.380> if<00:05:25.470> there<00:05:25.620> was<00:05:25.710> any<00:05:25.860> possible

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
to anchor see if there was any possible

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.560 
to anchor see if there was any possible
ones<00:05:26.640> that<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:26.850> get<00:05:26.970> for<00:05:27.120> an<00:05:27.210> anchor<00:05:27.420> but

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
ones that you get for an anchor but

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.420 
ones that you get for an anchor but
again<00:05:27.810> they<00:05:28.230> were<00:05:28.350> all<00:05:28.500> relatively<00:05:28.980> expensive

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
again they were all relatively expensive

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.010 
again they were all relatively expensive
and<00:05:29.850> weren't<00:05:30.090> really<00:05:30.300> my<00:05:30.420> style<00:05:30.600> but<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.810> did

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
and weren't really my style but I did

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.160 
and weren't really my style but I did
put<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.230> bid<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:32.310> Western<00:05:32.970> of<00:05:33.450> Westermann<00:05:34.050> is

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
put a bid on a Western of Westermann is

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.230 
put a bid on a Western of Westermann is
it<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.470> Wasserman<00:05:35.130> something<00:05:35.490> like<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.820> I<00:05:35.940> had

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
it a Wasserman something like that I had

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.910 
it a Wasserman something like that I had
him<00:05:36.360> back<00:05:36.510> in<00:05:36.660> FIFA<00:05:36.930> 13<00:05:36.960> when<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.470> did<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.710> storm

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
him back in FIFA 13 when I did a storm

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.140 
him back in FIFA 13 when I did a storm
from<00:05:38.070> scratch<00:05:38.250> he<00:05:38.400> was<00:05:38.490> actually<00:05:38.640> pretty<00:05:39.030> good

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
from scratch he was actually pretty good
