00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
try and cut this in a way that you just

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.700 
try and cut this in a way that you just
kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> cut<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.329> diagonal<00:01:45.869> angles

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
kind of cut to little diagonal angles

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.859 
kind of cut to little diagonal angles
you're<00:01:47.130> trying<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> leave<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.240> Apple

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you're trying to leave the Apple

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.469 
you're trying to leave the Apple
together<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> whole<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.970> you're<00:01:51.119> trying<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
together as a whole but you're trying to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.920 
together as a whole but you're trying to
take<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:52.049> slice<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.329> Apple<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
take a little slice out of the Apple and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.160 
take a little slice out of the Apple and
this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.799> makes<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.399> open<00:01:57.060> mouth<00:01:57.509> shape

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this is what makes the open mouth shape

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.740 
this is what makes the open mouth shape
so<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> top<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.640> bottom<00:02:00.119> lips<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so you have the top and bottom lips this

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.209 
so you have the top and bottom lips this
can<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.259> bit<00:02:01.409> tricky<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> first

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
can be a little bit tricky and the first

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.550 
can be a little bit tricky and the first
time<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.600> okay<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
time that you do it it is okay if you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.789 
time that you do it it is okay if you
cut<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.070> two<00:02:05.460> slices<00:02:06.439> separately<00:02:07.439> because

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
cut these two slices separately because

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
cut these two slices separately because
the<00:02:08.039> peanut<00:02:08.459> butter<00:02:08.610> will<00:02:09.149> hold<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.780> top<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the peanut butter will hold the top and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
the peanut butter will hold the top and
bottom<00:02:10.560> lip<00:02:10.979> together

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
bottom lip together

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.720 
bottom lip together
a<00:02:12.420> catastrophe<00:02:12.770> if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.920> cut<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.460> like

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a catastrophe if you cut it into like

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
a catastrophe if you cut it into like
