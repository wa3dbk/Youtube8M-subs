00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.139
 yes 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.780
 hello is bananas welcome to the analysis 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.389
 from the lego movie the video game 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.029
 obviously for 3ds we are here 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.160
 we started in the phase already started because 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.600
 we are in one of the novelties one of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.019
 the minigames that are included by 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.550
 first time in this in a layman and they are the 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.769
 mini game of the constructions of the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.159
 master builders that for this there 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.509
 to find throughout the phase 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.950
 different different instructions to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.810
 times there were three that is to say five 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.880
 So, in order not to bore you, we bring you 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.860
 directly what are these 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.750
 instructions as you see are the typical 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.590
 of a lego game so let's go 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.590
 make the constructions 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.170
 then we will do the rest of the game but 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.590
 well here we are doing one of the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.590
 news 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.899
 and this you see super fast but 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 I really already tell you that you have to go 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.860
 the entire phase to find all the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.380
 instructions then what are we going to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.380
 to do is now when we can 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.140
 level completed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.410
 well the game consists of 15 chapters 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.320
 each chapter is divided into three 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.900
 phases really the best of all is that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.570
 the phases are very different between them 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.110
 we will have phases of action we will have 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.850
 other phases of platforms we will have 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 phases of for example we can drive 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 cars we have characters very is so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.220
 bizarre there really is a lot 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.600
 variety 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.960
 for those of you who have seen the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.119
 movie you will see that it looks like a lot 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.190
 really from the cinematics that are from 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.570
 the movie will not surprise you without 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.490
 But the characters themselves that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 they include everyone in the games are almost 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.430
 all but not all so let's see 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.430
 some of the phases 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.750
 here we have one of the most 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.240
 fun but we're going to start being 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 the kinematics so you can see that it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.780
 You can see at the moment that you have 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.920
 completed the phase you can see the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 cinematic let's see anything 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.670
 certainly as the truth is bent and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 not like for example Lord of the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.480
 rings' was folded in Spanish and it's 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 in Spanish 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.450
 is already and I say every time 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 complete each of the phases that is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.540
 what you will do the video you can see in 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.640
 the moment that you want like all the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.459
 legos there are different characters for 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 unlock you already know that the phases in 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.549
 the story mode and things complete 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 in the order and with the characters that you 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.329
 they say however in free mode 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.310
 you can take the character you want from 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.319
 fact must choose the characters that 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.000
 you have unlocked to be able to do 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.310
 all the challenges the challenges you see 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.500
 here on the top screen not all 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.420
 you can complete them with the characters 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.890
 of the story mode so you will need 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.109
 then enter the free mode to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.430
 continue unlocking different 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.600
 parts of the game 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 really loading times 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 normal are not too high 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.590
 they are not for example as lego city that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.030
 they were really horrible good here 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.630
 we are with one of the characters 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.370
 funny that is a kitten the sea ​​of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.340
 fun this super happy 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.900
 she has her diabolical part as 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.480
 always in the laymen well you know 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.069
 you have to break most of the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 constructions good here we see that 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.980
 we can choose different characters 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.900
 we can do it with the triggers lr 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.540
 or if we want we can do it through 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 of the touch screen we select and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.750
 then we can choose the character 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.640
 that suits us according to the situation 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.560
 right now we see that with this character 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.150
 we can not break what we can 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.520
 interact with this why we have 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.760
 to change character and we say to the 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.760
 little cat 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.299
 diabolical kitten you can do the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.959
 action with buttons with a button on 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.959
 button to forgiveness or simply with the 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.269
 touch screen and as always when it 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.750
 move the pieces there are to interact with 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.600
 they 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.070
 here you see that it is a super happy world its 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.990
 Javi time with rainbow and pretty 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.600
 I already tell you there are phases of all 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.280
 times is something that everyone will like 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.640
 world because that way you do not get tired of being 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.500
 all the time actions of the same 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.640
 in an action phase where we will take 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.770
 a stroller and it has to be said that it is not 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.040
 like other legos where for example if 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.110
 we died because nothing dies and you go back to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.940
 revive and nothing happens not here without 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.120
 women you have to start again the 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.120
 phase 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.100
 let's take the phase 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.410
 the stroller as always each with 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.570
 his videos we choose the character that 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.570
 we want since we are in free mode 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.199
 and I tell you to complete the story 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.680
 main will take us around 5 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.629
 or 6 hours is not not too long already 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.150
 complete everything because it can take you 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.219
 then 8 or 10 hours depends on what 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.379
 you want to make the game is good is 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.990
 good entertaining but obviously not 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.420
 has the quality of staff of 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.060
 After dinner that's the normal thing about heros 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.610
 practically therefore typical of the laymen to 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.220
 times sawtooth good the typical 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.980
 the 30 scale effect I do not either 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:51.560
 contributes nothing really is very little 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.180
 just really once by adicae 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.240
 at the platform station where we 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.460
 we saw some of the 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.260
 good phases now is a moment where 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.330
 we go back to restart from the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.600
 crashed so you can see that we 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.600
 we die 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.249
 we have left without believing 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.440
 to know how we have lives and there is no 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.440
 to spend what they said 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.900
 really, it's a typical layman, no no 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.900
 he has no more 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.070
 the novelty I already tell you is exactly what 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.100
 of constructions novelty more or 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.480
 less novelty those eddies although not 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.860
 that first game that happens with 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.540
 more of nerves was already happening that if we 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.840
 we died because we had as initial 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.840
 level 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.320
 as you see then nothing 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.060
 you will find characters because very 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:56.630
 varied the typical of the movie 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.630
 batman superman these are crimes 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:05.370
 a normal game a lego more ya tell you 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.670
 that the pity is that it is not so 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.900
 good as the version of 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.580
 of desktop but good is not bad anymore 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.560
 you know Spartans that we see ourselves with the 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.870
 social networks that go for 3ds 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.460
 facebook to share with Instagram 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.130
 bars for three times you have the 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.490
 youtube channel of spalding and how we 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.670
 we see with the spa forums 3ds.com bye 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.670
 bye
