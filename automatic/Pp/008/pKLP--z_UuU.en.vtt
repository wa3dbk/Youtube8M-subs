00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.819
 and then people accompanying my channel and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.450
 Talking mania here is a jewel 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.550
 doc 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.490
 I'm bringing a boxing of a power today. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.410
 to force that oh I know he 's a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.440
 spoon as if it were water only 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.090
 sealed there a shrink who does not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 maintenance 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.160
 this is that he exactly of 300 reais 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 in the free market and has a little radio 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 greater than the other who believes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 little cheaper then we're going to leave 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 with a boxing 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.880
 So let's start making a boxing 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.149
 cunene well sealed all in plastic 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.489
 in case I bought it on amazon's website 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:47.700
 he is doing here that he serves nine 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 bridge 17h 77 b7 of 5 than models that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.539
 Come on, let's go. Let's go. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.539
 take this classic that opened healing 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.700
 I 've been researching the free market. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.979
 the price of that harvested boy for $ 300 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.270
 they think they're spoonful until it's cheap 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.649
 a cooler is unconventional and everything in the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.509
 Brazil is absurd that was the reason for 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.570
 I have found it cheap and we will see that a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.570
 day that deal opens that opens 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.750
 I think she could have given it here. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 open here then let's open this way 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:54.119
 and here opening it but back own 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.320
 it here because there with 21 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.909
 I took a paper talking about the products of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 force hd healing ssd 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:16.500
 he comes with a pouch and instructions on how to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:19.080
 install and other and a warning of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.790
 chemical harmful to health 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.070
 it came in our heavy cures with 2 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.610
 spoons 12 volts 0 35 stones of 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.610
 very heavy passage 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.299
 it has all the screws and needed 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 he saw with the base is placed underneath 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:56.450
 of motherboard motherboard and a business 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.450
 anti-mold had the radiator 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.490
 already of the jet already embedded in the cooler 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740
 So the staff and loot and everything I saw 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.770
 in the core of the color sar 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.770
 he came a radiator that radiator here 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.880
 he wins radiator 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.960
 already with the hoses embedded in the base 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.580
 of the processor it sees these irons that is 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.130
 one is the base that goes from under the plate 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.570
 mother and the other do not know what the manuals 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.340
 here and 2 wedges because you scoop and a half 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.650
 heavy when you take a look at it 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.600
 colonel common including 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.540
 conventional he came he's a cooler 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.850
 that he has bearing between Anthony 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.900
 longer autonomy and durability 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.410
 also then certainly are 300 reais 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.120
 well paid and then I went back here 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.830
 I'm showing the computer here and there. 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.650
 is the basis of the processor where we 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.060
 Let's dismount on the motherboard. It's changing. 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.190
 that's right 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.610
 here is my video card 67 70 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.170
 Your company is changing her here. 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.420
 is my source of celma 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.370
 zm 1,250 platinium she is the best 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.640
 The source you have in the market is 80 plus 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.070
 platinum there dall'antonia of 93% 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.470
 here plus the right side we have three is 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.390
 four hds of 1tb terabyte 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.750
 but why do you talk like that because you 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.140
 has much space is for four 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.160
 hds and a job because it is the following 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.780
 here we have a hd with hd ssd docked 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.800
 here above it has a pattern that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.380
 get here oh hds acdc of 256 gb but 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:44.320
 because both the chain because the following 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.060
 mine is my black capture box 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.560
 intensive mexico very aggravating an 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.630
 maximum quality a normal hard disk and 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.380
 to the system and another to write data 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.840
 it does not support the speed of black 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.050
 doctor is very tall and hd does not give 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.370
 why use 4 the head because it uses 4 to 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.910
 head face and working on a system 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.010
 called raid is you can work on us 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.180
 four hds at the same time how is it 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.190
 this works 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.410
 each full and medium file that commands 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.190
 the system divides it into four parts 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.940
 then every hd she is she stays responsible 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.889
 for saving 25% of each file that 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.870
 I say to them then it is one unit 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.060
 all four units 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.550
 only that everything I say / from 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.440
 divided into four pieces then the 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.340
 four times faster 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.650
 and reading it too and usb usb for it 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.139
 type is so if he has the time to 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.900
 very high response so he can 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.550
 a rapid response to after the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.320
 socks to head that could engrave 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.880
 So the father, this is the 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.340
 computer demonstration I go back 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.310
 Dismounting him here I'll be back soon 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.570
 for bringing it already assembled all 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.870
 working here it's okay 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:02.560
 I'll be back, and I'll have to 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.270
 after a few hours it is not 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.520
 I do not have to install fast and 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.729
 spoon because I had to do some 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.000
 adaptations in my computer's case 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:16.060
 because if I put in the water in the 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.740
 Office blooms could not 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.680
 the cooler was that it ran into the 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.130
 memories on the top of this 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.460
 top part said pink the whips of 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.830
 hang cats to be able to learn 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.240
 spoon on top and used screw 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.789
 on the bottom 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.440
 So I put two screens of these 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.080
 screens does not come with colleague eu 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.550
 I put it as optional to be able to 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.180
 be holding some of the dust in there 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:47.620
 so there the cooler is here in this part 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.360
 where are you programming me? 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.130
 Speed ​​of the cooler only I preferred 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.229
 did not do much then he 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.800
 practically non-automatic speed 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:07:00.460
 processor cooler temperature 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.320
 is evaluating several ranging by 35 in 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.870
 33 to 35 degrees so far 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.190
 so I'll do tests here to see 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.440
 any temperature in any 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.449
 temperature and safety compensator but 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.979
 I will not go there for not voting 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.009
 I do not have software to do this 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.860
 Now I close my video. 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:23.400
 and I hope you have enjoyed my 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.369
 and from my box dokolo spoon force the 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.189
 gacen and showing it mounted on the 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:31.979
 computer is working, so I'm going to 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.960
 here and if you liked this video here 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.490
 for a video liquid and do not 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.529
 forget to write my channel for you 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.860
 is following the next videos 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.599
 We 'll have another box there soon. 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.059
 this depends greatly on the amount of 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.659
 likes subscribed up to 

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:47.659
 went
