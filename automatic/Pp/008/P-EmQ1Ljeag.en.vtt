00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
the cow dung into energy which is

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.720 
the cow dung into energy which is
methane<00:00:52.850> gas<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.079> had<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.230> simple<00:00:54.679> system<00:00:55.129> the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
methane gas so had a simple system the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.450 
methane gas so had a simple system the
first<00:00:56.030> dung<00:00:56.359> they<00:00:56.629> put<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:56.989> into<00:00:57.499> the<00:00:57.620> mixer

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
first dung they put it into the mixer

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.459 
first dung they put it into the mixer
the<00:00:58.999> simple<00:00:59.390> mixer<00:01:00.999> you<00:01:01.999> turn<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.479> till<00:01:03.379> it

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
the simple mixer you turn it till it

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.730 
the simple mixer you turn it till it
becomes<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.920> beautiful<00:01:04.100> slurry<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:06.470> open

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
becomes a beautiful slurry and you open

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.070 
becomes a beautiful slurry and you open
the<00:01:06.860> gate<00:01:07.040> it<00:01:07.250> goes<00:01:07.490> into<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.720> chamber

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the gate it goes into the the chamber

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.820 
the gate it goes into the the chamber
you<00:01:10.570> leave<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:11.990> nature<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.620> course

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
you leave it to the nature to the course

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.880 
you leave it to the nature to the course
and<00:01:13.100> hits<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.200> produces<00:01:15.200> methane<00:01:15.470> gas

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
and hits it up and produces methane gas

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.190 
and hits it up and produces methane gas
it<00:01:16.400> fills<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.850> ER<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.660> drum

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
it fills the ER the drum

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.920 
it fills the ER the drum
so<00:01:18.500> here's<00:01:18.710> Tom<00:01:19.070> about<00:01:19.190> 10<00:01:19.580> 20<00:01:19.880> 50<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.570> about

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
so here's Tom about 10 20 50 and about

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.010 
so here's Tom about 10 20 50 and about
10<00:01:21.260> feet<00:01:21.440> diameter<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.970> gas<00:01:23.150> fills<00:01:23.480> some<00:01:23.720> it

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
10 feet diameter the gas fills some it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.770 
10 feet diameter the gas fills some it
goes<00:01:24.230> up<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:25.400> gas<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:25.820> finished<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.300> comes<00:01:26.510> on

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
goes up the gas is finished it comes on

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.340 
goes up the gas is finished it comes on
it<00:01:27.080> gives<00:01:27.410> about<00:01:27.680> five<00:01:28.070> six<00:01:28.460> hours<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.090> energy

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
it gives about five six hours of energy

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.890
