00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.339
 hello girls then I'm back 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.909
 today for a new video 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.570
 this time dedicated to care 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.660
 capillaries 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.480
 so when it's the weekend I do 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.230
 will enjoy it for pampering 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:31.990
 my hair and for that I decided to 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:38.290
 to make a mask the fact based on from to 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:42.130
 basis nor the other and powder 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:46.420
 grami so for the one who follow me 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:51.899
 you have probably already seen in that my 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:57.820
 last video dedicated to the hall by the way 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.420
 that I did from November where I 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.729
 so you talked about this powder of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.299
 bram i to the fact who's who who who 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.290
 promote the growth of hair and 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.049
 neutral henna chi chi and that brings 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.000
 strength shine and volume to the hair 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.970
 so what I'm going to do is I 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.770
 am going to mix both the two 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:32.560
 powders and I'm going to add oil 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.010
 castor oil castor by the way 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.740
 this oil accelerates the growth and therefore 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.799
 volume 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.909
 I also put oil 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:49.090
 essential of grapefruit which as for 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.180
 it strengthens the hair and slows down its 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.410
 fall and finally a little oil oil 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.250
 Rosemary essential that 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:03.520
 kiki and is an anti dandruff so we 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.690
 will start preparing my 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:11.590
 mask ah yes never forget the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.520
 girls like when you make a mask 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.610
 henna-based never use 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 metal utensils always either in 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 plastic be wooden so I'm going 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:38.880
 take my nose and is neutral and I 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 will take three spoons of henna 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.860
 more then I'll take two 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.860
 powder spoons of bram i 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:18.580
 he shows himself how this style so there 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 I will add I add oil 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:40.330
 of castor so a spoon of oil from 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:44.709
 castor or a little bit more be generous killed 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.330
 then put a few drops of 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:55.180
 essential oil grapefruit 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:59.280
 5 grapefruit and 5 milk 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.280
 essential rosemary and range 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.780
 then I mix the preparation well 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:22.730
 and I take water in hot water 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.730
 not boiling and I pour little appetite 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:51.099
 it gives that so we can see that he 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:55.330
 lack of water so I add a little 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.909
 of water I'm careful that it does not 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.830
 not too liquid but the dough does not 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.830
 must not be too thick 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:14.979
 it should have the consistency of a 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:19.749
 dune of a fresh cream we will say so 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.349
 that that gives it that I think it's 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:26.939
 still too much pasty so I'm going 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.939
 add a little more water 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:06:06.490
 I'm starting to take shape 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:09.630
 see then you can for for them 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.100
 oils by the way you can put 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.280
 any oil of oil 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.840
 olive avocado oil finally all this 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.550
 that everything that goes through your head 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:26.230
 the same for essential oils but 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:32.440
 me like there I would like to grow 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:35.610
 my games and from where the bram powder i 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.390
 added castor oil which is also 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:42.420
 known to speed up the growth of 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.420
 hair 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.050
 here I think I found the bank 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.050
 consistency 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.760
 so here are the girls I'll leave 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.220
