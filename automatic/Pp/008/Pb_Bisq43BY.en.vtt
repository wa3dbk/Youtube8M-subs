00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.609
 Sooner or later, your child will lose the tie due to lack of snow 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.669
 but the knot is not sitting 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.439
 no wonder if you only put on the tie and is not 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.439
 do how to tie a knot 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429

 Vienna simple tie knot 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.020
 Now, the most versatile tie knot is any 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.360
 Kind of shirt collar 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.270
 The length would be important if we were with Virgin 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.910
 this depends on the type of tie secured 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.210
 if they manage 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.190
 Goal came 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.410
 10 cm and the concept survive the long end about the short life 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.410
 just suggest 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.510
 this could 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.510
 and pull a flank through the streets 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.500
 AFP 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.620
 15 o'clock the tie knot tight after the tie freezing is on 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.450
 the collar 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.560
 he should fix relatively because with 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 no distance between collar 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.490
 and tie knots destined 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.530
 Further questions should be the number of the second half 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 thanks to lead at the sites 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 he has no baton Dekker from Holland 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.049
 The little girl injured such a long time has not kicked 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.220
 the short end do not have it 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.020

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.510
 Endangered is easy to maintain "The knot becomes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.710
 as a rule of thumb for the amount of money, of course 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.010
 not to short 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 but the cards played should be about on with the cooks m 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.800
 that would be the perfect wave 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.430
 for a perfect comes her luck there is still a small club 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 have played the matching pocket handkerchief 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.800
 and a send to Tuesday is no longer in the air 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.679
 In the next installment of the Breuninger Card series, they've seen them here quite like them 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.229
