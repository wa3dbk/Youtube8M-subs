the rest of the house that it is

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.290 
the rest of the house that it is
probably<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.010> new<00:03:55.459> owner<00:03:55.610> would<00:03:55.880> probably<00:03:56.180> want

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
probably a new owner would probably want

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.330 
probably a new owner would probably want
to<00:03:56.390> reconfigure<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.020> first<00:03:57.380> floor<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:57.920> more

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
to reconfigure the first floor for more

to reconfigure the first floor for more
contemporary<00:03:58.820> use<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.420> we<00:03:59.660> looked<00:03:59.840> around<00:04:00.080> it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
contemporary use and we looked around it

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.750 
contemporary use and we looked around it
would<00:04:00.380> be<00:04:00.440> possible<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.400> absolutely

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
would be possible to do that absolutely

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.820 
would be possible to do that absolutely
where<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.570> is<00:04:02.690> because<00:04:02.930> servants<00:04:03.410> were<00:04:03.530> using

where it is because servants were using
it<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.160> can<00:04:04.310> easily<00:04:04.640> pull<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.360> forward<00:04:05.810> in

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
it but you can easily pull it forward in
