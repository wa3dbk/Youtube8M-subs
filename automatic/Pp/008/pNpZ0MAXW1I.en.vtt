relevant<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.319> it<00:01:47.409> rains<00:01:47.619> booked<00:01:47.920> yeah<00:01:48.340> and

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
relevant if is it rains booked yeah and

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.889

think<00:01:48.939> what<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.119> could<00:01:49.329> do<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.569> could<00:01:49.600> have

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
think what you could do you could have

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.440 
think what you could do you could have
twenty20<00:01:50.530> right<00:01:51.369> away<00:01:51.579> there<00:01:51.880> are<00:01:52.030> all<00:01:52.149> sorts

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
twenty20 right away there are all sorts

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.880 
twenty20 right away there are all sorts
of<00:01:52.509> possibilities<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.439> I<00:01:53.499> think<00:01:53.679> they<00:01:53.770> should

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
of possibilities and I think they should

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.590 
of possibilities and I think they should

yeah<00:02:49.109> really<00:02:49.230> good<00:02:49.379> question<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.739> thought<00:02:49.889> that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
yeah really good question I thought that

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.559 
yeah really good question I thought that
because<00:02:50.189> he<00:02:50.280> he<00:02:50.519> padded<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:50.939> a<00:02:50.969> Slugger<00:02:51.239> in

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
because he he padded like a Slugger in

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.679 
because he he padded like a Slugger in
this<00:02:51.840> innings<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.859> might<00:02:53.450> jump<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.569> that

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
this innings and you might jump to that

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.179 
this innings and you might jump to that
conclusion<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.349> actually<00:02:55.709> he<00:02:55.799> came<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.129> with

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
conclusion but actually he came in with

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.890 
conclusion but actually he came in with
the<00:02:56.280> score<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.639> worth<00:02:56.790> 400<00:02:57.359> for<00:02:57.510> three<00:02:57.750> or

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the score was worth 400 for three or

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.470 
the score was worth 400 for three or
something<00:02:58.109> ridiculous<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.950> he<00:02:59.220> batted<00:02:59.730> for

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
something ridiculous and he batted for

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.059 
something ridiculous and he batted for
the<00:03:00.569> team<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:01.650> ever

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069

and what Williamson couldn't hit the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.420 
and what Williamson couldn't hit the
ball<00:03:03.870> off<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.019> square<00:03:04.349> before<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.980> chest

McCullum<00:03:05.879> spoke<00:03:06.120> about<00:03:06.389> the<00:03:06.569> aggressive

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
McCullum spoke about the aggressive

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
McCullum spoke about the aggressive
style<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.349> cricket<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.680> they<00:03:07.799> play<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.280> he

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
style of cricket that they play and he

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.830 
style of cricket that they play and he
said<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.030> earn<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.659> be

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.869 
said you have to earn the right to be
aggressive<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.439> I<00:03:10.530> think<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.919> this<00:03:11.040> case<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
aggressive and I think in this case the

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.629 
aggressive and I think in this case the
team<00:03:12.209> had<00:03:12.569> earned<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:13.109> him<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:14.129> right<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.519> be

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639
