 did not even have time to notice anything 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.229
 that was a little different and Ana 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.490
 the idea of doing what she most 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:03.179

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.619
 at nights she dreamed she had the courage 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.420
 to do what she liked best 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:17.870

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.660
 but one day two artists came from far 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.440
 to visit Ana's city 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.319

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.550

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.700

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.390

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.709

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.140
 more than a simple booty and 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.810
 creative idea then solved

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.989
 we were finishing touches to ushering in a 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.989
 store 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.520
 people came from far away to appreciate 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.520

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.880
