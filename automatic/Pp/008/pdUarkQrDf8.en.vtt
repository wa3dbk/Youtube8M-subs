00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and that's cool, the video of today is 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.830
 to show you how to do it 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.389
 exchange the voucher for the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.389
 Disney releases the sticker 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.630
 We're making this video because 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.640
 many people have doubts about this and it is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.980
 a video more intended for backyards 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.890
 for those who are staying in a hotel outside 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.200
 because they are people who leave the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.270
 Brazil with back and disney in hands 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.530
 they are seeing in the pictures a voucher of the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 disney appearing 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.670
 it has a confirmation number to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.190
 amount of tickets purchased 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.930
 and the type of ticket that was purchased 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.269
 So the person will leave Brazil with 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.250
 This walsh is there when it gets here. 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.750
 In disney parks she has to change 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.170
 and if you come back because you can not 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 get the paper in the park ratchet 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.790
 you have to come with a ticket 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.800
 then the person is going to do it 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.199
 will get here with this walsh and she will 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.759
 if you direct her to a box office 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.430
 will certainly do this the first time 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.440
 Dad that she went to visit here now. 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.800
 The box office is closed at six o'clock 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.350
 in the afternoon but goes from there to 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.960
 at the other end, this is where we 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.300
 You're filming, they're already closed. 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.160
 the other end there so open and has 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.189
 A lot of people there exchanging that hour 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.619
 then you will deliver the walsh and it will 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.810
 receive the magnetic scratch card here 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.479
 this little card will be a card for 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.250
 each person and here they will appear 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.500
 every day park ticket 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.720
 that you usually bought in the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.549
 disney they write the name of the person 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 behind each card that is written 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.470
 because it's another team that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 people have and that makes it easier because 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.460
 When are you going to get this ticket? 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.829
 to enter the park you will have to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.960
 register your fingerprint and the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.229
 imagine i registered my impression 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.150
 digital in this ticket and there to other 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.380
 people in my family 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.420
 also 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.610
 Only tomorrow we'll go to the park. 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 and then I'll get the ticket as it is 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.540
 I'll know what's in it for me. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.970
 digital fingerprint and has as a 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.280
 know only having the name behind 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.250
 so this is it is the first step 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.280
 exchange the voucher through the physical ticket on 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 park tickets or at best wishes 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.739
 disney downtown or paste and which is 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 a specific box office for those who are 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.090
 there just making this exchange 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.250
 and then after you do that you will 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.870
 enter the park there you will do the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.269
 Following 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.519
 use the same card everyone is 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.080
 passing he has to sell himself by helping 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.730
 you will not have any difficulty going 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 pass and will print 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.450
 digital is much doubt that people have 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.430
 What about the net that band? 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.019
 rebecca how am I going to make comedy 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.940
 And where are you going from here? 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.400
 Calm down, people do not despair, Mexico. 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.560
 well here and it is all over the place in 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 any store you are going to enter 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.099
 having a doctor has been defending 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 including the box office 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.620
 they leave here in front of the show 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.989
 so a big straw full of doctor 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.730
 and band and at the box office you can buy 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 only those sold in the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.799
 box office are these simple type this 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.780
 This is where I come from. 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:21.690
 smooth if you want one that is more is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.540
 the theme of my dome that has 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.400
 for something else is special if you 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.349
 Do you want anything more special there? 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.659
 Let's go shopping inside the park. 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.609
 because you will have much more choice to 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.980
 Genetic depends on this balance that 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.560
 we have the almost three dollars a 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.239
 rate after you have to buy your 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.480
 well what will happen with 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.910
 this card here nothing he will stay for 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.859
 I remind you because from the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.079
 moment you have your medical band 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.599
 You will not need to use the card any more. 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.239
 because here inside the card has a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.400
 system and this system that has within 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.650
 card is the same as having doctor and band 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
 So when are you going to buy your doctor? 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.290
 and band is just you ask for the box 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.819
 store your ticket to your doctor 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.230
 and band the income how will I talk 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.030
 I do not know how to speak english 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.030
 We mimic each other very easily. 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.720
 Hahaha solved the problem the person has 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.940
 You will not pay anything to do this. 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.919
 all the information that is here in the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.389
 card system will move to the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.460
 brace system 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.990
 and then you can save the card to 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.490
 Will not you use it for? 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.280
 but nothing because from that moment 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.500
 You'll wear your bracelet to enter. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.110
 parks to enter the attractions that 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.150
 has pre-scheduled does not actually 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.130
 What are you going to do? 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.990
 information promises to sell my card 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.240
 it's no use, it's not it, it's going 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.550
 remain useful it will continue with the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.740
 information here but the bracelet 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.479
 It will give you more convenience because 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.800
 as it will be on your wrist time 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.780
 whole you will not need to stay 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.729
 I get my ticket every time I go 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.770
 get in there on the attraction that is with a 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.840
 aspect scheduled by the gym in my 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.550
 card will attend such 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.530
 arrives there in front of the cart must 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.060
 pass the card again there goes in the other 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.789
 attraction has to pass the card again 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.099
 and it's all the time a shot and put 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.590
 that you can 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.289
 end up losing your ticket then 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.789
 medical and band it is an amenity 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.250
 In the old days we 'll have to talk 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.909
 It's a luxury It's a luxury It's not a luxury It 's a 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.919
 convenience and this tip people this video 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.440
 what we are doing is who we are 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.820
 hosts out of disney hotels because 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.220
 who stay at disney hotels 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.570
 when you arrive there to do the check in 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.820
 bracelet will already be there cute 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.500
 person and everything will already be consisting in 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.690
 then she will not have this 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.659
 worry of having to the box office 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.340
 have to change and in the shop buy doctor 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.479
 and it'll be all over when she 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.150
 Arriving at the hotel, everything will be there. 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.669
 ready for her who is not a guest of the 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.639
 Disney has to make these spaces 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.860
 both to change the ticket and to 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.419
 buy the bracelet if you want because 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.979
 I do not want you can keep using 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.020
 join there 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.849
 throughout your trip that you will not have 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.469
 No problem, there are people who do not want 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.550
 buy the bracelet but there are people already 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.199
 leave Brazil 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.180
 The first thing I want to do is 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.400
 rebecca is buying for being what I have 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.889
 what to do then this video we did 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.229
 for you to understand how it's all this 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.789
 exchange process and do not forget there 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.330
 dedicates us to the fact that we 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.639
 downtown disney records 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.770
 is much more empty than the box office 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.289
 So before you go up and down 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.080
 bob before shopping 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.000
 will solve this problem and the ticket 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.409
 this little issue and the ticket that is 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.789
 When do you get here in the park? 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.310
 You have already entered directly. 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.310
 This is the most practical and 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.379
 reminding you both of you coming back from 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.990
