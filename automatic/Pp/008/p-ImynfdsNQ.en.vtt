00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.399 
gonna give him more support he's gonna
have<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.060> huge<00:01:55.270> backpack<00:01:55.750> on<00:01:55.930> his<00:01:56.020> shoulders<00:01:56.290> in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
have a huge backpack on his shoulders in

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.890 
have a huge backpack on his shoulders in
a<00:01:56.500> second<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:56.950> will<00:01:57.100> help<00:01:57.250> him<00:01:57.340> stand<00:01:57.610> up

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
a second and this will help him stand up

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.679 
a second and this will help him stand up
is<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.170> real<00:01:59.320> reason<00:01:59.350> why<00:01:59.740> we<00:01:59.890> have<00:02:00.040> this

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
is that the real reason why we have this

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.179 
is that the real reason why we have this
maybe<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.990> don't<00:02:02.110> know<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.619> didn't<00:02:02.920> design<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
maybe I don't know I didn't design it

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.980 
maybe I don't know I didn't design it
but<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.490> figure<00:02:03.850> that's<00:02:04.030> what<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.420> it's

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
but I figure that's what it's for it's

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.170 
but I figure that's what it's for it's
just<00:02:05.229> my<00:02:05.409> totally<00:02:05.920> biased<00:02:06.250> opinion<00:02:06.670> there<00:02:07.030> we

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
just my totally biased opinion there we

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.749 
just my totally biased opinion there we
go<00:02:07.619> plus<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.799> mean<00:02:08.920> he's<00:02:09.069> got<00:02:09.220> guns<00:02:09.429> at<00:02:09.640> knee

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
go plus I mean he's got guns at knee

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.089 
go plus I mean he's got guns at knee
level<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.319> even<00:02:11.319> though<00:02:11.409> he's<00:02:11.530> taller<00:02:11.830> that's

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
level now even though he's taller that's

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.240 
level now even though he's taller that's
probably<00:02:12.459> hip<00:02:13.030> level<00:02:13.299> now<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.680> mean<00:02:14.980> he<00:02:15.129> can

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
probably hip level now so I mean he can

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.220 
probably hip level now so I mean he can
fire<00:02:15.579> off<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:15.969> the<00:02:16.060> hip<00:02:16.239> without<00:02:16.659> having<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.049> do

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.500 
can take his handgun and we can mount
this<00:03:56.739> back<00:03:57.550> on<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:59.560> cannon<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:01.330> is<00:04:01.450> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
this back on to that cannon this is the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.760 
this back on to that cannon this is the
way<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.690> shows<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.020> on<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.200> Box<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.560> can

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
way it shows it on the Box you can

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.410 
way it shows it on the Box you can
actually<00:04:03.130> make<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.610> wings<00:04:03.820> face<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
actually make it so the wings face the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.400 
actually make it so the wings face the
other<00:04:04.540> way<00:04:06.690> see<00:04:07.690> if<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:07.840> can<00:04:07.959> do<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.200> here

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
other way see if we can do that here

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:18.640 
other way see if we can do that here
without<00:04:08.530> pulling<00:04:09.340> them<00:04:09.430> apart<00:04:11.040> nope<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.220> can't

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:34.340 

there<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.740> go<00:04:28.910> then<00:04:29.910> what<00:04:30.000> we<00:04:30.120> can<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:33.260> flip<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
there we go then what we can do flip the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.190 
there we go then what we can do flip the
guns<00:04:34.500> over<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.800> top<00:04:38.390> doesn't<00:04:39.390> matter<00:04:39.540> I<00:04:39.810> don't

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
guns over the top doesn't matter I don't

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.610 
guns over the top doesn't matter I don't
know<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.380> think<00:04:40.530> even<00:04:40.980> in<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.190> show<00:04:41.400> Oh<00:04:42.530> even<00:04:43.530> in

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
know I think even in the show Oh even in

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.460 
know I think even in the show Oh even in
the<00:04:43.710> show<00:04:43.890> he<00:04:44.280> would<00:04:44.370> have<00:04:44.520> them<00:04:44.670> underneath

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
the show he would have them underneath

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.600 
the show he would have them underneath
we<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.590> flip<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.920> these<00:04:47.040> little<00:04:47.190> side<00:04:47.370> pieces

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
we can flip out these little side pieces

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.370 
we can flip out these little side pieces
on<00:04:47.820> his<00:04:47.940> head<00:04:48.090> now<00:04:48.270> he's<00:04:48.990> got<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.230> little
