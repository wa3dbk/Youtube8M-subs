00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.450
 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen how are you already 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.820
 heard i want an example of this from behind 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.010
 standing building show you how 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.230
 works greece smoke and ash system 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.009
 deletion 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.409
 so far the storm is about to be located 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.519
 outside it will be insecure yes and mine 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.359
 I can spoil a suit too 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 will get her inside 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.039
 here at least stay dry 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.859
 the causes of fires may be the most 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.860
 various overload sockets 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.800
 or faulty appliances it 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.660
 just a couple of examples to the word but especially 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.770
 dangerous 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.060
 for search for fire as they are for a long time 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.440
 go unnoticed and 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.040
 produces carbon monoxide tour operator haiti 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 mortal danger to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.820
 avoid it in public buildings 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 as an example in this course this complex 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 established fire regulations 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.490
 security 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.480
 they prescribe emergency exits 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.100
 were not smoky 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.730
 condition it is important for people 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.020
 yourself could quickly leave the danger zone 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.240
 the system takes on this task from smoke and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.860
 ash removal shortly called 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.300
 first oao this system is understandable 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.390
 from the name effectively derives 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.800
 green 5 heat edition 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.450
 at the same time the door and windows at the bottom of the building 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690
 creates air flow and only on 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.780
 the upper part serves as a protracted 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.590
 holes 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 ordinary smoke systems because this is removal 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.690
 consist of air ventilation device 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.579
 emergency source control panels 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.130
 current alarm and to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.930
 example smoke detectors 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.120
 debugging the system think this removal 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.680
 often complicated by being in the right place 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.840
 install named components 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 released by various manufacturers 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.730
 The advantage of the company and Greece is 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.530
 how do you take weather into account? 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440
 while the client of greece you communicate 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.750
 competent partner spared 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.850
 from installation problems 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.110
 consider separately the component parts 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.290
 smoke and ash removal systems 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.640
 more closely 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.160
 no on movable backs you see 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.130
 lever system mechanism first bye 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 the doors are equipped with such 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.920
 opening system guarantee a large 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.979
 accurate airflow 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.369
 on this window you see the pivotal system 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.240
 opening 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.100
 first in the pillar or during the whole 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.690
 sixty seconds this system opens up 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.149
 full width window 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.519
 all you need is central 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.600
 control panel 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.460
 emergency source control panel 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.459
 current nb crs 300 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.769
 takes over supply 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.489
 coordination monitoring all 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.650
 connected system opening and emergency 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.719
 of control 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.609
 ten 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.159
 just recently I mentioned before 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.709
 sad fame now we 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.879
 we can see how the smoke system works 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.169
 and ash removal gradually here too 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.149
 almost nothing is already uncomfortable 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.159
 I see no luck, good luck, smoke 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.379
 activated the alarm but i can 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.760
 use and emergency 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.659
 switches it also includes 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.609
 alarm as soon as the remote 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.540
 emergency source control 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.409
 intuition current 300 will fix the alarm 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.889
 Tolkins top of the building will 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.090
 automatically open dima warm 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.589
 can be displayed on the weapon 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.419
 you see that the top of the room 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.689
 but the lower part is felt 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.109
 rooms to free from smoke is necessary 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.589
 air flow is now a remote control 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.069
 inflation 300 opens doors and at the bottom 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.269
 building 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.569
 upward heat flow and incoming 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.200
 air creates the effect of the fireplace therefore 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.819
 flue gases generated 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.980
 rises up and through the window almost 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.999
 completely deleted edition essentially 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.180
 to show this on our movement 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.949
 demonstration opening the regiment on 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.669
 top floor and doors on the first 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.189
 floor takes place in two stages in 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.430
 reality not to lose the crawl time 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.729
 and the doors open simultaneously 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.339
 now and the bottom of the room 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.290
 significantly smoke free 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.719
 people in the building can without 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.279
 health risk leave the danger zone 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.699
 I think it's time for me to leave the territory 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.609
 and give way to fire work 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.879
 Artyukh teams 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.159
 crayfish
