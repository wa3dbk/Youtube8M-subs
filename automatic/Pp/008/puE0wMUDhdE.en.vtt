cool the legs they trifecta fold out so

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.650 
cool the legs they trifecta fold out so
you<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.730> flatten<00:04:05.120> them<00:04:05.299> when<00:04:05.420> you're<00:04:05.510> on<00:04:05.630> the

which I just happen to have because I am
such<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> super<00:04:14.510> collector<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.930> transformers<00:04:15.739> I

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
such a super collector of transformers I

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.449 
such a super collector of transformers I
have<00:04:16.010> over<00:04:16.789> 15<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.329> them<00:04:17.479> hands<00:04:18.380> go<00:04:18.709> down<00:04:18.739> um

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
have over 15 of them hands go down um

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.080 
have over 15 of them hands go down um
legs<00:04:20.390> are<00:04:20.690> jointed<00:04:21.019> right<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:23.060> right

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
legs are jointed right here and right

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.250 
legs are jointed right here and right
here<00:04:24.310> very<00:04:25.310> cool<00:04:26.710> figure<00:04:28.570> met<00:04:29.570> through

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
here very cool figure met through

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.120 
here very cool figure met through
minutes<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.750> better<00:04:32.750> get<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.410> transforming

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
minutes so I better get to transforming

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.410 
minutes so I better get to transforming
him<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.550> that's<00:04:34.880> probably<00:04:35.060> gonna<00:04:35.270> be<00:04:35.330> a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
him so that's probably gonna be a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.120 
him so that's probably gonna be a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
cool the thighs move but like

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.670 
cool the thighs move but like
transformers<00:04:57.410> they're<00:04:57.680> based<00:04:58.640> upon<00:04:59.680> being

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
transformers they're based upon being

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.810 
transformers they're based upon being
able<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.160> switch<00:05:01.520> in<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.060> out<00:05:02.650> so<00:05:03.650> each<00:05:04.130> like

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
able to switch in and out so each like

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.610 
able to switch in and out so each like
the<00:05:05.090> vehicle<00:05:05.480> mode<00:05:05.690> can't<00:05:06.050> have<00:05:06.260> everything

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
the vehicle mode can't have everything

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.440 
the vehicle mode can't have everything
that<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.070> would<00:05:07.280> want<00:05:07.550> in<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.180> figure

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
that you would want in it and the figure

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.670 
that you would want in it and the figure
mode<00:05:08.630> can<00:05:08.840> have<00:05:09.050> everything<00:05:09.290> you<00:05:09.560> would<00:05:09.620> want

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
mode can have everything you would want

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.060 
mode can have everything you would want
it<00:05:10.010> because<00:05:10.130> they<00:05:10.460> have<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:11.020> set<00:05:12.020> apart<00:05:12.860> the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
it because they have to set apart the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.630 
it because they have to set apart the
two<00:05:13.420> um<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:16.310> know<00:05:16.460> basis<00:05:17.300> of<00:05:17.600> operations<00:05:18.200> so

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
two um you know basis of operations so

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.330 
two um you know basis of operations so
yeah<00:05:19.640> so<00:05:20.090> uh<00:05:20.120> definitely<00:05:20.900> really<00:05:21.740> cool<00:05:21.770> at

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
yeah so uh definitely really cool at

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.870 
yeah so uh definitely really cool at
this<00:05:22.610> point<00:05:22.850> probably<00:05:23.150> display<00:05:23.630> him<00:05:24.880> standing

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
this point probably display him standing

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.030

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.100 

transformer<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:40.010> Fallen<00:06:40.660> so<00:06:41.660> I'm<00:06:41.810> not<00:06:41.960> sure

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
transformer the Fallen so I'm not sure

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.930 
transformer the Fallen so I'm not sure
if<00:06:42.170> the<00:06:42.290> movies<00:06:42.560> based<00:06:42.860> around<00:06:43.190> him

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
if the movies based around him

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.350 
if the movies based around him
or<00:06:44.030> if<00:06:45.250> he<00:06:46.250> is<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:49.030> just<00:06:50.030> one<00:06:50.210> of<00:06:50.300> the

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
or if he is the just one of the

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.270 
or if he is the just one of the
Decepticons<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:51.230> comes<00:06:51.440> in<00:06:51.650> but<00:06:51.860> he<00:06:52.130> has

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
Decepticons that comes in but he has

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.160 
Decepticons that comes in but he has
like<00:06:52.610> unlimited<00:06:52.910> power<00:06:53.360> so<00:06:53.630> i'm<00:06:53.690> pretty<00:06:53.960> sure

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
like unlimited power so i'm pretty sure

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.530 
like unlimited power so i'm pretty sure
he<00:06:54.290> plays<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:55.180> major<00:06:56.180> role<00:06:56.480> in<00:06:57.100> the<00:06:58.100> movie<00:06:58.540> so

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
he plays a major role in the movie so

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.660 
he plays a major role in the movie so
that's<00:06:59.960> him<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.590> Fallen<00:07:01.040> I'm<00:07:01.250> trying<00:07:01.580> to

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670
