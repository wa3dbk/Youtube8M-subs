why in a minute because it's going to
keep<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.799> from<00:03:13.980> having<00:03:14.370> usually<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.180> would

this piece and tape actually this piece
it<00:03:27.930> doesn't<00:03:28.200> matter<00:03:28.410> if<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.799> double<00:03:29.190> sided

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
it doesn't matter if it's double sided

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.340 
it doesn't matter if it's double sided
tape<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.820> not<00:03:29.970> actually<00:03:30.660> it'd<00:03:30.810> probably<00:03:31.079> be

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
tape or not actually it'd probably be

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.680 
tape or not actually it'd probably be
better<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> wasn't<00:03:32.880> double-sided<00:03:33.359> tape

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
better that it wasn't double-sided tape

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.140 
better that it wasn't double-sided tape
so<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.650> grab<00:03:35.579> me<00:03:35.790> some<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.180> yeah<00:03:38.150> now

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
so if you grab me some of that yeah now

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.580 
so if you grab me some of that yeah now
that<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.390> think<00:03:39.450> about<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.900> because<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.560> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
that I think about it because if it is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.319 
that I think about it because if it is
double-sided<00:03:41.130> when<00:03:41.670> you're<00:03:41.790> pulling<00:03:42.000> your

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
double-sided when you're pulling your

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.509 
double-sided when you're pulling your
other<00:03:42.510> piece<00:03:42.780> over<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:43.709> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.950> stick<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
other piece over it's going to stick to

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.849 
other piece over it's going to stick to
it<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.910> might<00:03:45.090> mess<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.380> want

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
it and it might mess you up so you want

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.789 
it and it might mess you up so you want
to<00:03:46.950> use<00:03:47.100> regular<00:03:47.640> tape<00:03:47.910> for<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:48.650> mm-hmm<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
to use regular tape for this mm-hmm a

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.160 
to use regular tape for this mm-hmm a
couple<00:03:50.640> pieces<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:51.180> pieces<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.720> usually<00:03:52.049> don't

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
couple pieces one pieces I usually don't

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.560 
couple pieces one pieces I usually don't
use<00:03:52.440> too<00:03:52.709> much<00:03:52.920> but<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.400> then<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.880> like<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.209> push

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
use too much but and then I like to push

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.349 
use too much but and then I like to push
it<00:03:54.870> up<00:03:55.079> against<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.560> edge<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:56.030> tightly<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.209> i

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
it up against the edge as tightly as i

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.809 
it up against the edge as tightly as i
can<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.410> then<00:03:58.470> pull<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.850> over<00:04:01.489> gotta<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.670> an

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
can and then pull this over gotta get an

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.150 
can and then pull this over gotta get an
angle<00:04:03.269> here<00:04:03.480> where<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.690> can<00:04:03.840> see<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.410> then

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
angle here where you can see and then

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.240 
angle here where you can see and then
bring<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.120> as<00:04:06.239> again<00:04:06.750> tightly<00:04:07.500> as<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.680> can<00:04:08.010> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
bring it as again tightly as you can and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
bring it as again tightly as you can and
then<00:04:08.819> you<00:04:08.970> are<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.510> take<00:04:09.810> and

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
then you are going to take and

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.590 
then you are going to take and
especially<00:04:10.920> with<00:04:11.190> these<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.670> clothing

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
especially with these like clothing

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.599 
especially with these like clothing
boxes<00:04:13.290> work<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.680> best<00:04:13.889> because<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.370> can<00:04:14.489> get

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
boxes work the best because you can get

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.360 
boxes work the best because you can get
a<00:04:14.639> really<00:04:14.940> crisp<00:04:15.299> line<00:04:15.889> you're<00:04:16.889> going<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.130> kind

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
a really crisp line you're going to kind

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.830 
a really crisp line you're going to kind
of<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.669> Natalie<00:04:18.000> did<00:04:18.150> earlier<00:04:18.510> but<00:04:18.690> you're

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
of do it Natalie did earlier but you're

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.420 
of do it Natalie did earlier but you're
gonna<00:04:18.930> that's<00:04:19.229> going<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.530> form<00:04:19.799> your<00:04:19.889> line<00:04:20.070> for

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
gonna that's going to form your line for

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.279 
gonna that's going to form your line for
you<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.049> then<00:04:22.049> bring<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.860> back<00:04:22.890> down<00:04:23.340> do<00:04:24.289> want

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
you and then bring it back down do want

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.650 
you and then bring it back down do want
crease<00:04:26.130> all<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.610> way<00:04:26.729> across

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
crease all the way across

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.140 
crease all the way across
and<00:04:27.780> then<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.860> way<00:04:29.100> when<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.520> bring<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.880> back

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and then that way when you bring it back

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.660 
and then that way when you bring it back
here<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:31.290> is<00:04:31.410> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> go<00:04:31.800> right<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.640> your

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
here it is going to go right to your

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.610 
here it is going to go right to your
edge<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.720> then<00:04:33.900> we're<00:04:34.140> just<00:04:34.170> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.440> put<00:04:34.590> our

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
edge so then we're just going to put our

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.470 
edge so then we're just going to put our
double<00:04:35.040> sided<00:04:35.220> tape<00:04:35.370> right<00:04:35.760> here<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.330> then

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
double sided tape right here and then

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.120 
double sided tape right here and then
you<00:04:36.600> will<00:04:36.750> never<00:04:36.930> see<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.170> tape<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.740> your<00:04:37.770> line

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
you will never see the tape in your line

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.500 
you will never see the tape in your line
will<00:04:38.400> come<00:04:38.550> all<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.880> way<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.240> edge<00:04:39.360> of

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
will come all the way to the edge of

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.450 
will come all the way to the edge of
your<00:04:39.630> box<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:42.060> added<00:04:42.450> some<00:04:42.630> tape<00:04:42.930> here<00:04:43.250> this<00:04:44.250> is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
your box so added some tape here this is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.650 
your box so added some tape here this is
the<00:04:44.760> score<00:04:45.450> Powell<00:04:45.810> tape<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:48.450> want<00:04:48.600> to

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
kind of have it as close to the edge as

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.620 
kind of have it as close to the edge as
you<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.820> what's<00:04:51.030> awesome<00:04:51.240> about<00:04:51.450> this

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
you can and what's awesome about this

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.140 
you can and what's awesome about this
double-sided<00:04:52.200> tape<00:04:52.560> as<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:52.980> clear<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.580> you

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
double-sided tape as it is clear so you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.370 
double-sided tape as it is clear so you
don't<00:04:54.330> have<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.570> worry<00:04:54.750> about<00:04:54.840> if<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.140> little

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
don't have to worry about if a little

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.750 
don't have to worry about if a little
bit<00:04:55.500> does<00:04:55.710> get<00:04:55.950> over<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.720> edge<00:04:57.900> there<00:04:57.930> okay

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
bit does get over the edge there okay

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.040 
bit does get over the edge there okay
now<00:04:59.760> we're<00:05:00.000> gonna<00:05:00.240> okay<00:05:02.300> bring<00:05:03.300> it<00:05:03.330> up<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:04.020> the

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
now we're gonna okay bring it up to the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.280 
now we're gonna okay bring it up to the
edge<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.820> now<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.150> have<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:09.870> perfect

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
edge and now you have this perfect

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.320 
edge and now you have this perfect
crease<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:10.950> can't<00:05:11.400> even<00:05:11.580> tell<00:05:11.940> where<00:05:12.210> it

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
crease you can't even tell where it

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.190 
crease you can't even tell where it
starts<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.100> then<00:05:14.100> we're<00:05:14.340> going<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.670> do<00:05:15.200> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
starts and then we're going to do the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.950 
starts and then we're going to do the
traditional<00:05:16.440> way<00:05:16.980> hopefully<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:17.940> can<00:05:18.090> see<00:05:18.810> it

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
traditional way hopefully you can see it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.990 
traditional way hopefully you can see it
here<00:05:19.260> just<00:05:20.040> like<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.280> normally<00:05:20.580> how<00:05:20.940> you

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
here just like you normally how you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.230 
here just like you normally how you
normally<00:05:21.270> start<00:05:21.780> out<00:05:22.050> on<00:05:22.740> your<00:05:23.280> edges<00:05:23.760> on<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240
