are shiny does this have to set a little
bit<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.549> want<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.000> colors<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> blend

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
bit if you want the colors to blend

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
bit if you want the colors to blend
together<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.220> decorate<00:01:47.700> right

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
together then you would decorate right

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
together then you would decorate right
now<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:49.020> example<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.409> could<00:01:49.649> draw<00:01:49.860> lines

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
now for example you could draw lines

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
now for example you could draw lines
across<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:50.970> pull<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.509> toothpick

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
across it and then pull a toothpick

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
across it and then pull a toothpick
across<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.649> make<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.950> tie-dye<00:01:53.250> pattern

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
across and it can make a tie-dye pattern

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.550 
across and it can make a tie-dye pattern
but<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.450> want<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> frosting<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.320> sit<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
but if you want the frosting to sit on

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530 
but if you want the frosting to sit on
top<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.189> yes<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.759> would<00:01:56.850> wait<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.329> to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
top then yes we would wait for this to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.959 
top then yes we would wait for this to
to<00:01:58.469> cool<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> separate

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to cool and you kind of have to separate

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:00.760 
to cool and you kind of have to separate
distinct

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
distinct

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.130 
distinct
oops<00:02:01.009> now<00:02:01.609> what<00:02:01.850> cookies<00:02:02.479> shape<00:02:02.750> would<00:02:02.990> you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
oops now what cookies shape would you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.330 
oops now what cookies shape would you
use<00:02:03.350> for<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.649> wedding<00:02:03.740> favor

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
use for a wedding favor

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.969 
use for a wedding favor
we<00:02:04.520> have<00:02:04.609> wedding<00:02:04.909> cake<00:02:05.299> shaped<00:02:05.960> cookies<00:02:06.619> yeah

we have wedding cake shaped cookies yeah

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.529 
we have wedding cake shaped cookies yeah
it's<00:02:07.130> three<00:02:07.310> separate<00:02:07.640> distinct<00:02:08.030> layers<00:02:08.239> and

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
it's three separate distinct layers and

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.479 
it's three separate distinct layers and
you<00:02:08.599> can<00:02:08.629> frost<00:02:09.440> them<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:09.890> different

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
you can frost them with different

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.610 
you can frost them with different
colored<00:02:10.910> frostings<00:02:11.450> or<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.110> frosting

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
colored frostings or all in frosting

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.220 
colored frostings or all in frosting
color<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.670> use<00:02:13.819> sprinkles<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.480> them<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.050> some

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
color and use sprinkles on them so some

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.660 
color and use sprinkles on them so some
of<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.379> frosting<00:02:15.560> might<00:02:15.920> drip<00:02:16.160> down<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.340> side

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of the frosting might drip down the side

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.280 
of the frosting might drip down the side
but<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:16.970> think<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.360> adds<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.900> personal

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
but I think that adds to the personal

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.900 
but I think that adds to the personal
look<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.709> cookie<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.489> doesn't<00:02:19.790> bother

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
look of the cookie that doesn't bother

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820 
look of the cookie that doesn't bother
me<00:02:20.060> at<00:02:20.209> all<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.349> could<00:02:21.470> tell<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.739> these

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
me at all and you could tell that these

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.979 
me at all and you could tell that these
cookies<00:02:22.190> are<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.730> massed<00:02:23.269> decorated<00:02:23.870> they're

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
cookies are not massed decorated they're

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.940

decorated<00:02:24.379> by<00:02:24.470> hand

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
decorated by hand

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.339 
decorated by hand
well<00:02:25.940> even<00:02:26.390> though<00:02:26.480> you're<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> cookie<00:02:27.019> company

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.750 
well even though you're a cookie company
you<00:02:27.620> can<00:02:27.769> still<00:02:27.980> say<00:02:28.190> these<00:02:28.370> are<00:02:28.519> homemade

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
certainly qualifies I think and in small

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.539 
certainly qualifies I think and in small
batches<00:02:32.450> small<00:02:33.349> batches<00:02:33.590> right<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.430> my
