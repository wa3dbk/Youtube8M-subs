this is a typical annual mix this little
mix<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.540> use<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.710> farm<00:00:26.009> which<00:00:26.399> has<00:00:26.640> some

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
mix we use here the farm which has some

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
mix we use here the farm which has some
chunkier<00:00:27.720> pieces<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.290> perlite<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:28.890> are

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
chunkier pieces of perlite which are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.260 
chunkier pieces of perlite which are
these<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.250> white<00:00:29.579> things<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
these little white things it's got a

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.029 
these little white things it's got a
little<00:00:30.450> bit<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> bark<00:00:30.989> and<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:32.189> got<00:00:32.340> Pete<00:00:34.039> so

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
little bit of bark and it's got Pete so

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.119 
little bit of bark and it's got Pete so
we<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.429> the<00:00:35.550> bark<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> increase<00:00:37.129> some

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we have the bark is to increase some

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.160 
we have the bark is to increase some
aeration<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> soil<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.809> holds<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
aeration in the soil and it holds on to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.430 
aeration in the soil and it holds on to
a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.589> bit<00:00:43.679> more<00:00:43.890> water<00:00:44.929> and<00:00:45.929> then<00:00:46.109> we<00:00:46.260> have

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a little bit more water and then we have

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
a little bit more water and then we have
this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.769> perennial<00:00:47.039> mix<00:00:47.519> where<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.879> can

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
this is a perennial mix where you can

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.419 
this is a perennial mix where you can
see<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> gets<00:00:48.629> even<00:00:48.929> chunkier<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:50.249> has

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
see that it gets even chunkier which has

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.799 
see that it gets even chunkier which has
big<00:00:50.670> pieces<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.149> bark<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.839> it<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:53.780> same<00:00:54.780> thing

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
big pieces of bark in it and same thing

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.860 
big pieces of bark in it and same thing
better<00:00:55.499> aeration<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.309> pulls<00:00:57.210> onto<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
better aeration and pulls onto water a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
better aeration and pulls onto water a
little<00:00:58.109> longer<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:59.460> then<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.659> a<00:01:01.100> sandy

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
little longer and then this is a sandy

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.630 
little longer and then this is a sandy
mix<00:01:02.600> which<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.050> took<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.980> annual<00:01:05.309> mix

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
mix which I took some of the annual mix

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
mix which I took some of the annual mix
and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.320> put<00:01:07.320> some<00:01:07.439> sand<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.079> part

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and I put some sand in it so be one part

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
and I put some sand in it so be one part
of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> regular<00:01:11.009> mix<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:12.000> parts<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
of the regular mix and two parts of the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.710 
of the regular mix and two parts of the
sand<00:01:13.280> so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sand so

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.500 
sand so
but<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.800> our<00:01:16.920> today's<00:01:17.280> purpose<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.360> going

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
but for our today's purpose we're going

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.490 
but for our today's purpose we're going
to<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> regular<00:01:20.780> potting<00:01:21.780> mix

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.220 

so<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.800> don't<00:01:25.950> make<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.070> mess<00:01:26.370> just<00:01:27.060> fill<00:01:28.050> our

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
so we don't make a mess just fill our

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.370 
so we don't make a mess just fill our
but<00:01:29.240> something<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.750> late<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.230> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
but something go a little late and I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130 
but something go a little late and I
went<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.920> top<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.690> when<00:01:33.690> I<00:01:33.720> water<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
went to the top because when I water it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.900 
went to the top because when I water it
it's<00:01:34.440> gonna<00:01:34.620> sink<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.220> I'm<00:01:35.340> not<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.670> press

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
it's gonna sink and I'm not gonna press

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.690 
it's gonna sink and I'm not gonna press
down<00:01:35.940> on<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:37.160> we<00:01:38.160> don't<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.550> take

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
down on it because we don't want to take

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
down on it because we don't want to take
the<00:01:38.820> air<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> plants<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.660> air<00:01:39.840> especially

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the air the plants need air especially

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
the air the plants need air especially
the<00:01:40.470> roots<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.160> we<00:01:41.190> don't<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.640> make<00:01:41.730> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the roots so we don't want to make that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.570 
the roots so we don't want to make that
mistake<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.330> pressing<00:01:42.690> down<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.980> fill<00:01:44.430> up

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
mistake of pressing down so just fill up

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.660 
mistake of pressing down so just fill up
all<00:01:45.480> our<00:01:45.810> pots

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.460 

it's<00:01:52.970> good

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.040 

okay
