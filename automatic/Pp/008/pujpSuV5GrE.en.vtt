00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.830
 marine like that and I'm a saleswoman in 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 organic store and organic stores I 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.320
 do not know if you noticed but everything 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.779
 what's inside it has a weird name 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:30.289
 of tofu stretches from lupine tempo on 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 looks like Harry Potter characters 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 alias is a pure one must imagine the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.469
 home and cold version 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 in short, it is a drowned trap not 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.930
 the 3d but if we have to eat organic it must 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.250
 to be at grid 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.480
 it has all the characteristics it is 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.879
 true he has a big beard 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 he has long hair a little fat 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.430
 oil to a sheepskin jacket 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 frankly it misses two things that's 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.770
 smell the essential oils and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.930
 to have open sandals any 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 the year me in the world at the stores 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.110
 that people like that I cross everything 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.129
 the time it is true I recognize 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.450
 easily it is those who choose 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.090
 their bottles of water and their apples 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 with a pendulum is what mouths 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.960
 when you tell them they can not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.130
 show in the store with the dragons 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 it's true of the fact in fact today 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.619
 the worst it is really people 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.240
 democratic and that's fine the whole 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.619
 world eats organic because we know it the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.509
 bio is good for us it's good for 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 them for the environment it's good for 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.409
 for people for our body 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.580
 I think we should pay more 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.840
 with his credit card in the shops 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.990
 bio should directly put the card 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990
 vital 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.130
 I say that but the devil is 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.509
 not only convinced 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.619
 in organic stores no there is also 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.159
 ladies they enter the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.540
 organic shops 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.799
 they have big coats in 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.890
 fur and bags is Tuesday in 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.600
 a bio store me with my colleagues on 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.950
 call them the bio kaunas thank you and the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.240
 it's true that we have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.340
 did the technique have to wait a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.380
 moment I will ask my colleague 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.720
 tim does not hear I made a call nor 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 against timothy you could bring me back 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.990
 one that you said please in 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.670
 crate I think you do not know where that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.970
 is in the transit section it is the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.230
 material for movement 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.670
 he also takes a box of prunes these 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.920
 transits one for the lady with pretty 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.390
 coats ah yes because often in 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.590
 the organic shops people come in and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.040
 do not know so much dementia that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.799
 come to buy 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.030
 so we can tell them anything 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.790
 so what I advise you for 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410
 your cold is to take a few 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 alpha seeds that you are going to do 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.940
 sprout yourself obviously on a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.650
 Pass sedan ship Maltese lassus for 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.609
 add one or two essential eyes 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.650
 drops of essential oil 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.280
 wintergreen I have a little doubt it is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.510
 maybe from the Kenyan island you can 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.370
 spend ten months but she arrives here 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.690
 in the no there is no wearing the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.799
 elements of the gas project of the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.700
 Last year, people are generally 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.260
 elsewhere it's pretty funny because 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 you can really tell them anything 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.220
 what's the corner then with this product 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.299
 watch out I'm not a naturopath 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.880
 it's really to be taken with 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.900
 tweezers but the best thing to 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.250
 do is ask my colleague 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.450
 in fact I did not taste 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 yes because we sellers of 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.860
 organic stores we have not tasted all the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.340
 store only have 35 thousand produced in 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.200
 a store 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.650
 I devoted myself especially to 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.260
 chocolate ray I laid 23 kilos when 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.790
 I started to lather national 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.130
 So similar shot to order to do 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.750
 small discounts to points not all 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.690
 the sellers of organic stores do not have 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.470
 vote eva joly me personally i 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.640
 voted dumbledore is there and me she me 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.990
 the most magical customers I have 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.890
 it still remains vegans 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.660
 not move if you see what it is 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.110
 that a vegan yes there is in the 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.700
 samba 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.500
 no it's okay because I can do 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 murderers after then the houses 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 of allah it's a bit like 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 vegetarian but extremist saw the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.880
 lunar terrorists of suicide bombers 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.190
 nutritious except that she blows herself up 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.300
 they are blowing the vegetables week 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.080
 that vegans have tremendously 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.480
 vegetables 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.770
 I never lie good vegetables in 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.730
 same time everything is wrong with the 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.870
 Nutella is funny because life 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.040
 it's in the air and subcategories 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.730
 for example there still eats 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.959
 carrots well that's rabbits 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.870
 but if lyon is otherwise they eat that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.780
 sprouted seeds and had actually yielded 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 this protagonist 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.420
 it's a very beautiful I did not invent 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.030
 he's not coming out of harry potter 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.350
 it really exists I'm so scared 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.979
 to forget about it for the show is written 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.880
 this and nothing that does the king write here 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.470
 I feel like I'm part of a 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.729
 sect 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.590
 so we welcome in our church 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.700

 to become the brigitte bardot of the kitchen garden 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.980
 indeed I believe that there is not only 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.130
 animals to be protected 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.840

 against what we should not pronounce 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.700
 the name 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.700
 the ogm
