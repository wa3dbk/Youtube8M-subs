00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
now I haven't ever used this yet I've

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.560 
now I haven't ever used this yet I've
only<00:01:31.320> set<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.040> once<00:01:32.250> replies<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:35.570> haven't

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
only set it up once replies so I haven't

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.920 
only set it up once replies so I haven't
tried<00:01:37.970> actually<00:01:38.970> cooking<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.390> anything<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
tried actually cooking or anything on it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.550 
tried actually cooking or anything on it
but<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:41.720> pretty<00:01:42.720> stable<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.440> know

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
but I can see how pretty stable you know

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870 
but I can see how pretty stable you know
I<00:01:43.770> mean<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.400> lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> weight<00:01:44.850> on

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I mean you can put a lot of weight on

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.020 
I mean you can put a lot of weight on
there<00:01:45.649> also<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.159> want<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> tall<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
there also if you don't want that tall I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.749 
there also if you don't want that tall I
guess<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.509> flip<00:01:48.930> cheese<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
guess you just flip cheese down and a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.789 
guess you just flip cheese down and a
little<00:01:54.119> short<00:01:54.360> table<00:01:55.759> yeah<00:01:57.320> yeah<00:01:58.320> yep

put whatever you want on there but it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
put whatever you want on there but it's
a<00:02:02.580> pretty<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:03.929> cool<00:02:04.289> little<00:02:04.470> table

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
a pretty it's a pretty cool little table

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.590 
a pretty it's a pretty cool little table
you<00:02:05.429> know<00:02:05.550> it's<00:02:05.700> better<00:02:05.880> than<00:02:06.090> cooking<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you know it's better than cooking on the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.290 
you know it's better than cooking on the
dirt<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.220> know<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.459> pack<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.090> sometimes

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
dirt I know I go pack back and sometimes

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.890 
dirt I know I go pack back and sometimes
and<00:02:10.070> you<00:02:11.070> know<00:02:11.160> gets<00:02:12.150> real<00:02:12.330> messy<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:12.810> you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and you know gets real messy when you're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you know gets real messy when you're
sitting<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> dirt<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.910> figured<00:02:14.910> this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
sitting in the dirt so figured this

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.960 
sitting in the dirt so figured this
might<00:02:15.450> help<00:02:16.050> keep<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:17.280> cooking<00:02:17.670> area<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
might help keep just cooking area a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.800 
might help keep just cooking area a
little<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.269> more<00:02:18.390> tidy<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:21.690> after

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
little bit more tidy and a little after

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650 
little bit more tidy and a little after
you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.200> makes<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> little<00:02:23.660> makeshift

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you know makes a little makeshift

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.720 
you know makes a little makeshift
windshield<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.650> something<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.400> really
