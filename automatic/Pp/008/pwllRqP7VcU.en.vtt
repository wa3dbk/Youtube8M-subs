that we have to do is on the other wing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
that we have to do is on the other wing
we<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> servo<00:01:14.909> installed

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
we have to get this servo installed

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
we have to get this servo installed
which<00:01:15.840> we're<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.680> then<00:01:17.400> we're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
going to go ahead and join the wings

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.560 
going to go ahead and join the wings
this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.549> wing<00:01:20.700> joiner<00:01:21.030> there's<00:01:21.330> three

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this is your wing joiner there's three

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
this is your wing joiner there's three
wing<00:01:22.200> joiners<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.340> aluminum<00:01:23.790> piece<00:01:23.970> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
wing joiners here the aluminum piece is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640 
wing joiners here the aluminum piece is
in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> center<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.409> here

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in the center just as you see here

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.499 
in the center just as you see here
that's<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> assemble<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that's how you want to assemble them you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
that's how you want to assemble them you
want<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> stand<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.200> lightly<00:01:28.520> epoxy<00:01:29.520> him<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
want to stand them lightly epoxy him and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 
want to stand them lightly epoxy him and
then<00:01:30.000> epoxy<00:01:30.479> those<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> wings<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.650> we're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
then epoxy those into the wings so we're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
then epoxy those into the wings so we're
gonna<00:01:31.860> show<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> next<00:01:32.930> next<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.079> we're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gonna show you that next next up we're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 
gonna show you that next next up we're
gonna<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> servo<00:01:35.189> installed<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gonna get that servo installed in the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
gonna get that servo installed in the
other<00:01:35.970> wing<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> we're<00:01:36.540> gonna<00:01:36.630> join<00:01:36.930> these

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
other wing and we're gonna join these

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.640 
other wing and we're gonna join these
wings<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.600> sections<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> wing

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
wings the three sections of the wing

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.520 
wings the three sections of the wing
joiner<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.640> been<00:01:41.820> epoxied<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.229> notice

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
joiner have been epoxied you will notice

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
joiner have been epoxied you will notice
that<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.770> wing<00:01:43.979> joiner<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> slight<00:01:45.090> V

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that the wing joiner has a slight V

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
that the wing joiner has a slight V
shape<00:01:45.720> or<00:01:46.020> curve<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> bottom<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
shape or curve you want the bottom of
