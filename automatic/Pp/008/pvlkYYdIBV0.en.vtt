00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.009
 we will prepare the omelette 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.460
 ingredients we need are 3 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.190
 large potatoes an onion 45 eggs 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.310
 extra virgin olive oil and salt 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.960
 We start with the peeled potatoes 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.960
 cut them into thin slices 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.060
 we do the same with the onion 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 and in a large pan we will throw 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 abundant virgin olive oil and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.420
 when it's hot we'll add the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420
 potatoes 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.670
 and the onion 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.890
 we have to catch the potato in the oil 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.990
 so we will lower it to medium heat 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.990
 low and we will measure salt 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.250
 so that also in the oil is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.220
 better cover it with a lid and go 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.860
 checking that the potatoes are not brown 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.309
 and go pounding is a bit with the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.309
 spatula 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.290
 when we check that they are well 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.970
 pochadas we will raise the fire to the maximum 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.970
 to toast them a little 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.720
 and when we have done this we set aside 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.360
 the pan of fire 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.390
 we lay the eggs in a big bowl and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.560
 a pinch of salt in each egg 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 and we beat it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.670
 we drain well the oil potato 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.590
 and we incorporate it into the bowl with the eggs 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.280
 when we have it we move it well 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.320
 and we make an egg shake with potatoes 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.300
 we put a little bit in the oil that we 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.730
 left over in a smaller pan 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.960
 and when it's hot we add our 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.960
 shake eggs with potatoes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.220
 we put the fire medium low 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.570
 and we are controlling that set by the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.560
 center and moving the pan well 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.560
 that does not stick 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.319
 when it takes about five minutes 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.319
 we will take the first round 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.860
 we add another trickle in the pan 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.200
 of oil and we incorporate the tortilla 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.580
 new 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.580
 very carefully 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.959
 we give it a little bit of shape and we have it 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.900
 another 4 or 5 minutes if we like little 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.120
 curd here and we can separate it as 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.940
 we like curd well 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.709
 we take a little more spin and we have it in 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.709
 the fire another three minutes 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.630
 so we know it's fine hopefully 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.510
 Once this is done we take it out of the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.160
 pan and place it on a plate and already 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.300
 We list our tortilla 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.300
 Spanish potatoes
