00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you don't have time to really have a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.410 
you don't have time to really have a
good<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:10.070> ok<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.549> thing's<00:01:11.880> let's<00:01:12.240> say<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
good look at ok that thing's let's say I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.320 
good look at ok that thing's let's say I
can<00:01:12.570> play<00:01:12.750> maybe<00:01:12.990> d5<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> possible

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
can play maybe d5 now it's a possible

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.620 
can play maybe d5 now it's a possible
let's<00:01:15.720> look

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.880 

'if<00:01:23.630> i<00:01:24.850> will<00:01:25.850> take<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.210> c6<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.689> guess<00:01:26.869> yeah<00:01:27.500> I'll

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
'if i will take on c6 I guess yeah I'll

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.700 
'if i will take on c6 I guess yeah I'll
take<00:01:28.100> back<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.060> then<00:01:29.509> you<00:01:29.899> can<00:01:30.170> get<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.409> poem

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
take back and then you can get a poem

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.700 
take back and then you can get a poem
there<00:01:33.700> but<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.909> wonder<00:01:35.149> if<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:35.659> good<00:01:36.409> for<00:01:36.619> him

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
there but I wonder if it's good for him

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.499 
there but I wonder if it's good for him
because<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.280> all<00:01:37.460> get<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:37.850> open<00:01:38.299> so<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.479> can

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
because it is all get so open so I can

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.779 
because it is all get so open so I can
start<00:01:38.990> attacking<00:01:39.259> in<00:01:39.560> scheme<00:01:39.799> later<00:01:42.789> by

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
start attacking in scheme later by

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.880 
start attacking in scheme later by
playing<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.360> look<00:01:44.930> here<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.560> other<00:01:45.680> one

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
playing I look here and the other one

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.859 
playing I look here and the other one
here<00:01:46.100> for<00:01:46.250> example<00:01:46.340> maybe<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.299> work<00:01:47.479> on<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.720> C

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
here for example maybe I work on the C

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.859 
here for example maybe I work on the C
file<00:01:48.110> I'm<00:01:48.350> already<00:01:49.039> also<00:01:49.610> attacking<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.659> one

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
file I'm already also attacking this one

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.870 
file I'm already also attacking this one
here<00:01:51.170> now<00:01:51.590> I'm<00:01:51.830> also<00:01:51.979> starting<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.430> advance

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
here now I'm also starting to advance

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.969 
here now I'm also starting to advance
its<00:01:53.060> bone<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:53.600> have<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> threat<00:01:54.170> towards

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
its bone and then have a threat towards

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.790 
its bone and then have a threat towards
here<00:01:55.690> now<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> cannot<00:01:57.080> do<00:01:57.289> that<00:01:57.409> right<00:01:57.740> now

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
here now I cannot do that right now

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.370 
here now I cannot do that right now
because<00:01:58.369> then<00:01:58.520> they<00:01:58.640> will<00:01:58.729> play<00:01:59.200> they<00:02:00.200> should

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
because then they will play they should

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.960 
because then they will play they should
be<00:02:00.409> five<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:00.979> i'll<00:02:01.250> do<00:02:01.610> who<00:02:02.409> dat<00:02:03.409> first<00:02:06.970> all

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
be five so i'll do who dat first all

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.690 
be five so i'll do who dat first all
right<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.590> bring<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.739> other<00:02:09.799> one<00:02:09.920> here<00:02:10.310> you

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
probably change one of the works let's

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.320 
probably change one of the works let's
see<00:02:18.549> no<00:02:19.549> he<00:02:20.269> has<00:02:20.510> more<00:02:20.720> time<00:02:20.989> than<00:02:21.170> item<00:02:22.330> okay

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
see no he has more time than item okay

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.150 
see no he has more time than item okay
since<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.410> that's<00:02:24.560> interesting

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
since that one that's interesting

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.300 
since that one that's interesting
because<00:02:25.220> me<00:02:25.810> let's<00:02:26.810> see<00:02:27.049> who<00:02:27.260> could<00:02:27.410> have<00:02:27.560> in

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
because me let's see who could have in

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
because me let's see who could have in
the<00:02:28.489> wastes<00:02:31.030> I'll<00:02:32.030> take<00:02:32.269> this<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.480> then<00:02:32.690> pay

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.320 

only<00:02:40.140> f<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:41.190> very<00:02:41.310> difficult<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.850> talk<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
only f it's very difficult to talk and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.360 
only f it's very difficult to talk and
play<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.630> same<00:02:42.870> time<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:44.040> I'm<00:02:44.160> probably

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
play in the same time that I'm probably

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.910 
play in the same time that I'm probably
not<00:02:45.270> certain<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:46.200> not<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.650> thinking

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
not certain I'm not really thinking

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.220 
not certain I'm not really thinking
about<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.950> position<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> move<00:02:50.670> so

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
about the position on the move so

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.640 
about the position on the move so
somehow<00:02:53.840> probably<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.140> different<00:02:55.470> part

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
somehow probably it's a different part

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800 
somehow probably it's a different part
of<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.800> brain<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.490> use<00:02:56.700> when<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.090> use

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
of the brain that you use when you use

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.520 
of the brain that you use when you use
language<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.530> value<00:02:59.030> play<00:03:00.030> chess<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
language in value play chess but the
