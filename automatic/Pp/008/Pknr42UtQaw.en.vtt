 encrypt file cost files and to protect them 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.559
 files and folders

 practically he packs the disc says which folder or more 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.559
 space arrested present very useful 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.080
 and because I had 28 believe it video 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.799
 that I didn't need 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.799
 I'm looking for a lost folder 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.629
 I would never have found dinner at all now 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.319
 with this disk analysis, however, he immediately showed me that folder 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
 occupied a lot of space 28 gigabytes 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:47.709
 even now some while charging 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.480
 we see implementation 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.099
 it also searches empty folders that is all empty windos folders that sum 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.709
 they only bother crystal as well 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.389
 system tools I didn't even use a used white balloon either 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.629
 but okay if information about the system that demonstrates the hardware the software of the 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.779
 your computer 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:14.189
 or there is always cease it will be like the menager task slanderous against the lime 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.130
 then su stato we are not interested sisi only that free license 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.949
 in the menu as said before there are settings you can also change skins 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:25.580
 inna 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.680
 putting the others, however, it seems 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.819
 hockey run this way over 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.849
 real people from iossa two partitions 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.069
 furs and what we say with cover more space 94% 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.879
 and he gives me what folder in this case a chain of xtina babe I had to 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.199
 all play now 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.660
 however very useful because then you know which folder takes up space 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.809
 7 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.809
 we are there so you couldn't uninstall it 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.889
 we anticipate 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.509
 there is 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.809
 then 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:04.019
 so this appointment of useful programs ended 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.169
 I hope this program is there 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.219
 you are really helpful 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.839
