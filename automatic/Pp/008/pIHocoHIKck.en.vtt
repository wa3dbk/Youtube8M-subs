00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.760 
think that they could do this but they
pulled<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.680> off<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.270> interestingly<00:01:42.619> like<00:01:43.619> they

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
pulled it off so interestingly like they

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.620 
pulled it off so interestingly like they
turn<00:01:43.979> every<00:01:44.430> machine<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> robot<00:01:45.750> -<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> -

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
turn every machine into a robot - and -
