the<00:00:36.890> Air<00:00:37.039> Force<00:00:37.309> marathon<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.030> unique<00:00:38.359> because

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
the Air Force marathon is unique because

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.529 
the Air Force marathon is unique because
it<00:00:38.929> takes<00:00:39.109> place<00:00:39.350> on<00:00:39.649> an<00:00:39.769> active<00:00:40.219> military

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
it takes place on an active military

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.970 
it takes place on an active military
installation<00:00:41.539> access<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.620> base<00:00:42.769> is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
installation access to the base is

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.219 
installation access to the base is
limited<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.640> just<00:00:43.879> three<00:00:44.329> base<00:00:44.539> entry<00:00:44.989> gates

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
limited to just three base entry gates

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.380 
limited to just three base entry gates
so<00:00:45.680> advanced<00:00:46.039> planning<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.609> very<00:00:46.850> important
