00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to small 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.470
 we are entering a blu-ray player today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.409
 feel the tooth of pioneer the pdp 170 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:19.589
 I'm curious what's wrong with it 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:21.749
 delivered with this pioneer blu-ray player 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.310
 of course after coloring a manual with 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.659
 the means to unnecessarily suffer so great 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.519
 device 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:30.019
 sit nicely in Dutch small battery 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.019
 for the remote control 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.780
 power cable nice and long clear 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 remote control 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:55.999
 with separate youtube function and then 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:55.999
 of course play itself well packaged 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.559
 we have the black version here he popped up and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.559
 silver 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.180
 He is a pretty heavy good solid device 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.310
 cynical of those light things here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.080
 would pioneer doing well 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.080
 yes this is that they provide seclusion 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 cabling and of course we play itself 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 choose packs from this bnp dog 70 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.890
 universal this player from pioneer 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.660
 universal this player is not just one 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.920
 blu-ray player no it's a universal 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.660
 display that is, it means much more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.760
 disc eating should just say so 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.350
 then only your thin blue DVD already 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.020
 he also plays CDs and he also plays 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.670
 super audio cd is so this device can 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 really used as high-quality 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.040
 audio player as well as of course 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.800
 video player under your television to DVDs 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 and play blu-ray's 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.520
 possibility of connection of course 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 HDMI HD video and HD sound to TV too 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.050
 but there is also analogue 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 outputs on for sound so that you get the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.130
 player the sound of digital and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 have it decoded analogously and then on 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.980
 your receiver 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.320
 analog signal to get what in 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.630
 and he sounds the best 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 supports numerous formats that you via 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.720
 the USB port on the front or can 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.280
 players also in a movie 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 received per mille for someone and what 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.610
 playing is fun 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.260
 got it in it he plays everything in terms of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.430
 sound also flat 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.190
 videos avc hd divx hd everything plays 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.150
 he wondered he obviously offers through 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.190
 gate 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.720
 that is quite new at page but this one 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.520
 170 has that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 and with the wifi that can be built in 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.370
 So you wirelessly everything via DLNA 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.680
 just wiefie to the player 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.210
 annemie network and he does it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.620
 So you still have a LAN connection so you 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.040
 can also be wired in your network 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.590
 to hang 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.670
 then i also see this player 3d 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.530
 supports 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 we are going to test it anyway 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.450
 back we are now again 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200
 it was a long movie but where you put it 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.670
 have tested 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.209
 but it really does play that cat 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.160
 image quality is certainly not disappointing 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.630
 yes top actually my were real 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.190
 surprised how beautiful that tv this one 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.050
 controversial and dvd really becomes almost 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.760
 on blue this beautiful seat and the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.310
 detailing financially ideal blu-ray 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.170
 knowing pressing is just really good 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.200
 have sound reproduction with music CDs 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 tested there is a dac on board and digit 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.209
 under audio an analog computer and also 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.769
 it certainly does not disappoint 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.080
 when you play super audio CDs 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.480
 when you play music CDs 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.910
 you can use this as a head 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.170
 player he really does very well he is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.760
 not too big then you know my new one 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.290
 so on disc players that they we that big 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.209
 bulky heavy devices 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 this is nice and small so that every 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.830
 cupboard and place you can find 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.360
 wifi stream and worked very well 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.650
 I could use my pioneer app 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.810
 that also worked flawlessly 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.810
 yes top what really very satisfied
