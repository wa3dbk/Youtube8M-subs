now<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.920> chapter<00:00:05.339> 4<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:05.640> will<00:00:06.060> cover<00:00:06.330> the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
now in chapter 4 we will cover the

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.020 
now in chapter 4 we will cover the
kinematics<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.680> circular<00:00:08.160> motion<00:00:08.550> later<00:00:08.790> on

kinematics of circular motion later on
in<00:00:09.269> chapter<00:00:09.719> 6<00:00:10.110> we're<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> study

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
in chapter 6 we're going to study

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.669 
in chapter 6 we're going to study
circular<00:00:12.389> motion<00:00:12.719> more<00:00:12.929> fully<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.590> going

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
circular motion more fully we're going

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.890 
circular motion more fully we're going
to<00:00:13.769> study<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.190> dynamics<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.940> circular<00:00:15.420> motion

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
to study the dynamics of circular motion

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.630 
to study the dynamics of circular motion
we're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.740> more<00:00:16.920> problems<00:00:17.460> with

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
we're going to do more problems with

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.349 
we're going to do more problems with
circular<00:00:18.119> motion<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.320> limited

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
circular motion so this is a limited

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.570 
circular motion so this is a limited
introduction<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.539> circular<00:00:22.470> motion<00:00:22.920> so

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
introduction to circular motion so

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
introduction to circular motion so
kinematics<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:26.599> circular<00:00:27.599> motion<00:00:29.840> we<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
kinematics of circular motion we kind of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
kinematics of circular motion we kind of
already<00:00:31.439> address<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
already address this back in the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
already address this back in the
previous<00:00:34.200> problem<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.160> did<00:00:35.510> remember<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
previous problem that we did remember I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.450 
previous problem that we did remember I
said<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.200> when<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.469> object<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.920> going<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
said that when an object is going in a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.670 
said that when an object is going in a
circle<00:00:38.730> even<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.930> changing<00:00:40.500> its

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
circle even if it is not changing its

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
circle even if it is not changing its
speed<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.910> still<00:00:42.210> accelerating<00:00:42.600> because

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
speed it's still accelerating because

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.040 
speed it's still accelerating because
it's<00:00:43.530> changing<00:00:43.920> its<00:00:44.070> direction<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> when

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it's changing its direction so when

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
it's changing its direction so when
something<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> circle<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.960> has<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
something is going in a circle it has a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
something is going in a circle it has a
certain<00:00:49.559> velocity<00:00:49.890> called<00:00:50.760> tangential

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
certain velocity called tangential

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.760 
certain velocity called tangential
velocity<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:54.809> has<00:00:55.050> an<00:00:55.199> acceleration

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
velocity and it has an acceleration

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.920 
velocity and it has an acceleration
called<00:00:56.219> centripetal<00:00:57.120> acceleration<00:00:59.149> okay<00:01:01.489> a/c

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
called centripetal acceleration okay a/c

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
called centripetal acceleration okay a/c
centripetal<00:01:06.229> equals<00:01:07.229> AC<00:01:07.670> which<00:01:08.670> equals<00:01:09.060> V

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
centripetal equals AC which equals V

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.580 
centripetal equals AC which equals V
squared<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.590> R<00:01:12.290> times<00:01:13.290> negative<00:01:13.979> R<00:01:14.400> hat<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
squared over R times negative R hat and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
squared over R times negative R hat and
remember<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.830> problem<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.700> did<00:01:17.909> we

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
remember in that problem that we did we

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.190 
remember in that problem that we did we
already<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.830> fact<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.729> took<00:01:20.909> its

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
already use that fact we took its

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.719 
already use that fact we took its
instantaneous<00:01:22.200> speed<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
instantaneous speed which is the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
instantaneous speed which is the
velocity<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.390> magnitude<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> velocity

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
velocity the magnitude of the velocity

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
velocity the magnitude of the velocity
vector<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.210> squared<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> we

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
vector and then we squared it and we

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.910 
vector and then we squared it and we
divided<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.890> r<00:01:29.840> by<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.890> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
divided by r by the way this one here is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.490 
divided by r by the way this one here is
not<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> definition<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
not a definition of a see it is the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.569 
not a definition of a see it is the
formula<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.540> provable<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.579> we

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
formula so it is provable and we

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
formula so it is provable and we
actually<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.360> experiments<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> prove<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
actually do experiments to prove it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
actually do experiments to prove it
remember<00:01:41.549> how<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> beginning<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
remember how at the beginning of the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
remember how at the beginning of the
semester<00:01:42.450> i<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:42.810> saying<00:01:43.079> certain<00:01:43.649> things<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
semester i was saying certain things are

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
semester i was saying certain things are
definition<00:01:44.610> certain<00:01:44.970> things<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.390> provable

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
definition certain things are provable

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
definition certain things are provable
this<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> provable<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.420> we

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this one is a provable thing that we

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.899 
this one is a provable thing that we
actually<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.290> an<00:01:49.380> experiment<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.189> prove

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
actually can do an experiment and prove

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.410 
actually can do an experiment and prove
it<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.340> negative<00:01:53.490> R<00:01:53.790> hat<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> means

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it and then negative R hat just means

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.090 
it and then negative R hat just means
they<00:01:54.540> store<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> center<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> object

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
they store the center so when the object

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.370 
they store the center so when the object
comes<00:01:56.579> over<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> velocity

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
comes over here it has a velocity

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.060 
comes over here it has a velocity
tangent<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.729> has<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> centripetal

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
tangent it has a centripetal

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.830 
tangent it has a centripetal
acceleration<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.240> always<00:02:03.509> towards

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
acceleration as well it's always towards

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.029 
acceleration as well it's always towards
the<00:02:03.930> center<00:02:05.060> if<00:02:06.060> its<00:02:06.570> velocity<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the center if its velocity if the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.680 
the center if its velocity if the
magnitude<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> velocity<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.360> not

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
magnitude of the velocity is not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660 
magnitude of the velocity is not
changing<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.619> called<00:02:10.890> uniform<00:02:11.459> circular

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
changing it's called uniform circular

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
changing it's called uniform circular
motion

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
motion

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.990 
motion
if<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.220> magnitude<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.880> velocity<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.599> constant

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
if the magnitude of velocity is constant

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.670 
if the magnitude of velocity is constant
then<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.390> called<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.900> uniform<00:02:19.470> circular

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
then it's called a uniform circular

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:40.070 
then it's called a uniform circular
motion<00:02:36.650> okay<00:02:37.650> but<00:02:38.099> if<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
motion okay but if it is if the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:52.610 
motion okay but if it is if the
magnitude<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.130> changing<00:02:51.110> then<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.380> means

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
magnitude is changing then that means

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.509 
magnitude is changing then that means
there<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.430> tangential<00:02:54.209> acceleration

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
there is a tangential acceleration

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.710 
there is a tangential acceleration
besides<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.670> centripetal<00:02:57.030> acceleration

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
besides the centripetal acceleration

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:13.570 
besides the centripetal acceleration
there's<00:02:57.930> also<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.260> tangential<00:02:58.799> acceleration

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.259 

and<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:16.250> formula<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.280> tangential<00:03:17.910> assertion

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
and the formula for tangential assertion

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.160 
and the formula for tangential assertion
is<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.570> key<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.109> equal<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:20.840> magnitude<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.019> a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
is a key is equal to a magnitude of a

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.460 
is a key is equal to a magnitude of a
key<00:03:22.470> whatever<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.630> x<00:03:24.920> theta<00:03:25.920> hat<00:03:27.470> theta

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
key whatever that is x theta hat theta

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.530 
key whatever that is x theta hat theta
hat<00:03:28.769> remember<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.430> polar<00:03:29.670> coordinates<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.510> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
hat remember in polar coordinates is a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.729 
hat remember in polar coordinates is a
vector<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.940> uh<00:03:33.140> who's<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> unit

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
vector that is that is uh who's a unit

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.210 
vector that is that is uh who's a unit
vector<00:03:34.910> which<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.200> going<00:03:37.200> along<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.739> circle

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
vector which is going along the circle

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.490 
vector which is going along the circle
so<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.850> tangential<00:03:39.660> will<00:03:39.900> look<00:03:40.049> something<00:03:40.260> like

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
so a tangential will look something like

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.849 
so a tangential will look something like
this<00:03:44.000> okay<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.720> goes<00:03:45.959> along<00:03:46.139> with<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:48.859> it

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
this okay it's it goes along with the it

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.300 
this okay it's it goes along with the it
goes<00:03:50.100> along<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.850> objects<00:03:51.389> motion<00:03:52.310> okay

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
goes along with the objects motion okay

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.550 
goes along with the objects motion okay
and<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:56.639> magnitude<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.540> tangential<00:03:58.170> could

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
and the magnitude of a tangential could

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.819 
and the magnitude of a tangential could
either<00:03:58.769> be<00:03:59.130> changing<00:03:59.730> or<00:03:59.970> constant<00:04:00.829> write

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
centripetal vector the a total vector

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.840 
centripetal vector the a total vector
will<00:06:17.419> look<00:06:17.570> like<00:06:17.780> this<00:06:21.220> in<00:06:22.220> other<00:06:22.400> words<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:22.820> a

will look like this in other words the a
total<00:06:23.300> vector<00:06:23.660> is<00:06:23.780> telling<00:06:24.169> you<00:06:24.289> what<00:06:24.590> are<00:06:24.710> the

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
total vector is telling you what are the

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.980 
total vector is telling you what are the
total<00:06:25.280> forces<00:06:25.580> on<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:25.970> car<00:06:26.150> as<00:06:26.330> it's<00:06:26.720> going

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
total forces on the car as it's going

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.010 
total forces on the car as it's going
around<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.349> circle<00:06:28.060> if<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.330> op<00:06:29.419> if<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.810> car

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
around the circle if the op if the car

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.570 
around the circle if the op if the car
is<00:06:30.169> accelerating

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
is accelerating

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.550 
is accelerating
then<00:06:31.759> those<00:06:32.000> total<00:06:32.330> forces<00:06:32.599> are<00:06:32.870> provided<00:06:33.409> by

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
then those total forces are provided by

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.420 
then those total forces are provided by
the<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:34.370> engine<00:06:34.789> and<00:06:34.909> the<00:06:35.740> friction<00:06:36.740> force<00:06:37.099> on

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
the the engine and the friction force on

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.480 
the the engine and the friction force on
the<00:06:37.580> tires<00:06:38.080> and<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.259> friction<00:06:40.129> force<00:06:40.280> is

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
the tires and the friction force is

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.580 
the tires and the friction force is
pushing<00:06:40.699> in<00:06:40.969> on<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.180> tires<00:06:41.419> the<00:06:42.110> engine<00:06:42.469> is

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
pushing in on the tires the engine is

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.679 
pushing in on the tires the engine is
pushing<00:06:43.009> forward<00:06:43.460> on<00:06:43.639> the<00:06:43.789> tires<00:06:44.030> so<00:06:44.330> that's<00:06:44.569> a

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
pushing forward on the tires so that's a

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.679 
pushing forward on the tires so that's a
total<00:06:45.169> acceleration<00:06:45.590> of<00:06:46.039> the<00:06:46.069> car<00:06:46.509> okay<00:06:47.509> and

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:47.689 
total acceleration of the car okay and

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:50.439 
total acceleration of the car okay and
then<00:06:48.409> the<00:06:48.560> angle<00:06:49.009> of<00:06:49.159> the<00:06:49.250> total<00:06:50.210> acceleration

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
then the angle of the total acceleration

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.330 
then the angle of the total acceleration
is<00:06:50.990> measured<00:06:51.530> with<00:06:51.560> respect<00:06:51.740> to<00:06:52.219> the

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
is measured with respect to the

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.879 
is measured with respect to the
centripetal<00:06:52.729> acceleration<00:06:53.740> so<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:55.039> theta<00:06:56.889> is

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
centripetal acceleration so the theta is

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:06.279 
centripetal acceleration so the theta is
equal<00:06:58.189> to<00:06:58.639> tan<00:06:58.939> inverse<00:06:58.969> of<00:06:59.840> a<00:07:02.860> tangential<00:07:04.870> /<00:07:05.870> a

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
equal to tan inverse of a tangential / a

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:13.959 
equal to tan inverse of a tangential / a
centripetal<00:07:10.629> see<00:07:11.629> the<00:07:11.960> theta<00:07:12.379> is<00:07:12.710> the<00:07:12.969> tan

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:13.969 
centripetal see the theta is the tan

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:15.909 
centripetal see the theta is the tan
inverse<00:07:14.210> of<00:07:14.449> the<00:07:14.599> tangential<00:07:15.169> over<00:07:15.740> the

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
inverse of the tangential over the

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.899 
inverse of the tangential over the
centripetal<00:07:16.669> opposite<00:07:17.539> over<00:07:17.629> adjacent<00:07:18.909> okay

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:19.909 
centripetal opposite over adjacent okay

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:26.499 
centripetal opposite over adjacent okay
