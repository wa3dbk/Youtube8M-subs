00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.860 

and<00:01:10.160> I<00:01:10.490> think<00:01:10.550> those<00:01:10.850> two<00:01:10.880> corners<00:01:11.390> are<00:01:11.510> just

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
and I think those two corners are just

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.200 
and I think those two corners are just
enough<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.440> Hamlin<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:13.460> get<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:14.390> keep<00:01:14.540> that<00:01:16.210> if

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
enough for Hamlin to get to keep that if

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:43.450 
enough for Hamlin to get to keep that if
we<00:01:17.360> get<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.600> white<00:01:17.750> flag<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:20.050> finish<00:01:42.369> just<00:01:43.369> a
