00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
always in that mode where you're writing
the<00:01:45.240> next<00:01:45.450> record<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.320> travel<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the next record as you as you travel I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
the next record as you as you travel I
guess<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.390> during<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
guess not really not really during the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.350 
guess not really not really during the
two-year<00:01:49.860> process<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.520> tearing<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.270> it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
two-year process of tearing I think it's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
two-year process of tearing I think it's
towards<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> end<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.649> touring

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
towards the end of that to your touring

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.310 
towards the end of that to your touring
cycle<00:01:53.520> that's<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> start<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.200> get

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
cycle that's when you start to get

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
cycle that's when you start to get
excited<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:55.860> playing<00:01:56.369> new<00:01:56.579> songs<00:01:56.850> because

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
excited about playing new songs because

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.880 
excited about playing new songs because
you've<00:01:57.689> been<00:01:57.719> playing<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> old<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.710> much

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you've been playing the old one so much

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.749 
you've been playing the old one so much
on<00:01:59.070> tour<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.600> you<00:02:00.770> get<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.799> right<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
on tour and you get like right now is a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.910 
on tour and you get like right now is a
time<00:02:03.030> where<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.229> motivated<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
time where I'm not really motivated to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.139 
time where I'm not really motivated to
write<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.189> all<00:02:05.250> because<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.759> such<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
write at all because it was just such a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.109 
write at all because it was just such a
long<00:02:06.450> laborious<00:02:06.750> process<00:02:07.200> right<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.190> right

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
long laborious process right and right

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
long laborious process right and right
now<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.750> fun<00:02:10.140> time<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.649> go<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.550> on

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
now is like the fun time to go get up on

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.220 
now is like the fun time to go get up on
stage<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.030> play<00:02:12.209> these<00:02:12.390> songs<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
stage and play these songs and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
stage and play these songs and
and<00:02:13.500> it'll<00:02:14.010> probably<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and it'll probably be like this for the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.339 
and it'll probably be like this for the
next<00:02:14.970> six<00:02:15.330> months<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:15.810> eventually<00:02:15.989> get

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
next six months and then eventually get

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.009 
next six months and then eventually get
bored<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> start<00:02:16.950> dueling<00:02:17.580> around<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.930> new

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
bored and start dueling around for new

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.710 
bored and start dueling around for new

now<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.190> long<00:02:38.220> time<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.970> it's

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
now that I have in a long time it's it's

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.900 
now that I have in a long time it's it's
I<00:02:39.599> don't<00:02:40.560> know<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:41.010> seems<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.370> fun<00:02:41.730> and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.309 
I don't know it seems really fun and
energized<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.569> guess<00:02:42.720> having<00:02:42.900> new<00:02:43.079> songs

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
