00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 very good to all the kids I am 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.360
 minimum 10 and they bring in scoop the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.000
 hidden recordings in transit mode 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.820
 there I told you in the live that he did 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 imp that good that there were some 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.129
 recordings that nobody had yet 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.900
 discovered on the map of trÃ nsit and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 good that they were necessary ok for 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.160
 understand the story a little better and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.000
 I'm the first youtube in Spanish 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 upload it and thanks to frank kelly and a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 friend more then we have discovered where 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.729
 are these recordings worth I'm going to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.589
 put 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.290
 I will not put where they are since 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.420
 we want to reserve the secret for when 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.580
 let's have the complete easter egg and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.460
 well here you can see all we thought 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 that the cafe map that is there 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.080
 down was the hidden map but finally 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.940
 it's not like it's cafeteria vale is the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.619
 coffee shop as you can see here in the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.909
 map this case I have put and good before 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.960
 I'll show you one 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.940
 curiosity is worth 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.369
 so you can see that there really is a map 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.340
 hidden or that we think is worth and good 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.850
 listen carefully what it says what 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 says the driver when going up you are worth 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 700 contracted 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.530
 you see all your personal items and 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.390
 occupy their seats we left towards the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 research station hardware 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 how could you hear the driver 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 takes us to the research center 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 heart good now we will see what it says 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.590
 Here it nothing but leaves the tunnel os 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.590
 I let you hear it, we are still worth 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.340
 cabbage 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 do not 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 the driver says that there has been a 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.850
 error and you had to change the route 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 I do not stay there and I wanted to find out 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.740
 Why is this error good? 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 seems to be coming for this now 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.250
 you will see 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.510
 here comes the bus 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.540
 and good will here and say what the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.599
 error 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.079
 and as you can see the error says it 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.670
 just when it reaches this stretch 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.599
 good as you can check the error 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:01.189
 it seems that it occurs because of this 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.500
 car that clogs the road with 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.450
 those sacks is worth it and that there must be 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.940
 the hard research station 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.540
 we assume that it will have to be unlocked 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.239
 with the stage and well this is all now 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.000
 we do with the recordings I hope that 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.040
 I have helped you for something and 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.190
 good to like favorites and even the 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.190
 next 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.610
 m 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 I realized that he had never seen 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.590
 in a hurry 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.569
 and they could threaten the whole planet that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.049
 it was not the intention although with a 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.090
 possible plan b just in case this plan 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.620
 would consist of creating 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.610
 polarization devices like the ter 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.099
 why I have trouble speaking 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.549
 positive when the energy cut the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.549
 Energy 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.530
 ah 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.390
 here you play back now we see any 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.180
 human community within reach of emission 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.160
 that we are established coordinates of 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.630
 breast cancer 37 grams that 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.490
 recently in 1906 that this is a 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.700
 warning to anyone who receives the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.700
 mysterious call 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.020
 they started well 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.390
 3 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.380
 crisis methods 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.380
 Y 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.370
 Y 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.430
 those who are not persecuted but more 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.430
 to live in the years of roses 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.380
 no no 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.380
 ah 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.850
 if he lives there 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.840
 yes 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:59.440
 one of them but 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.440
 no no no 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:08.080
 if there are no cows 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.500
 as you said but we can not beat your 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.500
 numerical superiority long time 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.589
 to
