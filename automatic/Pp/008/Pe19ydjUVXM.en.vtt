00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 Sunday of autumn, nine of the night Sitting in my room and thinking ... 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.430
 What time hides. 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.380
 Looking at the photos, reading your letters Shouting your name ... 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.529
 Sunday of autumn, nine of the night ... 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:39.910
 A moment ago you called me, after so many years ... 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.420
 Maybe your conscience and my patience ... They have become allies 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.579
 You tell me that at this moment you would like to be here ... by my side 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.430
 By my sideâ€¦ 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.769
 And I, I even smile ... For not starting to cry 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.100
 You've had so much time ... And you have not wanted to go back 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.399
 At a good hour ... You come to tell me that I am that person, 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:21.630
 who has been able to give you what the heart does not erase 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.300
 Now you're wrong ... 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:38.740
 At a good hour, you come to heal the soul that you left broken 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:54.640
 And to change my life because now you crave ... At a good time ... 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:06.659
 Sunday of autumn nine at night The mother experience told me ... 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.580
 That I no longer agree The time and the years place one where 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.680
 corresponds ... What is born pure also gets corrupted 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.290
 And you, how dare you again, to turn back? 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.209
 You've had so much time ... You better stay as you are ... 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.510
 Let me say ... what ... 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.312
 At a good hour ... You come to tell me that I am that person, 

00:02:38.312 --> 00:02:39.312
 who has been able to give you what the heart does not erase 

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:40.312
 Now you're wrong ... 

00:02:40.312 --> 00:02:41.312
 At a good hour, you come to heal the soul that you left broken 

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:41.325
 And to change my life because now you crave ... At a good time ...
