in<00:00:26.430> my<00:00:26.640> opinion<00:00:27.740> basically<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:29.189> gave<00:00:29.340> us<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
in my opinion basically they gave us a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
in my opinion basically they gave us a
ballpark<00:00:29.789> figure<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:30.900> start

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
ballpark figure of when it will start

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
ballpark figure of when it will start

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
you can what is a beta event a baby
event<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.870> tailored<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
event is something that we tailored to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
event is something that we tailored to
test<00:00:52.800> certain<00:00:53.129> things<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> game<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
test certain things in the game will it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
test certain things in the game will it
be<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> specific<00:00:55.020> area<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> game<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> feature

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
be a specific area of the game a feature

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
be a specific area of the game a feature
or<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.730> gameplay<00:00:57.270> element<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.289> they're<00:00:58.469> going

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
or I gameplay element so they're going

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.040 
or I gameplay element so they're going
to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:58.829> tailored<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.460> certain<00:00:59.699> things

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
to be very tailored to certain things

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.599 
to be very tailored to certain things
another<00:01:01.050> question<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> answer<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.370> long

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
another question the answer is how long

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.149 
another question the answer is how long
will<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> events<00:01:03.539> events<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.500> held<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
will the events events be held for and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.630 
will the events events be held for and
they<00:01:05.970> said<00:01:06.530> they'll<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:08.070> limited<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
they said they'll be very limited and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600 
they said they'll be very limited and
have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.659> certain<00:01:09.990> time<00:01:10.229> time<00:01:10.799> frame<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
have a certain time time frame so it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
have a certain time time frame so it
might<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> weekend<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> might<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> day<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
might be a weekend it might be a day it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.399 
might be a weekend it might be a day it
might<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.159> during<00:01:14.460> peak<00:01:14.670> hours<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.780> like

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
might be during peak hours just like

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
might be during peak hours just like
most<00:01:16.619> games<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.159> test<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.640> things

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
most games just test different things

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.289 
most games just test different things
and<00:01:19.130> another<00:01:20.130> thing<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.729> many<00:01:20.790> testers

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and another thing is how many testers

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
and another thing is how many testers
will<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.570> invited<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.500> pretty

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
will be invited this was pretty

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
will be invited this was pretty
interesting<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.729> basically<00:01:24.090> stated<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
interesting they basically stated that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
interesting they basically stated that
they're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> inviting<00:01:26.189> smaller

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
they're going to be inviting smaller

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
they're going to be inviting smaller
groups<00:01:26.759> during<00:01:27.150> March<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> April<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.259> then

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
groups during March and April and then

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640 
groups during March and April and then
as<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.640> approach<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.869> launch<00:01:31.079> date<00:01:31.320> they'll

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
as they approach the launch date they'll

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.370 
as they approach the launch date they'll
have<00:01:31.829> bigger<00:01:32.310> betas<00:01:32.909> having<00:01:33.810> their<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> VA

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have bigger betas having their a VA

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.890 
have bigger betas having their a VA
tested<00:01:35.040> likely<00:01:35.640> requires<00:01:36.000> thousands<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
tested likely requires thousands of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
tested likely requires thousands of
participants<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.950> stress<00:01:38.640> tests<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.240> be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
participants and stress tests will be

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 
participants and stress tests will be
even<00:01:39.619> larger<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> mean<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:42.090> sign<00:01:42.240> up

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
even larger so I mean just sign up

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
even larger so I mean just sign up
because<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.049> will<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.100> most

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because you will get in but you most

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819 
because you will get in but you most
likely<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> beta<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.229> once<00:01:46.710> they

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
likely get into a beta it once they

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.609 
likely get into a beta it once they
start<00:01:47.070> testing<00:01:47.460> their<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> VA<00:01:48.329> system<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
start testing their a VA system and you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.090 
start testing their a VA system and you
