 West of Paris in a loft become 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.069
 too small for their couple and their

 two nicolas and julien children 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.799

 this house there is a little more than four 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 years in 2009 we had a shot of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730
 heart especially for the potential of this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 house that had a real a beautiful 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 surface on the ground floor there was a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
 hairdressing goods store we see 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 that it was closed for several 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.359
 years with office reserve workshops and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 he has preceded two apartments first 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 on the second floor which really gave 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.559
 opportunities to do something 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.680
 of interesting and this house we 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 bring both space and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.770
 outside that is to say from terrace a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
 garden so what to live pleasantly 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.350
 having a surface of 320 meters 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.750
 squares on two floors 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.300
 karina everything is cloisonné to create a 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.840
 loft house the works have so lasted 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 nine months 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.360
 on the ground floor you have about 160 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 170 m² we go to ten so there were two 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.670
 shops 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.750
 we transformed with walls into 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.109
 bedrock and large bays 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.270
 picture 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.880
 we did a guest room and a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.320
 office 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.460
 he 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.800
 here you have a reservation to 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.190
 completely pink there was no point 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.600
 luminous 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.510
 we created skylights 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 to bring direct light these 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.630
 skylight overlooks the terrace 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.120
 of dairy products and allow to benefit 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.920
 free contributions from the sun she 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.690
 no high level perspective had so 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.080
 we did everything to make a great 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.080
 space 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.010
 we 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.960
 a very small glass door and that 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 walls facing the outside and we have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.900
 modified to have large berries 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.400
 glazed and a lot more light that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:48.630
 return with a view his garden more 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:50.100
 nice we kept the harkis are 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 carriers inside you had some 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 shelving which constitutes the reserves 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.030
 city ​​so we broke all the shelves 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 we kept only structures on 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.690
 did a little bar here for them the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.300
 transition for more usability 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.920
 deco karine chose an interior 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.560
 contemporary with materials 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.649
 comfortable 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.350
 we went on a black kitchen so 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.590
 at still very dark and black lacquered 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.240
 a black parking so from there we have 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.280
 makes a choice to approach real estate 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.070
 still pretty clear white tables 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.060
 white carpet for still makes a 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.650
 brighter and warmer appearance 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.730
 karin and because they took advantage of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.510
 work to save money 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.849
 energy 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.920
 they entrusted this project to a 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.739
 entrepreneur all state bodies that has 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 completely redone the insulation 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.430
 we started by doubling the walls with 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.400
 a thermal dubbing will be police 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.489
 she places them where were also isolated 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.019
 with only 10 cm glass wool 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.150
 the south pinyin was isolated by 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.900
 outside with expanded polystyrene 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.989
 8 cm and talent or the hot side 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.510
 west so we took advantage of the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.310
 sunshine to precisely put 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.799
 age groups create and bring 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.610
 light and so I say suddenly 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.299
 his desires and his double glazing 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.299
 thermal and phonic 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.560
 electricity was actually 90% we got 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.569
 concert with some of the electricity 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.430
 from the basement there up and heating 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.650
 existing floor of the house by a 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.390
 condensing gas boiler is this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.940
 god is programmable and connected to 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.560
 extra flat radiators 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.530
 the work cost 350 thousand euros 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.150
 for 320.1 square kilometers of living space 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.680
 made of mayotte of 1100 euros tidal bore 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.600
 for the interior we continue the visit 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.880
 with karin who makes us discover the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.390
 spaces night they were fully 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.720
 redeveloped was also hot at first 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.810
 floor 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.340
 it is however an apartment so we 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.020
 let's give you a little spirit 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.090
 little parental 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.820
 we have removed the corridor that has 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.200
 closeted to the bathroom and it got us 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.220
 allowed to access the hall of 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.620
 bath by our room 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.630
 the part stay that they bring to your 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.420
 feel good in dressing the dining room 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.170
 in a room and in a small salon which has 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.170
 grew up our room 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.340
 I had a chirac had not developed 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.880
 at all the summer in addition it was not 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.430
 everything done 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.710
 it was raining your living room so we have 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.930
 redo all the anxiety protesters to 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.510
 7 terraces you give in our room 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.220
 and to be able to have more access 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.840
 nice we took a staircase 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.420
 pass from the terrace of the ground floor 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.760
 to that of the first of two terraces 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.100
 are recyclable composite wood and 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.570
 offers two benefits longevity and 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.180
 ease of maintenance 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.210
 it overlooks a garden of 240 meters 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.210
 square 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.520

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.420
 it is also an apartment 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.920

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.690
 we created so of course everyone at

 basement is a glass wall its sound 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.040
 workshop so that the sun 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.300
 return to the east to the west 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.950
 all day is very bright 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.690
 thanks to this exposure to very 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.370
 sunny we really have a nice contribution 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.470
 of light that allows us to make 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.360
 energy savings of curtains and 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.400
 stocks also helps to protect against 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.940
 sun and keep the feet is over 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.580
