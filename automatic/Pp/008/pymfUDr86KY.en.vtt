00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.109 
nothing in all clothes this is a
physical<00:01:56.909> wall<00:01:57.630> Zapdos<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.090> very

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
physical wall Zapdos and it's not very

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
physical wall Zapdos and it's not very
effective<00:02:00.420> whatever<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.590> finishes<00:02:01.860> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
effective whatever and it finishes it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.679 
effective whatever and it finishes it
off<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> heat<00:02:02.369> wave<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.149> nice<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
off for the heat wave so nice in the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
off for the heat wave so nice in the
gengar<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.560> goes<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> Shadow<00:02:05.250> Ball

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
gengar and it goes for the Shadow Ball

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.059 
gengar and it goes for the Shadow Ball
and<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.140> quite<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.799> damage

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and it does quite a lot of damage

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.790 
and it does quite a lot of damage
actually

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
actually

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.370 
actually
so<00:02:10.430> that<00:02:10.610> leads<00:02:11.210> me<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.450> think<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.660> he<00:02:11.840> specs

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
so that leads me to think that he specs

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.930 
so that leads me to think that he specs
now<00:02:12.650> instead<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:15.560> normal<00:02:16.460> game<00:02:16.700> guard

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
now instead of a normal game guard

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.910 
now instead of a normal game guard
meeting<00:02:17.180> he's<00:02:17.450> probably<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:18.020> hypnosis<00:02:18.380> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
meeting he's probably have hypnosis and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.740 
meeting he's probably have hypnosis and
he's<00:02:19.310> brought<00:02:19.490> anyways<00:02:19.910> he's<00:02:20.090> locked<00:02:20.270> into

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
he's brought anyways he's locked into

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.800 
he's brought anyways he's locked into
shadow<00:02:21.110> ball<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.920> now<00:02:22.010> i<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:22.630> milotic<00:02:23.630> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
shadow ball so now i go into milotic and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.870 
shadow ball so now i go into milotic and
it<00:02:24.080> takes<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> ball<00:02:24.710> pretty<00:02:25.430> well<00:02:25.550> because

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it takes out a ball pretty well because

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.990 
it takes out a ball pretty well because
it's<00:02:26.240> such<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.080> beast<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:30.430> he<00:02:31.430> decided<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.790> go

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's such a beast and he decided to go

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.920 
it's such a beast and he decided to go
into<00:02:32.320> audio<00:02:33.320> cistern<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:35.000> set<00:02:35.210> up<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> light

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
into audio cistern and I set up a light

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.420 
into audio cistern and I set up a light
screen<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.640> now<00:02:38.470> he's<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.500> Wells<00:02:39.950> on<00:02:40.190> me<00:02:40.280> with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
screen so now he's just Wells on me with

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.070 
screen so now he's just Wells on me with
Thunderbolts<00:02:41.060> while<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.740> tried<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:43.930> take<00:02:44.930> him

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
Thunderbolts while I tried to take him

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.890 
Thunderbolts while I tried to take him
out<00:02:45.200> with<00:02:45.440> toxic<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.100> stuff<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.150> he

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
out with toxic and stuff like that so he

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.710 
out with toxic and stuff like that so he
basically<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.410> Thunderbolts<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.370> my<00:02:50.300> toxic

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
basically just Thunderbolts and my toxic

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.190 
basically just Thunderbolts and my toxic
mist<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.280> thunderpuss<00:02:52.700> again<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.450> now<00:02:54.170> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
mist and I thunderpuss again and now I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.570 
mist and I thunderpuss again and now I
toxic<00:02:54.860> lands<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:59.170> now<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.200> go<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.980> recover<00:03:01.460> i

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
toxic lands and now I go for a recover i

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.010 
toxic lands and now I go for a recover i
think<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.090> turn<00:03:07.120> instead<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.300> bolts<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.690> i

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
think this turn instead of bolts in i

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.240 
think this turn instead of bolts in i
recover<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.180> go<00:03:14.360> faster

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
recover and this is go faster

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.839 
recover and this is go faster
hmm<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> now<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:21.680> go<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> surf<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.520> think<00:03:23.730> this

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
hmm so now I go for a surf I think this

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.720 
hmm so now I go for a surf I think this
turn<00:03:24.060> why<00:03:24.209> Thunderbolts<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.230> was<00:03:25.349> like

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
turn why Thunderbolts and it was like

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.530 
turn why Thunderbolts and it was like
almost<00:03:26.730> nothing<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:28.459> with<00:03:29.459> toxic<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.300> would

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
almost nothing but with toxic it would

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.140 
almost nothing but with toxic it would
like<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.830> after<00:03:32.069> few<00:03:32.430> turns<00:03:32.670> would<00:03:32.910> help

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
like you know after few turns would help

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.910 
like you know after few turns would help
kill<00:03:33.569> him<00:03:33.690> off<00:03:33.750> after<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.200> guess<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.739> i<00:03:34.770> just

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
kill him off after I guess so i just

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.510 
kill him off after I guess so i just
want<00:03:35.069> with<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> surf<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.680> now<00:03:37.680> toxic<00:03:38.190> started

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
want with the surf and now toxic started

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.180 
want with the surf and now toxic started
to<00:03:38.580> take<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:38.900> big<00:03:39.900> chunk<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.380> his<00:03:40.500> life<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.160> he

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
to take like big chunk of his life so he

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.309 
to take like big chunk of his life so he
decides<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.640> switch<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:42.060> into<00:03:42.540> his<00:03:42.870> gang<00:03:43.140> car

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319

and i set up another light screen

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.800 
and i set up another light screen
because<00:03:45.900> previous<00:03:46.470> turn<00:03:46.650> my<00:03:46.980> screen<00:03:47.280> failed

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
because previous turn my screen failed

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.090 
because previous turn my screen failed
and<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:50.269> it's<00:03:51.269> Thunder<00:03:51.569> bolts<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.200> with

and now it's Thunder bolts and with
flyscreen<00:03:53.550> up<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.150> does<00:03:54.330> a<00:03:54.890> very<00:03:55.890> small<00:03:56.790> amount

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
flyscreen up it does a very small amount

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.600 
flyscreen up it does a very small amount
of<00:03:57.180> damage<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.989> go<00:03:58.140> for<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.380> surf<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.280> if

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
of damage and I go for the surf and if

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.350 
of damage and I go for the surf and if
it<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.970> him<00:04:00.060> off<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.489> he<00:04:05.549> sings<00:04:05.880> in<00:04:06.060> his<00:04:06.180> ray

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
coup and I switch into zapdos because I

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.120 
coup and I switch into zapdos because I
was<00:04:12.060> predicting<00:04:12.900> him<00:04:13.230> doing<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.650> thunderbolt

damage<00:04:26.520> my<00:04:26.820> team<00:04:27.000> but<00:04:27.150> have<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.419> decide<00:04:27.630> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
damage my team but have to decide to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
damage my team but have to decide to
switch<00:04:27.810> out<00:04:28.050> for<00:04:28.229> some<00:04:28.350> odd<00:04:28.500> reason<00:04:28.530> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
switch out for some odd reason and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.140 
switch out for some odd reason and

brings in that tyranitar while I get a
roost<00:04:33.360> off<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:36.180> now<00:04:36.560> predicting<00:04:37.560> an

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
roost off so now predicting an

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
earthquake since I Bruce did I go to

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.120 
earthquake since I Bruce did I go to
Stella<00:04:39.780> B<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.110> he<00:04:40.200> had<00:04:40.289> to<00:04:40.440> go<00:04:40.560> for<00:04:40.740> stone<00:04:40.979> edge

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
Stella B but he had to go for stone edge

Stella B but he had to go for stone edge
noise<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:44.250> um<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:46.470> i<00:04:46.500> go<00:04:46.860> for<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.160> grass<00:04:47.430> not

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
noise and um now i go for the grass not

noise and um now i go for the grass not
and<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:49.229> does<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:50.039> little<00:04:50.940> over<00:04:51.240> half<00:04:51.450> i<00:04:51.660> think

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and it does a little over half i think

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.440 
and it does a little over half i think
which<00:04:52.229> surprised<00:04:53.220> me<00:04:53.490> because<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.850> don't<00:04:54.030> tire

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
which surprised me because I don't tire

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.740 
which surprised me because I don't tire
natars<00:04:54.750> suppress<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.680> fence<00:04:56.240> are<00:04:57.240> pretty

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
natars suppress the fence are pretty

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.990 
natars suppress the fence are pretty
high<00:04:58.020> especially<00:04:58.770> if<00:04:59.070> it's<00:04:59.370> since<00:04:59.700> all<00:04:59.910> my

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
high especially if it's since all my

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.450 
high especially if it's since all my
stuff<00:05:00.180> like<00:05:00.300> that

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
stuff like that

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.330 
stuff like that
and<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.150> go<00:05:02.240> through<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.449> fire<00:05:02.690> punch<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.340> it

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
and you go through a fire punch and it

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.420 
and you go through a fire punch and it
doesn't<00:05:04.699> do<00:05:04.850> a<00:05:05.090> lot<00:05:06.050> of<00:05:06.319> damage<00:05:06.590> compared<00:05:07.340> to

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
doesn't do a lot of damage compared to

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.559 
doesn't do a lot of damage compared to
what<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.639> thought<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:08.180> would<00:05:08.270> have<00:05:08.389> done<00:05:08.509> with

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
what I thought it would have done with

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.760 
what I thought it would have done with
like<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.900> crunch<00:05:09.259> or<00:05:09.410> something<00:05:10.180> but<00:05:11.560> he<00:05:12.560> goes

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
like a crunch or something but he goes

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.110 
like a crunch or something but he goes
in<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.160> rake<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:13.550> now<00:05:13.729> and<00:05:14.139> grass<00:05:15.139> not<00:05:15.380> does<00:05:15.650> I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
in to rake you now and grass not does I

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.370 
in to rake you now and grass not does I
pretty<00:05:17.120> nice<00:05:17.270> chunk<00:05:17.660> of<00:05:17.750> damage<00:05:18.080> because

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
pretty nice chunk of damage because

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.999 
pretty nice chunk of damage because
raikou<00:05:19.069> is<00:05:19.250> pretty<00:05:20.090> big<00:05:20.270> looking<00:05:20.599> well<00:05:20.750> c'mon

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
raikou is pretty big looking well c'mon

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.480 
raikou is pretty big looking well c'mon
so<00:05:22.009> I<00:05:23.560> decided<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.680> stay<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.250> do<00:05:25.310> some<00:05:25.460> more

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
so I decided to stay in and do some more

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.370 
so I decided to stay in and do some more
grass<00:05:25.759> knots<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:26.389> he<00:05:26.720> goes<00:05:26.900> for<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.110> shadow

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
grass knots but he goes for a shadow

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.350 
grass knots but he goes for a shadow
ball<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.509> does<00:05:29.750> quite<00:05:30.139> a<00:05:30.199> lot<00:05:30.500> of<00:05:30.650> damage

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
ball and it does quite a lot of damage

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.520 
ball and it does quite a lot of damage
so<00:05:32.360> I'm<00:05:32.479> not<00:05:32.569> gonna<00:05:32.690> be<00:05:32.780> able<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:32.990> get<00:05:33.110> off<00:05:33.259> a

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
so I'm not gonna be able to get off a

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.460 
so I'm not gonna be able to get off a
third<00:05:33.860> graph<00:05:34.099> not<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.460> finish<00:05:34.580> them<00:05:34.820> off<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:36.080> I

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
third graph not to finish them off so I

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.839 
third graph not to finish them off so I
just<00:05:36.740> leave<00:05:36.889> settle<00:05:37.220> being<00:05:37.460> so<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.180> can<00:05:39.849> be

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
just leave settle being so that I can be

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.339 
just leave settle being so that I can be
able<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.090> safely<00:05:41.389> bring<00:05:41.750> in<00:05:41.930> one<00:05:42.229> of<00:05:42.259> my

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
able to safely bring in one of my

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.790 
able to safely bring in one of my
sweepers<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.930> he<00:05:44.930> finishes<00:05:45.320> me<00:05:45.500> off<00:05:45.530> with<00:05:45.770> a

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
sweepers and he finishes me off with a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.080 
sweepers and he finishes me off with a
shadow<00:05:46.130> ball<00:05:46.780> so<00:05:47.780> I'm<00:05:47.930> able<00:05:48.199> to<00:05:48.500> send<00:05:48.860> in<00:05:49.070> um<00:05:49.550> a
