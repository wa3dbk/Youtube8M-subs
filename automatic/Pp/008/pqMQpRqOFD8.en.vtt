all<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:06.170> probably<00:01:07.170> can't<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
all right I probably can't do this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.510 
all right I probably can't do this
without<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:08.130> super<00:01:08.610> nemikhay<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
without going super nemikhay and the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.190 
without going super nemikhay and the
special<00:01:11.880> beam<00:01:12.000> cannon<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.810> isn't<00:01:13.110> doing

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
special beam cannon just isn't doing

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.740 
special beam cannon just isn't doing
enough<00:01:13.380> damage<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.509> save

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
enough damage so I'm just going to save

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.249 
enough damage so I'm just going to save
the<00:01:15.960> energy<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:18.259> super

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the energy because when you go super

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.210 
the energy because when you go super
namak<00:01:19.560> um<00:01:20.490> he<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.420> refill<00:01:21.990> hell<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.560> think<00:01:23.130> he

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
namak um he can refill hell I think he

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.390 
namak um he can refill hell I think he
replaces<00:01:23.820> health<00:01:24.060> uh<00:01:25.700> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.290 

energy<00:01:30.530> what<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.620> they<00:01:31.650> call<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:31.950> key<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.610> think

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
energy what do they call it key I think

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.280 
energy what do they call it key I think
it's<00:01:33.840> been<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> while<00:01:34.230> guys<00:01:34.430> but<00:01:35.430> yeah<00:01:35.640> um<00:01:36.290> your
