00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.900
- THIS IS THE FINAL DAY
OF CAT WEEK.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
[cheers and applause]

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:11.166
[rousing fanfare]

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.633
[man imitates meow]

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.833
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE CHEERING
'CAUSE IT'S THE FINAL DAY

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.733
OR THAT YOU'RE HERE
FOR IT.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.666
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S DAY FIVE OF CAT WEEK,

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.333
AND IT'S BROUGHT TO YOU
BY LASER POINTERS.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.666
[harp glissandos]

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.833
YUP.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.066
NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.733
FOR CATS TO CHASE
WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THOSE,

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:32.333
BUT REMEMBER, NEVER POINT THEM
IN A CATS' EYE OR YOUR EYE

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.766
LIKE GINA IS DOING NOW.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.500
GINA, DON'T DO THAT.
- WHAT'S THAT?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.866
- I SAID
YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.466
- THIS ONE?
- OKAY, NO.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.600
ALL RIGHT, A SPECIAL THANKS
TO OUR OFFICIAL SPONSOR

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.433
LITTER GENIE.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.100
NO, IT'S THE OTHER WAY.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
[applause]

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.800
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
IT CAN HURT YOUR EYESIGHT.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.300
YOU CAN'T SEE NOW
BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500
- I CAN'T SEE.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.233
- IT'S THE ULTIMATE
HASSLE-FREE SOLUTION

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.166
FOR CONTROLLING
LITTER ODORS.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.833
GINA, GINA.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:07.766
OKAY, CAREFUL.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.433
[harp glissandos]

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.800
AS YOU KNOW,
PORTIA AND I HAVE THREE CATS,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.300
CHARLIE, CHAIRMAN,
AND GEORGE,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.700
AND I HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THEM BEFORE,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.300
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT I'VE NEVER SHARED BEFORE.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
I CAME ACROSS
CHARLIE'S DIARY.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.100
I FOUND IT
BETWEEN TWO CUSHIONS,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.700
AND SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
SHARE IT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.366
RANDY, IF I CAN HAVE
SOME DIARY-READING MUSIC.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.033
[soft music playing]

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.566
HE'S UP THERE.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.333
"SEPTEMBER 29TH.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.600
"TOTAL WASTE OF A DAY.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.200
"I SPENT FOUR HOURS
CAREFULLY SNEAKING UP ON A RAT.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.766
"TURNS OUT
IT WAS AN AVOCADO.

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.100
P.S., NOTE TO SELF.
MY TAIL IS ATTACHED TO ME."

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.466
THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.433
THAT'S ALL I CAN SHARE
RIGHT NOW ANYWAY.

00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:57.933
NOW, FOR THE FINAL DAY
OF CAT WEEK,

00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.066
I HAVE TWO VIDEOS
TO SHOW YOU,

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.466
AND NOT ONLY
ARE CATS INVOLVED,

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.500
THEY ALSO ADDRESS SOME RUMORS
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING AROUND.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.966
A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN ASKING

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.866
IF PORTIA AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE A BABY.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.600
THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIG RUMOR
GOING AROUND,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300
AND HERE'S A REASON
WE'RE NOT.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.833
[laughter]

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.500
SEE, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.766
IT'S CUTE FOR US
TO LOOK AT,

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:25.233
BUT THAT'S YOUR TOILET PAPER
RIGHT THERE.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.733
THAT IS A CUTE BABY, THOUGH.

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.866
ALL RIGHT, AND HERE'S WHY
WE HAVE CATS INSTEAD.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.766
[laughter]

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
[applause]

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:43.066
THAT'S--PUTTING IT BACK.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.566
HAPPY CAT WEEK,
EVERYBODY.

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.100
ONLY 360 MORE DAYS
UNTIL THE NEXT ONE.
