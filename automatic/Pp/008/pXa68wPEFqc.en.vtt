00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.969
 in this Mediterranean environment of olive trees and 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.770
 of vines we found the strains more 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.690
 old tempranillo of more et del 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.369
 geop its fruit is used to elaborate 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 this plus set of 1777 in honor of the year of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 foundation of the winery to get it 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.970
 all processes in both the vineyard and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.520
 in the cellar they are exactly the same 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.520
 that were used more than 200 years ago 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.120
 and how it is expressed is of tempranillo and 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.240
 you know what he asks me he asks for a recipe 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.400
 that could be done in 1777 and there 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.230
 let's look at a bear I'm looking for veal 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.240
 like this that we are going to cook it in a 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.070
 casserole with the elements that go 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.410
 perfect to pair with the wine that 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.680
 they are juniper berries a bit of 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.230
 beets some dried mushrooms some tomatoes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.010
 dried and a little sage once 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.350
 we have all the ingredients 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.479
 raised the only thing that we need to do 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.640
 It is already applying a good caldo broth 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.190
 like this one that I have here you see he was 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.369
 over what to cover so you can 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.310
 take off little by little and finally a 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.290
 little trick I'm going to take a piece of 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 squid like this and I'm going to put it 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.360
 inside now when it boils I explain 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 why we will do 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.500
 and the best way to leave meat 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.360
 well tender is to serve it like this gently 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.340
 on the other hand I'm going to kill him 'all 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 acidity is thanks to the squid and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 beet and once the meat is tender 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.320
 what we are going to do is start 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.180
 adore it in a pan to take 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.180
 much more personality 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 well, we only need to skip this 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.450
 tomato you see cortadito so tiny 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.970
 together with the beans as garnish 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.850
 for our plate 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.400
 more or less how are you for a person 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.390
 no more true 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 and on the other hand 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.790
 fantastic and on the other hand check that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.849
 our flesh has really been good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 golden fixes 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.580
 that way it takes a lot of tone a lot 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.500
 much more powerful finally look ye a 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 little of the cooking broth just above 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.150
 of the flesh 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.450
 and let's reduce it a little bit to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.640
 that takes flavor of sauce 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.290
 very well, we already have it simply 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.870
 you need to finish putting the elements 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.120
 inside the dish the beans 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.360
 and now every time the calf 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.970
 stayed and bright tender with all the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.069
 sauce that brings us the conclusion of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.140
 all the elements that we have put in 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.610
 the dish for the pairing for this 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.750
 tempranillo 1777 others live from the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.750
 cellar to your table
