00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
safely claim this is the largest

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.540 
safely claim this is the largest
switchable<00:00:58.030> of<00:00:58.149> spaceship<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.199> world

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
switchable of spaceship in the world

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.000 
switchable of spaceship in the world
it's<00:01:00.550> six<00:01:00.760> foot<00:01:00.940> three<00:01:01.000> inches<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:02.010> spaceship

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
it's six foot three inches and spaceship

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.149 
it's six foot three inches and spaceship
two<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.190> big<00:01:03.339> don't<00:01:03.610> usually<00:01:04.050> swish<00:01:05.050> so<00:01:06.009> this

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
two this big don't usually swish so this

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
two this big don't usually swish so this
one<00:01:06.310> swishes<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.060> stays<00:01:07.360> together

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.830 

it<00:01:10.659> took<00:01:10.780> me<00:01:10.930> eight<00:01:11.110> months<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:12.840> know

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
it took me eight months you know

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.940 
it took me eight months you know
building<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.530> tearing<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.860> apart

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
building it and tearing it apart

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.830 
building it and tearing it apart
starting<00:01:15.399> again<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:15.729> rebuilding<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.750> all

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
starting again and rebuilding and all

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.240 
starting again and rebuilding and all
such<00:01:17.020> stuff<00:01:17.259> with<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> creation<00:01:17.830> of<00:01:18.100> this

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
such stuff with the creation of this

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.130 
such stuff with the creation of this
size<00:01:18.550> where<00:01:19.210> do<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.390> start<00:01:19.720> with<00:01:19.869> when<00:01:20.050> you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
size where do you start with when you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.630 
size where do you start with when you
first<00:01:20.320> think<00:01:20.560> about<00:01:20.830> starting<00:01:21.340> building

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
first think about starting building

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.490 
first think about starting building
something<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.119> size<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.810> if<00:01:23.259> make

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
something of this size is it if make

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.169 
something of this size is it if make
plants<00:01:23.950> draw<00:01:24.130> something<00:01:24.580> or<00:01:24.820> everything's

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
plants draw something or everything's

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.999 
plants draw something or everything's
out<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.300> my<00:01:25.420> head<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:26.110> build<00:01:26.320> as<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.830> go

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
out of my head I just build as I go

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.980 
out of my head I just build as I go
right<00:01:27.369> if<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.119> look<00:01:28.270> at<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.450> ship<00:01:28.630> you'll<00:01:28.810> see

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
right if you look at the ship you'll see

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.200 
right if you look at the ship you'll see
that<00:01:29.140> there's<00:01:29.380> actually<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.770> box<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.429> technique

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
that there's actually a box a technique

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850 
that there's actually a box a technique
that<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.929> can<00:01:32.050> look<00:01:32.200> at<00:01:32.289> it<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.649> it<00:01:32.710> goes

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
that you can look at it you see it goes

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.080 
that you can look at it you see it goes
right<00:01:33.070> from<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.280> back<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.729> front<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
right from the back the front to the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.540 
right from the back the front to the
back<00:01:34.179> that's<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.470> this<00:01:35.679> box<00:01:36.009> so<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.310> goes

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
back that's it this box so that goes

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.389 
back that's it this box so that goes
right<00:01:36.700> through<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:37.000> ship<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.420> then<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.929> add

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
right through the ship and then you add

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.580 
right through the ship and then you add
you<00:01:39.399> add<00:01:39.520> your<00:01:39.700> decks<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.330> got<00:01:40.659> five<00:01:41.170> decks<00:01:41.409> here

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
you add your decks I got five decks here

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.499 
you add your decks I got five decks here
so<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.310> same<00:01:42.520> box<00:01:42.729> like<00:01:42.880> lowered<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.300> deck

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
so the same box like lowered it a deck

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.620 
so the same box like lowered it a deck
for<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.929> hangers<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:45.060> raised<00:01:46.060> another<00:01:46.360> deck

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
for the hangers and raised another deck

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.230 
for the hangers and raised another deck
for<00:01:46.960> living<00:01:47.530> quarters<00:01:47.800> cabins<00:01:48.159> galley<00:01:49.030> all

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
for living quarters cabins galley all

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.979 
for living quarters cabins galley all
that<00:01:49.390> sort<00:01:49.539> of<00:01:49.569> stuff

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:49.989 
that sort of stuff

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.550 
that sort of stuff
captains<00:01:50.739> quarters<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.429> bridge<00:01:52.560> but

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
captains quarters and the bridge but

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.559 
captains quarters and the bridge but
basically<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.160> just<00:01:54.310> starts<00:01:54.550> with<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.849> that

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
basically it just starts with that that

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:56.820 
basically it just starts with that that
long<00:01:55.810> frame<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.349> you<00:01:56.410> can<00:01:56.500> take<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.709> from

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
long frame and you can take it from

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.650 
long frame and you can take it from
there<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.099> you<00:01:57.819> start<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.509> you

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
there and you start with that and you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.020 
there and you start with that and you
should<00:01:58.690> be<00:01:59.429> once<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.489> get<00:02:00.610> yourself<00:02:00.849> a<00:02:00.910> good

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
should be once you get yourself a good

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.880 
should be once you get yourself a good
solid<00:02:01.239> frame<00:02:01.479> happening<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:02.530> can<00:02:02.679> start

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
solid frame happening you can start

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.449 
solid frame happening you can start
skinning<00:02:03.129> it<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:04.989> swish<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.459> very

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
skinning it and you can swish it very

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.529 
skinning it and you can swish it very
freely<00:02:06.819> solid

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
freely solid

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.160 
freely solid

you showing that to us what what's it
take<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.760> get<00:02:13.030> accretion<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.989> brick

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
take to get accretion like this to brick

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.390 
take to get accretion like this to brick
world<00:02:14.379> how<00:02:14.530> does<00:02:14.680> your<00:02:14.800> train<00:02:14.980> support<00:02:15.280> this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
world how does your train support this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.360 
world how does your train support this
okay<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> comes<00:02:16.360> apart<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.370> it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
okay so it comes apart it's a it's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.130 
okay so it comes apart it's a it's
modular<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.390> three<00:02:19.599> sections<00:02:19.840> just

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
modular so it's in three sections just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380 
modular so it's in three sections just
make<00:02:20.379> this<00:02:20.590> main<00:02:20.800> section<00:02:20.980> here<00:02:21.370> travelled<00:02:22.330> in

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
make this main section here travelled in

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.770 
make this main section here travelled in
that<00:02:22.599> big<00:02:23.260> blue<00:02:23.410> tub<00:02:23.620> there<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.510> back

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
that big blue tub there this back

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
that big blue tub there this back
section<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.230> engines<00:02:26.500> come<00:02:26.620> off<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:27.160> back

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
section the engines come off the back

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.160 
section the engines come off the back
section<00:02:27.520> slides<00:02:27.970> off<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.450> front<00:02:28.870> section

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
section slides off the front section

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.780 
section slides off the front section
slides<00:02:29.379> off<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:30.040> thought<00:02:30.370> another<00:02:30.550> box

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
slides off and I thought another box

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.970 
slides off and I thought another box
under<00:02:31.000> here<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.239> they<00:02:31.330> traveling<00:02:31.980> breaks

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
under here that they traveling breaks

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.610 
under here that they traveling breaks
into<00:02:33.190> about<00:02:33.400> 15<00:02:33.700> sections<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.440> takes

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
into about 15 sections and it takes

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.130 
into about 15 sections and it takes
about<00:02:35.739> 45<00:02:36.280> minutes<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.580> put<00:02:36.760> together

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
about 45 minutes to put together

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
about 45 minutes to put together
but<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.920> designed<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.180> can<00:02:40.330> get<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
but I designed it so that I can get it

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.420 
but I designed it so that I can get it
out<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.960> room<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.200> built<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:42.340> I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
out of the room I built it in because I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.600 
out of the room I built it in because I
can't<00:02:42.690> it's<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:44.680> when<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.070> together<00:02:45.400> I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
can't it's like when it's together I

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.890 
can't it's like when it's together I
can't<00:02:45.910> get<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.360> room<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> have

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
can't get it out of the room so I have

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.020 
can't get it out of the room so I have
to<00:02:46.990> actually<00:02:47.140> pull<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.650> all<00:02:47.740> apart<00:02:47.770> if<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.850> want

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
to actually pull it all apart if I want

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.130 
to actually pull it all apart if I want
to<00:02:49.090> look<00:02:49.210> at<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.480> somewhere<00:02:49.840> else<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.080> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
to look at it in somewhere else in the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.660 
to look at it in somewhere else in the
room<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.710> know<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.520> have<00:02:51.610> a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
room just you know just to have a

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.670 
room just you know just to have a
different<00:02:52.000> perspective<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> thing<00:02:52.960> take

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
different perspective on the thing take

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.160 
different perspective on the thing take
it<00:02:53.770> apart<00:02:54.010> all<00:02:54.850> right<00:02:55.030> 45<00:02:55.540> minutes<00:02:55.900> taking<00:02:56.080> it

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
it apart all right 45 minutes taking it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.870 
it apart all right 45 minutes taking it
apart<00:02:56.380> move<00:02:56.890> all<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.100> pieces<00:02:57.130> into<00:02:57.580> wherever

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
apart move all the pieces into wherever

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.870 
apart move all the pieces into wherever
I'm<00:02:58.290> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.770> up<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.070> then<00:03:00.220> 45

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
I'm going to put it up and then 45

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.920 
I'm going to put it up and then 45
minutes<00:03:01.090> minute<00:03:01.270> putting<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.720> back<00:03:01.810> together

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
minutes minute putting it back together

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.790 
minutes minute putting it back together
and<00:03:02.350> stand<00:03:03.070> back<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.310> look<00:03:03.400> at<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.640> and
