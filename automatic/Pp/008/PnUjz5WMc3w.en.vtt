 tasks for the study of all the characters you have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.110
 It will take about 340 hours, that is, the game does not 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.170
 will seem monotonous boring 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.789
 we ask for the flaws of ordinary games second 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.039
 very important plus dota in the game 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.309
 throws at the enemy and deals big 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.160

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.019
 way I have all this reminds Nurse 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.450
 and between the points on the object of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 who saw her schoolboy son 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 cigarettes and berries 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 so she approaches China squeak and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.530
 just a bitch starts to cut it short 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.530
 later he fucking 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.220
 yes something like that 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.300
 still the most important plinth is a male and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 when a bunch of players Putin is the same 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.320

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.429
 another very interesting ability 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.450
 feels character dragon knight it 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.670
 the ability is called of the dragon 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 form a dragon knight takes shape 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.649
 some kind of white dragon who 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.600
 endures everyone and everything 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.939
 another huge plus of dota 2 is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.530
 really interesting subjects 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.390
 starting from ordinary mitts game which 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.859
 gives just a pixel ends 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.250
 ending with some 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.380
 ultra hearts any traxes well 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.780
 or just a pint of heart honestly not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.299
 I know that this is also in addition to ordinary things 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 here are presented and the thing that can 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.670
 cross it remained from 1 to 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:21.170
 naturally these things have much 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:24.319
 more good effect and usually immediately them 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.329
 collect all the teams also in dota 2 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.500
 company 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 because she promises the most important thing 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.540
 now we come to the minuses so 1 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.880
 minus 0 to can connect and command 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.319

 I got such a team of mamma shoes then 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.299

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.329

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.660
