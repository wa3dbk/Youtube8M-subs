of<00:04:12.590> course<00:04:12.829> we<00:04:12.980> have<00:04:13.129> the<00:04:13.280> bolts<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.670> are

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
of course we have the bolts that are

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.599 
of course we have the bolts that are
securing<00:04:14.299> our<00:04:14.480> pulley<00:04:15.190> now<00:04:16.190> remember<00:04:16.519> this

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
securing our pulley now remember this

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.390 
securing our pulley now remember this
will<00:04:16.789> rotate<00:04:16.940> forward<00:04:17.720> so<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.620> get<00:04:18.829> my<00:04:19.100> belt

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
will rotate forward so I can get my belt

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.650 
will rotate forward so I can get my belt
back<00:04:19.579> on<00:04:21.490> back<00:04:22.490> tight<00:04:22.789> now<00:04:23.150> we're<00:04:23.300> ready<00:04:23.479> to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
back on back tight now we're ready to

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.830 
back on back tight now we're ready to
move<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.139> controller<00:04:25.660> here's<00:04:26.660> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
move to the controller here's the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.089 
move to the controller here's the
controller<00:04:27.229> that's<00:04:27.440> going<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.740> come<00:04:27.949> with

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
controller that's going to come with

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.219 
controller that's going to come with
your<00:04:28.220> kit<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.360> mount<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:29.780> wherever<00:04:29.990> you

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
your kit you can mount this wherever you

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.870 
your kit you can mount this wherever you
want<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:30.770> we<00:04:30.889> suggest<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.610> do<00:04:31.759> it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
want but we suggest that you do it

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.450 
want but we suggest that you do it
within<00:04:32.180> 18<00:04:32.780> inches<00:04:33.229> of<00:04:33.289> your<00:04:33.590> radiator<00:04:33.889> Inlet

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
within 18 inches of your radiator Inlet

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.129 
within 18 inches of your radiator Inlet
because<00:04:35.000> this<00:04:35.180> probe<00:04:35.449> is<00:04:35.660> going<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.900> need<00:04:36.050> to

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
because this probe is going to need to

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.439 
because this probe is going to need to
mount<00:04:36.320> right<00:04:36.590> into<00:04:36.949> here<00:04:37.340> now<00:04:37.940> I'm<00:04:38.150> going<00:04:38.389> to

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
mount right into here now I'm going to

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.360 
mount right into here now I'm going to
choose<00:04:38.750> probably<00:04:39.380> about<00:04:39.470> right<00:04:39.650> here<00:04:40.039> for<00:04:40.250> my

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
choose probably about right here for my

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.550 
choose probably about right here for my
controller<00:04:40.820> but<00:04:41.750> let's<00:04:41.900> talk<00:04:42.139> about<00:04:42.199> the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
controller but let's talk about the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.710 
controller but let's talk about the
positive<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.160> negative<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.820> know<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.360> might<00:04:44.509> seem

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
positive a negative I know it might seem

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.420 
positive a negative I know it might seem
tempting<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.289> use<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.650> as<00:04:45.830> your<00:04:45.860> positive

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
tempting to use this as your positive

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.189 
tempting to use this as your positive
source<00:04:46.699> but<00:04:47.330> it's<00:04:47.449> important<00:04:47.900> you're<00:04:48.080> going

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199
