many balls do you think you end up
through<00:01:08.040> drilling<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.390> tournament

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
through drilling for this tournament

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.560 
through drilling for this tournament
definitely<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.970> definitely<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.420> world

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
definitely the definitely the the world

definitely the definitely the the world
series<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.229> something<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.369> drilled<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
series is something that we drilled the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300 
series is something that we drilled the
most<00:01:14.939> at<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.360> we'll<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> end<00:01:17.130> of
