and<00:02:29.569> when<00:02:30.049> you<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.799> pull<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.220> pull<00:02:32.120> that

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
and when you you pull this pull that

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.410 
and when you you pull this pull that
little<00:02:32.480> lever<00:02:32.780> pulls<00:02:33.290> puts<00:02:33.590> tension<00:02:33.859> on<00:02:34.160> it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
little lever pulls puts tension on it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:54.490 
little lever pulls puts tension on it
that's<00:02:35.420> how<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.630> get<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> drive

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:10.429 

this<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.650> hit<00:02:55.799> or<00:02:55.920> miss<00:02:55.950> right<00:03:09.230> we<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.409> a

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
this is hit or miss right we have a

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.259 
this is hit or miss right we have a
little<00:03:10.829> bit<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.069> trouble<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.609> we<00:03:12.120> don't

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
little bit of trouble with it we don't

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.940 
little bit of trouble with it we don't
know<00:03:12.329> if<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.599> starved<00:03:12.989> for<00:03:13.139> fuel<00:03:13.409> or<00:03:13.739> what

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
know if it's starved for fuel or what

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.770 
know if it's starved for fuel or what
why<00:03:14.700> they<00:03:14.849> should<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.090> running<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.450> little<00:03:15.540> bit

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
why they should be running a little bit

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.699 
why they should be running a little bit
faster<00:03:16.230> than<00:03:16.349> that<00:03:17.720> yeah<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> was<00:03:19.230> looking<00:03:19.440> at

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
faster than that yeah I was looking at

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.080 
faster than that yeah I was looking at
that<00:03:19.859> see<00:03:21.139> you<00:03:22.139> pull<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.530> lever<00:03:22.970> there's<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
that see you pull that lever there's a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.569 
that see you pull that lever there's a
tensioner<00:03:24.659> and<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.709> move<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:26.069> up<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
tensioner and you just move that up and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.089 
tensioner and you just move that up and
now<00:03:26.639> it's<00:03:27.180> engaged<00:03:28.909> it's<00:03:29.909> relatively<00:03:30.420> simple

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
now it's engaged it's relatively simple

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.920 
now it's engaged it's relatively simple
but<00:03:32.099> back<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.849> back<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.180> its<00:03:33.299> time<00:03:33.569> I'll<00:03:33.750> bet

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
but back it back in its time I'll bet

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.949 
but back it back in its time I'll bet
you<00:03:34.109> wasn't<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.500> cheap<00:03:34.739> mower<00:03:35.510> any<00:03:36.510> idea<00:03:36.840> what

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
you wasn't a cheap mower any idea what

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.140 
you wasn't a cheap mower any idea what
this<00:03:37.109> cost<00:03:37.409> back<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> day<00:03:40.790> yeah<00:03:41.790> we've<00:03:41.970> got

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
this cost back in the day yeah we've got

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.809 
this cost back in the day yeah we've got
all<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.420> documentation<00:03:43.019> for<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.530> oh<00:03:44.069> if<00:03:44.699> it's

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
all the documentation for it oh if it's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.569 
all the documentation for it oh if it's
original<00:03:45.359> but<00:03:45.599> it's<00:03:46.010> it's<00:03:47.010> still<00:03:47.280> everything

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
original but it's it's still everything

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.039 
original but it's it's still everything
everything's<00:03:48.150> all<00:03:48.329> there<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:48.810> can<00:03:48.930> look

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
everything's all there so we can look

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.990 
everything's all there so we can look
that<00:03:49.199> up<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.709> find<00:03:50.129> out<00:03:50.430> what<00:03:50.609> it<00:03:50.730> used<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
that up and find out what it used to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.589 
that up and find out what it used to
used<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.540> cost<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:04:00.120> we're<00:04:00.389> going<00:04:00.540> to

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
used to cost I think we're going to

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.149 
used to cost I think we're going to
change<00:04:00.840> them<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.680> mixture<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> little

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
change them just the mixture a little

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:14.509 
change them just the mixture a little
bit<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.019> little<00:04:13.079> needle<00:04:13.889> valve<00:04:14.099> there<00:04:14.340> we

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
bit just a little needle valve there we

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.750 
bit just a little needle valve there we
turn<00:04:14.729> and<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.389> just<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.139> mixture<00:04:16.699> say<00:04:17.699> are

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
turn and that a just the mixture say are

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.509 
turn and that a just the mixture say are
they<00:04:17.940> were<00:04:18.000> doing<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> little<00:04:18.479> better<00:04:18.690> now

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
they were doing a little better now

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.740 
they were doing a little better now
you'll<00:04:20.519> notice<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:20.940> air-cooled<00:04:21.449> there's<00:04:21.659> a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
you'll notice it's air-cooled there's a

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.620 
you'll notice it's air-cooled there's a
little<00:04:22.049> fan<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> side<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.159> was<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.510> was

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
little fan on the side that was that was

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.689 
little fan on the side that was that was
one<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.050> well<00:04:25.470> made<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> ideal<00:04:26.159> motors<00:04:26.550> to

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
one of the well made the ideal motors to

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.250 
one of the well made the ideal motors to
kind<00:04:26.909> of<00:04:26.940> separated<00:04:27.479> them<00:04:27.630> from<00:04:27.659> the<00:04:27.930> other<00:04:28.080> is

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
kind of separated them from the other is

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.189 
kind of separated them from the other is
most<00:04:28.530> one<00:04:28.740> world<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.690> water-cooled<00:04:30.690> dad<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.960> hot

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
most one world a water-cooled dad a hot

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.560 
most one world a water-cooled dad a hot
big<00:04:31.440> hopper<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:31.830> top<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.639> now<00:04:33.180> it's<00:04:33.360> cooling

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
big hopper on top and now it's cooling

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:43.980 
big hopper on top and now it's cooling
but<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.050> air-cooled

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.559 

my<00:04:44.979> personal<00:04:45.490> theory<00:04:45.850> is<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.360> big

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:46.569 
my personal theory is that the big

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.659 
my personal theory is that the big
roller<00:04:47.139> on<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.530> bottom<00:04:47.919> is<00:04:48.069> to<00:04:48.100> create<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
roller on the bottom is to create the

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.820 
roller on the bottom is to create the
illusion<00:04:48.789> that<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.930> doesn't<00:04:50.229> actually<00:04:50.380> cut

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
illusion that it doesn't actually cut

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.950 
illusion that it doesn't actually cut
the<00:04:50.949> grass<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.729> smashes<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.449> down<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.840> makes

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
the grass it smashes it down and makes

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.080 
the grass it smashes it down and makes
it<00:04:53.110> look<00:04:53.199> like<00:04:53.259> you<00:04:53.530> did<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.729> way<00:04:54.910> when

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
it look like you did so that way when

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.200 
it look like you did so that way when
mom<00:04:55.330> sees<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:55.750> she<00:04:56.620> thinks<00:04:56.919> oh<00:04:57.009> yeah<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:58.000> cut

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
mom sees you she thinks oh yeah and cut

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.189 
mom sees you she thinks oh yeah and cut
the<00:04:58.300> grass<00:04:58.479> Thanks<00:04:59.199> you<00:04:59.919> really<00:05:00.130> didn't<00:05:01.199> just

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
the grass Thanks you really didn't just

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:12.120 
the grass Thanks you really didn't just
my<00:05:02.349> theory<00:05:02.710> but<00:05:10.470> since<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.620> is<00:05:11.740> hit<00:05:11.979> or<00:05:12.099> miss

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
my theory but since it is hit or miss

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.129 
my theory but since it is hit or miss
you<00:05:12.310> can<00:05:12.639> see<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:13.560> cams<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.919> here<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:16.139> you

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
you can see the cams in here and you

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.330 
you can see the cams in here and you
can't<00:05:17.380> see<00:05:17.590> I'll<00:05:17.800> show<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.220> when

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
can't see I'll show it to you when

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.999 
can't see I'll show it to you when
South's<00:05:18.699> put<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.150> springs<00:05:19.539> in<00:05:19.750> here<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:20.410> when

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
South's put the springs in here and when

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.760 
South's put the springs in here and when
they<00:05:21.130> expand<00:05:21.639> from<00:05:22.599> centripetal<00:05:23.020> force<00:05:23.500> that

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
they expand from centripetal force that

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.189 
they expand from centripetal force that
keeps<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.130> from<00:05:24.160> firing<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:25.240> then<00:05:25.690> once<00:05:25.930> it

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
keeps it from firing and then once it

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.909
