00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
very difficult because the vast majority

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
very difficult because the vast majority
of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:30.060> struggle<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.450> using

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of the people really struggle with using

these<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:32.280> things<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> use<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.930> am<00:01:34.110> also

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
these just things to use and I am also

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
these just things to use and I am also
someone<00:01:34.860> who<00:01:34.890> generally<00:01:35.250> struggles<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:35.820> for
