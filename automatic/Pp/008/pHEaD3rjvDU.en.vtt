now our most efficient cruising speed is

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
now our most efficient cruising speed is
27<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> half<00:01:06.240> miles<00:01:06.540> per<00:01:06.840> hour

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
we got 2.9 miles per gallon now here's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
we got 2.9 miles per gallon now here's
what<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.160> like<00:01:11.550> about<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:12.090> jet<00:01:12.390> system

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what I really like about this jet system

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.560 
what I really like about this jet system
it's<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.950> boat<00:01:14.250> sticks<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's the way this boat sticks in the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.560 
it's the way this boat sticks in the
turns<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:16.530> jet<00:01:16.830> drives<00:01:17.159> dig<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.760> at<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.330> bug

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
turns these jet drives dig in at the bug

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.030 
turns these jet drives dig in at the bug
corners<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:20.460> nicely

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.210 

the<00:01:25.190> thrust<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.970> jet<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.390> linear

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
the thrust of the jet is linear

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.389 
the thrust of the jet is linear
have<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.520> worry<00:01:28.730> about<00:01:28.910> trim<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:29.840> makes

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.100 

now<00:01:33.399> at<00:01:33.579> low<00:01:33.759> speeds<00:01:34.149> there's<00:01:34.509> an<00:01:34.630> all<00:01:34.840> new

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
now at low speeds there's an all new

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.270 
now at low speeds there's an all new
feature<00:01:35.409> on<00:01:35.590> board

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
feature on board

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.670 
feature on board
and<00:01:37.090> its<00:01:37.210> adjustment<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.840> they<00:01:37.990> made<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.439> the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
and its adjustment that they made to the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.980 
and its adjustment that they made to the
buckets<00:01:39.159> on<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.579> jet<00:01:39.789> pumps<00:01:40.149> what<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.539> does<00:01:40.750> is

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
buckets on the jet pumps what it does is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.169 
buckets on the jet pumps what it does is
it<00:01:41.110> deflects<00:01:41.469> the<00:01:41.829> thrust<00:01:42.159> downward<00:01:42.820> when

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
it deflects the thrust downward when

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.990 
it deflects the thrust downward when
you're<00:01:43.329> below<00:01:43.539> 2,000<00:01:44.229> rpm<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.250> makes<00:01:45.490> your

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you're below 2,000 rpm and it makes your

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.480 
you're below 2,000 rpm and it makes your
idle<00:01:46.360> speed<00:01:46.659> very<00:01:47.140> easy<00:01:47.469> to<00:01:47.740> control<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.429> a

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
idle speed very easy to control and a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.039 
idle speed very easy to control and a
lot<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.759> Chet<00:01:48.939> folks<00:01:49.149> tend<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.479> wander<00:01:49.689> left

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
lot of Chet folks tend to wander left

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.840 
lot of Chet folks tend to wander left
and<00:01:50.229> right<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.920> one<00:01:51.130> holds<00:01:51.429> its<00:01:51.579> course

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
and right this one holds its course

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.880 
and right this one holds its course
really<00:01:52.090> well<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.929> minimum<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.530> steering

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
really well with a minimum of steering

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.270 
really well with a minimum of steering
input<00:01:54.539> now<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.600> SX<00:01:55.990> 240<00:01:56.560> has<00:01:56.740> lots<00:01:57.039> of<00:01:57.159> great

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
input now the SX 240 has lots of great

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.219 
input now the SX 240 has lots of great
performance<00:01:57.880> as<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.299> showed<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.509> let's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
performance as I just showed you let's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.200 
performance as I just showed you let's
take<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.469> walk<00:01:59.740> through<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.130> now<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:00.880> can<00:02:01.060> show

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
take a walk through it now so I can show

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.339 
take a walk through it now so I can show
you<00:02:01.299> some<00:02:01.509> of<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.659> luxury<00:02:02.020> features<00:02:02.380> built<00:02:02.890> in

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
you some of the luxury features built in

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.630 
you some of the luxury features built in
let's<00:02:05.349> start<00:02:05.649> out<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.130> bow<00:02:06.310> seating

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
let's start out with the bow seating

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.300 
let's start out with the bow seating
area<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.569> a<00:02:07.599> long<00:02:08.019> stretched<00:02:08.679> out<00:02:08.920> area

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
area this is a long stretched out area

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.759 
area this is a long stretched out area
where<00:02:09.489> actually<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> can<00:02:10.299> stretch<00:02:10.599> out<00:02:10.840> my<00:02:11.140> feet

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
where actually I can stretch out my feet

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.170 
where actually I can stretch out my feet
aren't<00:02:11.950> even<00:02:12.220> hitting<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.489> forward<00:02:12.849> bulkhead

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
aren't even hitting the forward bulkhead

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.900 
aren't even hitting the forward bulkhead
now<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> forward<00:02:14.470> seats<00:02:14.829> will<00:02:15.069> also<00:02:15.430> pop<00:02:15.670> out

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
now the forward seats will also pop out
