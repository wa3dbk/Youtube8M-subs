in and I would go to the best factories
I<00:00:39.260> mean<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.340> add<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> cost<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I mean it's it's you add up the cost of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
I mean it's it's you add up the cost of
the<00:00:42.899> factory<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.980> find<00:00:44.190> factories

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the factory and you can find factories

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.709 
the factory and you can find factories
make<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.690> any<00:00:45.930> price<00:00:46.410> level<00:00:46.980> except<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
lower the price level with factories the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
lower the price level with factories the
greater<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.170> volume<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
greater the volume of that you have to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.569 
greater the volume of that you have to
give<00:00:54.030> them<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.770> we<00:00:55.770> weren't<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> position

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
give them and we weren't in a position

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
give them and we weren't in a position
for<00:00:56.969> instance<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.809> expensive

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
for instance and our more expensive

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
for instance and our more expensive
clothes<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> give<00:00:58.890> big<00:00:59.129> volume<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.239> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
clothes to give big volume so it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
clothes to give big volume so it
automatically<00:01:01.050> puts<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> certain

whether you manufacture in Europe or
anywhere<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.909> cost<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.360> fabric<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
anywhere and then the cost of fabric and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
anywhere and then the cost of fabric and
it's<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> cost<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.939> labor<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.990> someone

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's the cost of labor of someone

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
it's the cost of labor of someone
selling<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.369> complicated<00:01:18.299> garments

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
selling it up very complicated garments

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.490 
selling it up very complicated garments
cost<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.430> sew<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.840> than<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:22.110> simple

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cost more to sew up than very simple

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.109 
cost more to sew up than very simple
ones<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.330> add<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.320> costs<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
ones so you add up all the costs and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
ones so you add up all the costs and
then<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.540> double<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.780> then<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.380> sell<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
then you double it and then you sell it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.480 
then you double it and then you sell it
to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> stores<00:01:33.140> for<00:01:34.140> double<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> cost<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
to the stores for double the cost and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.440 
to the stores for double the cost and
you<00:01:36.030> give<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.900> 8%<00:01:37.590> discount<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.549> then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you give them an 8% discount and then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.240 
you give them an 8% discount and then
the<00:01:39.630> store<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.200> doubled<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the store is doubled and you know so

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
the store is doubled and you know so
there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> lot<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.939> locking<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.649> the
