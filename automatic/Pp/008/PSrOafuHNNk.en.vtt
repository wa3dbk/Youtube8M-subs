whose slave labor Dan slave driver Dan
it's<00:01:46.290> making<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.590> still<00:01:46.799> work<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.840> got

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it's making them still work see we got

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's making them still work see we got
some<00:01:49.110> bracing<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.799> had<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> square<00:01:50.250> up

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
some bracing on here we had to square up

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.870 
some bracing on here we had to square up
the<00:01:50.520> screw<00:01:51.329> up<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> walls<00:01:52.340> as<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.549> putting

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the screw up the walls as you're putting

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.880 
the screw up the walls as you're putting
the<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> when<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.560> first<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the you know when you first do the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
the you know when you first do the
framing<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.640> um<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.240> pretty<00:01:57.299> shaky

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
framing it's pretty um it's pretty shaky

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.330 
framing it's pretty um it's pretty shaky
but<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> start<00:01:58.619> putting<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> plywood<00:01:59.280> on

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
but as you start putting the plywood on

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.060 
but as you start putting the plywood on
it<00:01:59.490> becomes<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.000> more<00:02:00.060> stable<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.070> once

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
it becomes more and more stable and once

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.230 
it becomes more and more stable and once
you<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> plywood<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> beach<00:02:03.000> it's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you put the plywood on the beach it's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
you put the plywood on the beach it's
it's<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> become<00:02:04.079> stable<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it's really going to become stable so

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
it's really going to become stable so
you<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:05.939> sure<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.210> square<00:02:06.329> before

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you want to make sure it's square before

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.369 
you want to make sure it's square before
you<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.869> any<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.140> work<00:02:09.080> see<00:02:10.080> he's<00:02:10.170> got<00:02:10.289> his

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
you do any of that work see he's got his

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.770 
you do any of that work see he's got his
little<00:02:10.470> production<00:02:10.890> center<00:02:11.670> set<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.750> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
little production center set up for a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.260 
little production center set up for a
cutting

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
cutting

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.940 
cutting
afters<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:14.230> makes<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.620> cut<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.890> he

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
afters it makes one cut and then then he

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.800 
afters it makes one cut and then then he
sets<00:02:18.160> up<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.400> solve<00:02:18.820> for<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> next<00:02:19.210> cut<00:02:19.390> goes

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
sets up the solve for the next cut goes

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.540 
sets up the solve for the next cut goes
through<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.200> does<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.490> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
through and does all of them so it's a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.520 
through and does all of them so it's a
real<00:02:21.700> efficient<00:02:22.330> way<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:23.320> all<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
real efficient way to get all the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.900 
real efficient way to get all the
rafters<00:02:23.830> done<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:27.340> right<00:02:27.430> well<00:02:27.490> that's<00:02:27.790> about

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
rafters done all right well that's about

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.180 
rafters done all right well that's about
it<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.150> today<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.480> think<00:02:28.960> tomorrow<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:30.070> going

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
it for today I think tomorrow it's going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.370 
it for today I think tomorrow it's going
to<00:02:30.250> look<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.580> real<00:02:30.820> house<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.300> keep<00:02:31.630> keep

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
to look like a real house I keep keep

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.510 
to look like a real house I keep keep
saying<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.710> every<00:02:32.860> time<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.370> looks

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
saying that every time I see it it looks

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.800 
saying that every time I see it it looks
a<00:02:33.580> little<00:02:33.760> bit<00:02:33.940> more<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.210> more<00:02:34.480> like<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> house

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
a little bit more and more like a house

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.950 
a little bit more and more like a house
but<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.260> think<00:02:35.710> once<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.010> roof<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.310> done<00:02:36.780> or<00:02:37.780> at

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
but I think once the roof is done or at

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.240 
but I think once the roof is done or at
least<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.230> sheathing<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:39.010> framed

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
least the sheathing and it's all framed

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.100 
least the sheathing and it's all framed
in<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> think<00:02:39.730> getting<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.690> view<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
in I think getting a view from the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.540 
in I think getting a view from the
inside<00:02:41.140> it'll<00:02:41.650> be<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.190> know<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.520> a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
inside it'll be you know you get a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.850 
inside it'll be you know you get a
better<00:02:42.700> feel<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.480> laid<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.050> late<00:02:44.740> on

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
better feel for it I laid in the late on

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.790 
better feel for it I laid in the late on
the<00:02:44.950> top<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.730> loft<00:02:46.480> today<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.440> get<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.620> feel

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
the top of the loft today to get a feel

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.350 
the top of the loft today to get a feel
for<00:02:47.980> Derby<00:02:48.220> like<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.460> sleep<00:02:48.610> up<00:02:48.730> there<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.060> I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
for Derby like to sleep up there and I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.880 
for Derby like to sleep up there and I
think<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> make<00:02:50.560> sure<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.770> was

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
think because I want to make sure it was

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.350 
think because I want to make sure it was
enough<00:02:51.070> room<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.460> was<00:02:51.580> little<00:02:51.970> concerned<00:02:52.300> about

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
enough room I was little concerned about

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.180 
enough room I was little concerned about
that<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.050> feel<00:02:53.500> pretty<00:02:53.620> good<00:02:53.770> about<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.010> I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
that but I feel pretty good about it I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.920 
that but I feel pretty good about it I
think<00:02:54.610> it's<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.120> think<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.450> plenty<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
think it's a I think it's plenty and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.210 
think it's a I think it's plenty and
plus<00:02:56.140> there's<00:02:56.350> plenty<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.620> overhead<00:02:57.010> when

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
plus there's plenty of overhead when

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.770 
plus there's plenty of overhead when
you're<00:02:57.340> standing<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.730> kitchen<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.690> know

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
you're standing in the kitchen you know

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.880 
you're standing in the kitchen you know
it's<00:02:58.870> always<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.080> compromise<00:02:59.350> when<00:02:59.740> you're

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
it's always a compromise when you're

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.020 
it's always a compromise when you're
when<00:03:00.190> you're<00:03:00.280> dealing<00:03:00.460> with<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> limited

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
when you're dealing with the limited

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.060 
when you're dealing with the limited
height<00:03:01.210> but<00:03:02.050> uh<00:03:02.110> I'll<00:03:02.590> see<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.800> guys<00:03:02.860> tomorrow
