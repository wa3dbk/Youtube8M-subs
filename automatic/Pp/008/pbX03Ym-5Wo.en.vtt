makes me very excited I think the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
makes me very excited I think the
positive<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.399> of<00:01:32.429> doing<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.850> talked

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
positive way of doing this have talked

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
positive way of doing this have talked
about<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> negative<00:01:33.630> stereotypes<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> maybe

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
about the negative stereotypes of maybe

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.690 
about the negative stereotypes of maybe
Jewish<00:01:34.619> people<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.399> out<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Jewish people that we can get out of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
Jewish people that we can get out of
this<00:01:35.789> I<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> positive<00:01:36.630> aspect<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this I think the positive aspect of it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.480 
this I think the positive aspect of it
is<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.579> um<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:40.259> when<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.860> people<00:01:41.220> ask

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is that um for me when I when people ask

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
is that um for me when I when people ask
me<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.030> Jewish<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.569> don't<00:01:42.630> abide<00:01:43.079> by

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
me if I'm Jewish and I don't abide by

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.020 
me if I'm Jewish and I don't abide by
all<00:01:43.470> means<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.340> keep<00:01:44.549> kosher<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> those

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
all means I don't keep kosher in those

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
all means I don't keep kosher in those
things<00:01:45.179> but<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.840> biggest<00:01:46.020> ideal

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
things but I think the biggest ideal

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
things but I think the biggest ideal
that<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.890> keep<00:01:47.159> sacred<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.360> family<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.959> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that we keep sacred to my family is the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
that we keep sacred to my family is the
idea<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.679> family<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> idea<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> staying

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
idea of family and the idea of staying

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480 
idea of family and the idea of staying
close<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.679> keeping<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.310> family

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
close and you know keeping your family

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.949 
close and you know keeping your family
very<00:01:53.789> close<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.209> caring<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:54.509> them<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.810> in

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
very close and caring about them and in

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.570 
very close and caring about them and in
the<00:01:55.049> end<00:01:55.080> whatever<00:01:55.860> happens<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.280> your<00:01:56.310> life

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the end whatever happens in your life

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.580 
the end whatever happens in your life
you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.849> always<00:01:56.970> go<00:01:57.209> back<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:58.170> messed

you can always go back to that as messed

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.190 
you can always go back to that as messed
up<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> family<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.819> its<00:02:00.179> outward<00:02:00.569> it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
up as the family as its outward it's

everything you know I think jack is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
everything you know I think jack is
probably<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> most<00:02:04.380> an<00:02:04.679> internal<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.759> one

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
probably the most an internal the one
