that<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.740> was<00:01:57.830> amazing<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.600> know<00:01:59.720> it's

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
that it was amazing and you know it's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.530 
that it was amazing and you know it's
Mario<00:02:00.830> what<00:02:01.100> he<00:02:01.220> expect<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.210> thought<00:02:02.330> that

Mario what he expect and I thought that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.719 
Mario what he expect and I thought that

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
would work well with this level so I

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.820 
would work well with this level so I
thought<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.209> won't<00:02:08.420> throw<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.780> put<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:08.989> on<00:02:09.110> I'm

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
thought I won't throw and put it on I'm

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.390 
thought I won't throw and put it on I'm
not<00:02:10.009> exactly<00:02:10.250> sure<00:02:10.459> what<00:02:10.729> Mario's<00:02:11.470> um<00:02:12.470> super

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400
