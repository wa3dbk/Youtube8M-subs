00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
regularly i'll show you have the games

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
regularly i'll show you have the games
game<00:01:27.869> works<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> sort<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
game works so you have like the sort of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
game works so you have like the sort of
like<00:01:29.820> pieces<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> circus<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.049> like

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
like pieces of a circus down here like

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
like pieces of a circus down here like
this<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.439> Artie<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.610> move<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this like Artie you can move the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.490 
this like Artie you can move the
trackball<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> left<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> changes

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
trackball I left to right and it changes

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
trackball I left to right and it changes
things<00:01:34.680> there's<00:01:35.340> also<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
things there's also like things like

things there's also like things like
this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> Sierra<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> lose<00:01:38.610> lives<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this is Sierra time I lose lives if you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.990 
this is Sierra time I lose lives if you
don't<00:01:39.299> put<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> circuit<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.729> screen

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
don't put a circuit out on the screen

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
don't put a circuit out on the screen
and<00:01:42.240> time<00:01:42.509> before<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> green<00:01:43.200> ones<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and time before the green ones out so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
and time before the green ones out so
then<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> next<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.259> add<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
then you see the next one you can add it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.039 
then you see the next one you can add it
here<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.479> then<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> move<00:01:48.930> them

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
here and then so you can move them

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.550 
here and then so you can move them
around<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:51.540> i'll<00:01:51.689> move<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> left

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
around like i'll move this to the left

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
around like i'll move this to the left
and<00:01:52.890> put<00:01:53.189> there<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.240> move<00:01:54.810> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and put there you can also like move it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.209 
and put there you can also like move it
with<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> screen<00:01:55.439> hitting<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> screen<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
with the screen hitting the screen to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.399 
with the screen hitting the screen to
you<00:01:56.399> feel<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> vibration<00:01:59.540> going<00:02:00.540> on

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
you feel the vibration going on

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.899

I<00:02:04.890> already<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:06.069> like<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.249> circuit<00:02:06.609> that's<00:02:06.759> not

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
I already have like a circuit that's not

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.479 
I already have like a circuit that's not
really<00:02:07.090> going<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.240> connect<00:02:07.600> unfortunately<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
really going to connect unfortunately so

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.640 
really going to connect unfortunately so
make<00:02:09.640> something<00:02:09.910> crazy<00:02:10.269> happen<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
make something crazy happen here this is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.400 
make something crazy happen here this is
going<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.860> be<00:02:14.980> fun

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:36.430 

I<00:02:21.700> might<00:02:22.700> make<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.970> work

what I gang goes and unfortunately now i

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.810 
what I gang goes and unfortunately now i
have<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> big<00:04:44.830> Messier<00:04:45.190> but<00:04:45.340> see<00:04:45.490> if<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.610> put

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
have a big Messier but see if you put

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.779 
have a big Messier but see if you put
that<00:04:46.539> down<00:04:46.600> there<00:04:46.810> now<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.229> can<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:48.639> can

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
that down there now you can you can

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.180 
that down there now you can you can
delete<00:04:49.000> like<00:04:49.180> any<00:04:49.360> one<00:04:49.539> piece<00:04:49.979> you'll<00:04:50.979> delete

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
delete like any one piece you'll delete

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.189 
delete like any one piece you'll delete
that<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.090> those<00:04:52.210> different<00:04:52.510> like<00:04:52.600> boxes<00:04:53.080> that

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
that so those different like boxes that

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.990 
that so those different like boxes that
you<00:04:53.229> get<00:04:54.039> one<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.370> them<00:04:54.460> deletes<00:04:54.820> everything

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
you get one of them deletes everything

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.340 
you get one of them deletes everything

you put on here and delete something any
circumscribe<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:04.000> course<00:05:04.180> thing<00:05:04.330> you're

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
circumscribe of course thing you're

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.790 
circumscribe of course thing you're
putting<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:04.810> random<00:05:05.139> pieces<00:05:05.350> where<00:05:05.680> those

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
putting like random pieces where those

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.250 
putting like random pieces where those
boxes<00:05:06.160> are<00:05:06.220> but<00:05:06.430> um<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.979> games<00:05:09.190> really<00:05:09.340> fun<00:05:10.260> so

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
boxes are but um the games really fun so

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.740 
boxes are but um the games really fun so
you<00:05:11.349> check<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.620> out<00:05:11.740> whoops<00:05:12.510> see<00:05:13.510> I<00:05:13.599> guess<00:05:13.750> died

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
you check it out whoops see I guess died

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.060 
you check it out whoops see I guess died
if<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:16.840> time<00:05:17.020> runs<00:05:17.199> out<00:05:17.289> three<00:05:17.530> times<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:17.949> you

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
if the time runs out three times and you

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.140 
if the time runs out three times and you
die

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.270 

and<00:05:24.690> sometimes<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.110> get<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.260> high<00:05:25.410> score<00:05:25.740> put

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
and sometimes you get a high score put

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:41.750 
and sometimes you get a high score put
your<00:05:26.400> name<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:29.210> I'll<00:05:30.210> see<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:30.480> there<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.780> go
