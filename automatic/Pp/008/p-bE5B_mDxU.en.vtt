00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.010
World of Tanks Blitz enters the next stage of development with update 2.0.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.350
The update finally adds clans—

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.230
large communities for socializing and playing together.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.500
Some changes to maps, balancing,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.320
and graphics were also introduced.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.550
The clan system allows players to join groups of up to 50 players.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.630
All members of a clan are able to easily find each other,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.800
join battles together, and share common statistics.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.090
A lot of new opportunities will be appearing in the future.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.220
However, we aren’t in a hurry:

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.960
the first version of this system will focus on creation and management.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.390
It is very easy to create or find a clan.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.020
The menu has a new tab.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.040
To join a clan that has already been created, just select it from a list.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.770
You can see the motto, description, percentage of victories,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.410
number of battles, vehicle tiers, and more.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.350
Submit a request and wait for the clan commander to approve it.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.610
Or you can do everything yourself.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.310
In the same menu, choose a name, unique tag,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010
description, and motto then gather players under your banner.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.780
Creating a clan enables you to make decisions about its members:

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.430
accept or reject requests for joining the clan and assign ranks to clan members.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.930
As soon as you become a clan member,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.080
a unique tag appears next to your name.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.850
Glorify it in battle.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.650
Start learning the new system.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.830
Step by step, it will reveal a new layer of gameplay with great possibilities.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.980
The most cohesive and coordinated clans will reap the rewards.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.420
Thanks to feedback from our players, we improved two maps.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.960
The biggest changes were applied to Oasis Palms.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.880
The location was almost redesigned from scratch.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.650
The terrain is now more even.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.550
We removed the mountains on the edges,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.470
now you can fire at anywhere on the map.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.940
The riverbed has been drained.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.780
And the urban area has become a large and strategically important zone.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.640
Teams’ respawn points are now closer to the directions

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.760
that you are likely to head in.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.330
For medium tanks, there are wide dunes

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.810
providing enough space for accelerating and maneuvering.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.280
Heavy tanks respawn in the urban area with plenty of shelter.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290
The Rockfield map has only begun to change.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.820
In this update, its landscape became more even with fewer bushes and trees.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.460
This will add a dynamic nature to the battles

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.220
as players will no longer have to fight against bushes.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.830
The changes in balance

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 mainly affected dispersion during the tank’s movement and the turret’s traverse.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.980
It was reduced for the Panther/M10, Pz.Kpfw. IV Hydrostat.,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.040
T-25, M4A3E2 Sherman, Fury, Ram II, and Valentine II.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.810
The settings menu has been thoroughly revised.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.530
New options allow you to set the graphics

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.720
in accordance with the performance of your device.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.980
Join the game, familiarize yourself with the new features,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.890
and start developing your clan.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.370
See you on the battlefield!
