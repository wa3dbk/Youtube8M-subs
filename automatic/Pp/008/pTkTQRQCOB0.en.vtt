fact of this merge unit here this

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.869 
fact of this merge unit here this
particular<00:00:35.289> piece<00:00:35.860> takes<00:00:36.280> out<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.610> two

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
particular piece takes out of the two

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.000 
particular piece takes out of the two
components<00:00:37.600> from<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:38.020> downpipes<00:00:38.739> and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
components from the downpipes and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.880 
components from the downpipes and
converts<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.399> into<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.789> three<00:00:40.030> inch<00:00:40.180> mid<00:00:40.570> pipe

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
converts it into the three inch mid pipe

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.799 
converts it into the three inch mid pipe
so<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:41.920> merges<00:00:42.250> in<00:00:42.550> here<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.030> gases<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.660> gas

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
so it merges in here the gases the gas

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.510 
so it merges in here the gases the gas
is<00:00:44.020> tumbling<00:00:44.260> here<00:00:44.649> than<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:44.890> guides<00:00:45.129> it<00:00:45.309> into

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
is tumbling here than it guides it into

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.819 
is tumbling here than it guides it into
a<00:00:45.550> nice<00:00:45.820> velocity<00:00:46.449> range<00:00:46.660> another<00:00:47.379> really
