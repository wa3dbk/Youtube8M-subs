 hi everyone with you channel facts and today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.259
 we will have a lesson so non-standard 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:19.279
 I will explain how to change the battery in blocks 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.939
 CPU what we need that is 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.060
 battery itself 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:31.009
 she looks like a screwdriver first 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 need to unscrew two screws 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.180
 I only have to open the lid 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 one screw here it is the second somewhere I 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.920
 lost everything after unscrewed 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:56.789
 the cover here is what we will have on go 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:00.390
 here this here it is our battery it can 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.250
 to be in different places and maybe 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.180
 turned to face you how to shoot in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.930
 I personally have to be taken back and that is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 down and pull some have 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.530
 springs every motor push or 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.600
 tweezers side pin down 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:26.150
 2 pieces of iron and the battery will fall out so 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.540
 take out the battery 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:34.890
 here is our old battery and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.990
 we will unpack but here and we insert it further 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.100
 just insert the battery to she was 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.060
 only already new 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.860
 and everything as if I will not show like 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.790
 salt because it will be uncomfortable for me 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.540
 keep the camera explain why change 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.000
 batteries 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.060
 for example if you turn on the computer it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.630
 in general, and only will and does not hand over others 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.619
 action or when an error in bios which 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.619
