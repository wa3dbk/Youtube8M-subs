looks like this yeah three and four we
around<00:01:31.610> seven<00:01:32.509> a<00:01:32.539> step<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.289> what<00:01:33.979> we<00:01:34.100> were

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
around seven a step and what we were

around seven a step and what we were
talking<00:01:34.670> about<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.149> that<00:01:35.329> we<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:35.570> get<00:01:35.750> our

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
talking about so that we can get our

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.230 
talking about so that we can get our
follows<00:01:36.229> back<00:01:36.619> on<00:01:36.890> three<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.310> four<00:01:37.609> is<00:01:37.789> we

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
follows back on three and four is we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.569 
follows back on three and four is we
actually<00:01:38.450> wanted<00:01:39.140> our<00:01:39.259> buys<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:39.649> be<00:01:39.770> offset<00:01:40.340> if

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
actually wanted our buys to be offset if

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.349 
actually wanted our buys to be offset if
we<00:01:41.149> did<00:01:41.329> just<00:01:41.359> up<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.049> four<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.619> had<00:01:42.799> Rock<00:01:43.670> step

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
we did just up to four we had Rock step

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.380 
we did just up to four we had Rock step
and<00:01:44.509> turn<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.409> turn<00:01:45.439> as<00:01:46.100> we<00:01:46.369> pass<00:01:46.609> by<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
and turn and turn as we pass by so the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.330 
and turn and turn as we pass by so the
whole<00:01:47.539> idea<00:01:47.899> is<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.079> make<00:01:48.409> sure<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:49.130> keep

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
whole idea is to make sure that you keep

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.580 
whole idea is to make sure that you keep
your<00:01:49.399> shoulders<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.479> your<00:01:50.659> hips<00:01:50.840> facing<00:01:51.229> each

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
your shoulders and your hips facing each

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.580 
your shoulders and your hips facing each
other<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.939> when<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.630> when<00:01:54.229> your<00:01:54.380> leader

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
other and when you when your leader

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.899 
other and when you when your leader
rotates<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.159> want<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.429> rotate<00:01:55.579> at<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.820> same

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
rotates you want to rotate at the same

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.840 
rotates you want to rotate at the same
time<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.229> even<00:01:57.590> though<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:57.740> do<00:01:57.920> feel<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.579> lead

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
time so even though I do feel a lead

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.819 
time so even though I do feel a lead
when<00:01:59.210> we're<00:01:59.420> actually<00:01:59.659> connected<00:02:00.439> it's<00:02:00.619> also

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
when we're actually connected it's also

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.950 
when we're actually connected it's also
a<00:02:01.009> little<00:02:01.280> bit<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.670> visual<00:02:01.850> cue<00:02:02.179> as<00:02:02.329> well<00:02:02.600> so

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
a little bit of a visual cue as well so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.870 
a little bit of a visual cue as well so
when<00:02:03.859> we<00:02:03.979> actually<00:02:04.189> do<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.609> whole<00:02:04.700> thing

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
when we actually do the whole thing

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.959 
when we actually do the whole thing
together<00:02:05.030> too<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.229> turn<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.920> turn<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.549> keep

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
together too we turn and turn and keep

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.860 
together too we turn and turn and keep
it<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.899> triple<00:02:09.560> step<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.690> think

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it going and triple step and I think

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.290 
it going and triple step and I think
