Oh so VSAT i reset it and know what am i

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.320 
Oh so VSAT i reset it and know what am i
doing<00:00:07.280> this<00:00:07.850> part<00:00:09.850> then<00:00:10.850> you<00:00:10.910> have<00:00:11.030> to<00:00:11.150> watch

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
doing this part then you have to watch

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.089 
doing this part then you have to watch
the<00:00:11.540> clock<00:00:11.720> and<00:00:11.780> count<00:00:12.230> your<00:00:12.769> respiratory

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
the clock and count your respiratory

00:00:13.099 --> 00:01:11.660 
the clock and count your respiratory
rate<00:00:13.460> as<00:00:13.670> well<00:00:13.880> right

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:22.630 

okay<00:01:13.580> okay<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.940> was<00:01:15.030> twenty<00:01:15.330> eight<00:01:15.360> breaths

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:37.539 

and<00:01:27.920> set<00:01:28.920> point<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:30.180> six

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:46.569 

one<00:01:38.450> sex<00:01:38.869> yes<00:01:44.109> so<00:01:45.109> that's<00:01:45.289> your<00:01:45.500> minute<00:01:46.310> that's

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
one sex yes so that's your minute that's

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.249 
one sex yes so that's your minute that's
the<00:01:46.729> minute<00:01:47.090> ventilation<00:01:47.119> times<00:01:48.049> your

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
the minute ventilation times your

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.959 
the minute ventilation times your
respiratory<00:01:48.829> rate<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.340> get<00:01:49.490> your<00:01:49.640> tidal

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
respiratory rate to get your tidal

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.209 
respiratory rate to get your tidal
volume<00:01:50.360> divided<00:01:51.310> divided<00:01:52.310> if<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.609> do<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.030> one

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
volume divided divided if I do this one

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.090 
volume divided divided if I do this one
divided<00:01:55.219> by<00:01:55.250> your<00:01:55.579> lavatory<00:01:55.959> right<00:01:56.959> okay<00:01:57.350> so

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
divided by your lavatory right okay so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.399 
divided by your lavatory right okay so
that<00:01:58.250> would<00:01:58.340> give<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.579> what<00:01:58.729> volume<00:02:02.409> somebody

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
that would give you what volume somebody

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.520 
that would give you what volume somebody
do<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.679> on<00:02:03.740> their<00:02:03.829> calculator<00:02:05.110> I'll<00:02:06.110> stop<00:02:06.350> my

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
do it on their calculator I'll stop my

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.890 
do it on their calculator I'll stop my
video<00:02:06.799> I<00:02:09.429> always<00:02:10.429> do<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.299> it's

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
video I always do that because I it's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.210 
video I always do that because I it's
the<00:02:11.959> opposite<00:02:12.410> of<00:02:12.530> what<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.769> normally<00:02:12.950> just

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the opposite of what you normally just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.530 
the opposite of what you normally just
aminute<00:02:13.849> vine<00:02:14.090> /<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.260> what<00:02:15.799> is<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.390> okay

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
aminute vine / I what is it okay

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.920 
aminute vine / I what is it okay
it<00:02:17.630> was<00:02:18.280> northern<00:02:20.019> 7.16<00:02:21.700> /<00:02:22.700> my<00:02:23.599> respiratory

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
it was northern 7.16 / my respiratory

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.190 
it was northern 7.16 / my respiratory
rate<00:02:24.230> which<00:02:24.380> was<00:02:24.560> 26<00:02:25.810> 28<00:02:26.810> 26<00:02:29.739> 26<00:02:30.849> 1.97

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
rate which was 26 28 26 26 1.97

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.970 
rate which was 26 28 26 26 1.97
so<00:02:33.200> which<00:02:33.410> would<00:02:33.560> be<00:02:38.349> right<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.530> said<00:02:39.680> seven

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so which would be right you said seven

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.840 
so which would be right you said seven
point<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.250> six<00:02:40.700> divided<00:02:41.540> by<00:02:41.920> 26<00:02:42.920> mm-hmm<00:02:43.760> oh

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
point one six divided by 26 mm-hmm oh

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.150 
point one six divided by 26 mm-hmm oh
wait<00:02:44.120> that's<00:02:44.299> even<00:02:44.569> wrong<00:02:44.750> wait<00:02:44.959> seven<00:02:45.440> point

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
wait that's even wrong wait seven point

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
wait that's even wrong wait seven point
one<00:02:46.280> six<00:02:46.819> divided<00:02:47.420> by<00:02:47.829> 26<00:02:48.829> is<00:02:49.489> zero<00:02:49.760> point<00:02:49.970> two

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
one six divided by 26 is zero point two

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.009 
one six divided by 26 is zero point two
seven<00:02:50.420> two<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:53.299> didn't<00:02:53.569> do<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
seven two so we didn't do it the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.709 
seven two so we didn't do it the
opposite<00:02:54.440> way<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:56.510> seven<00:02:56.989> nice
