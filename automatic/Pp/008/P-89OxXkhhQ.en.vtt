00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.139 
there and neatest of all is he has an
alternate<00:01:50.240> head<00:01:50.509> from<00:01:51.200> how<00:01:51.380> he<00:01:51.439> looked<00:01:51.829> when

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
alternate head from how he looked when

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.330 
alternate head from how he looked when
he<00:01:53.149> was<00:01:53.689> getting<00:01:53.810> interrogated<00:01:54.439> by<00:01:54.560> miral<00:01:55.130> but

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
he was getting interrogated by miral but

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.730 
he was getting interrogated by miral but
the<00:01:55.460> beat<00:01:55.640> up<00:01:55.820> face<00:01:56.149> head<00:01:56.420> sculpt<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.469> I<00:01:57.500> think

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
the beat up face head sculpt so I think

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.730 
the beat up face head sculpt so I think
that's<00:01:58.009> really<00:01:58.310> cool<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:59.390> not<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.840> basic

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
that's really cool it's not the basic

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.399 
that's really cool it's not the basic
Glen<00:02:01.100> look<00:02:01.340> from<00:02:01.700> series<00:02:02.240> season<00:02:03.049> one<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.229> the

Glen look from series season one of the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.499 
Glen look from series season one of the
TV<00:02:03.740> show<00:02:03.770> but<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.610> think<00:02:04.880> fans<00:02:05.119> are<00:02:05.270> going<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.420> be
