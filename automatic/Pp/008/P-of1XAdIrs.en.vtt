that<00:02:49.569> doesn't<00:02:49.900> sound<00:02:49.989> important<00:02:50.410> till<00:02:50.530> we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that doesn't sound important till we

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.410 
that doesn't sound important till we
upgrade<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.010> engine<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.910> sounds<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> bit

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
upgrade the engine that sounds a bit

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.270 
upgrade the engine that sounds a bit
important<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.230> guess<00:02:53.530> should<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:53.950> get<00:02:54.069> some

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
important I guess should we get some

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.340 
important I guess should we get some
wheels<00:02:54.700> can't<00:02:55.180> do<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> too<00:02:55.600> expensive<00:02:55.930> should

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
wheels can't do it too expensive should

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.960 
wheels can't do it too expensive should
we<00:02:56.440> get<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.590> zombie<00:02:57.100> kit<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.610> would<00:02:57.790> make

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
we get a zombie kit that would make

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.350 
we get a zombie kit that would make
sense

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
sense

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.449 
sense
I<00:02:58.450> guess<00:02:58.690> alright<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.500> are<00:02:59.530> gonna<00:02:59.680> get<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
I guess alright we are gonna get to the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.400 
I guess alright we are gonna get to the
pro<00:03:00.670> levels<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.569> last<00:03:01.780> thing<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.049> do<00:03:02.110> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
pro levels it's the last thing I do it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.870 
pro levels it's the last thing I do it
might<00:03:02.560> be<00:03:02.739> because<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:02.950> might<00:03:03.190> have<00:03:03.310> earned<00:03:03.549> my

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
might be because I might have earned my

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880 
might be because I might have earned my
