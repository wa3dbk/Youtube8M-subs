00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.950
 Hi guys, I'm good 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.200
 Today's makeup combines blue 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.809
 marine and tense when smoked 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.660
 Eggplant is a makeup I've ever done on 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.399
 blog was very successful so I 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.660
 I brought her on youtube now to whom 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.379
 can not learn a step-by-step 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.710
 photo I'll learn what I do then come 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.660
 with me start that trick back 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.480
 that old trick that I love about 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.179
 pass her kiss below the eyebrow 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.260
 I pass pencils and then I stop with the 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.940
 brush 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.579
 if you do not have an irene brush you can 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.469
 to fail with a finger alright, alright 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.469
 in simple there is no secret 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.440
 now I have a dark blue shadow 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.430
 apply throughout the eyelid 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.350
 mobile 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.890
 I applied on top of trailer, okay? 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:22.450
 I used it from america and I here with mild 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.450
 Shadow tapping on the cry and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.140
 I'll go upstairs, I'll go 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.940
 thus slightly blurring the movement in 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.070
 I 'll brush and I'll write it off. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.510
 so the leftovers for her to stay were 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.930
 marked 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.280
 I think you can see in this picture or 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.080
 always only to facilitate the sequence 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.950
 now by eggplant shadow with the brush 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.229
 small and stays with you if you have found both 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.540
 in the external channel as in when 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.720
 put the hole enough product to 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.060
 Makeup looks strange at the moment 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.659
 but it's just the same little better score is 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.509
 best 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.509
 the amount is too much 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:23.849
 now ask Celfin and you smoke and 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.739
 same shadow a little bit like me 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.019
 I applied beige pencils down there 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.970
 eyebrow when it came and 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.650
 want to meet with old will stay 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.780
 clearer gradient forming 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.599
 that's why I really like to use this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.879
 below the eyebrow 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.090
 So I 'm sending them to see I think. 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.970
 that the time state in the outer corner 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.430
 likes to make a little ball and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.180
 in the concave I make will see and blend 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.180
 with ball 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.540
 when I want to leave the shadow more 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.319
 dark or press the brush against the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.910
 eyelid 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.049
 when I want it to be clearer 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.849
 I take the pressure that I also took 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.310
 the pressure spoke of the new network is taught 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.920
 just to see where to eat fondue 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
 trade and the red inhabit the region 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.230
 I also do outside corner I love 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.340
 do because the shadow goes away you 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.340
 do not know she's done 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.290
 after this bad roriz I get an astra 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.150
 black and I apply it in the water line in front 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.260
 children is a good of light 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.260
 in our already dinha 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:15.959
 now I come back to the shade of ice and 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.959
 explored the mayor with her not easy 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.940
 now only brazil the athletic so 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.220
 now takes an opaque black shadow with 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.560
 small smoking brush and I 'll apply 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.000
 these works forming between wine and 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.280
 between the blue in the outer corner and in the body 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.290
 I also dense it a little bit close 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.510
 to the lower eyelashes only did not have it 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.160

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.960

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.580
 improve the law applies in exchange 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.240
 internal invading us the region 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.550
 Interior smell and eyelid O will 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.169
 invade the wind fountain car all round 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.080
 detail of Machiavelli in the field of 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.310
 makeup takes the corrective brush firm 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.100

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.020
 the limit that shadow not okay to spend 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.740
 the end of the eye with the eyebrow 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.000
 this is your limit and ends with a 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.410
 false eyelashes and trainer just to sing 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.340
 so the amount of the shot at the root of the 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.370
 eyelashes 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.200
