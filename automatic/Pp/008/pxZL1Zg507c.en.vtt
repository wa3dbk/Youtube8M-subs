 so I show you little what it gives 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.910
 in weak for this second north of the not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:45.180
 very powerful so that gives that I am 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.550
 tired cute so that gives you that I 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.020
 will show you go see it's going to be 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 exactly the same but with a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.109
 best quality graphics then for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.420
 do that then I say to myself 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.989
 well in your options options 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.689
 graphics are waiting to go our 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.790
 advanced settings 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.140
 be careful you have to do it yourself 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.900
 go to sleep nothing of the sun 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.070
 improvement the color she was from 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.259
 many years m - no I have you louis 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 means then after that is I'm going to them 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.220
 put under politics 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.979
 so we love these mercenaries the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.799
 vehicle you like yes level of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.939
 visit lights the wingers and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.009
 austria had not before that we want to 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.990
 put pedestrians then it's a one that a 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.189
 on earth I will not be raising ourselves from 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 her husband and so that's about what that has 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.619
 given 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.040
 so I was able to replicate then that 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.040
 applies 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 so that's it so only 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.190
 I had to make a small break without it 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.869
 was not going for you so I 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.400
 show what that gives then that's what 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.300
 that will give when you go play 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.300
 so I over five years not so much 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.010
 we see that I do not have too much to take 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.010
 to say that I smoke I do even so that's it 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:33.290
 so the film at the same time normal that I 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.600
 was turning I say 12 fps under film and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.940
 here you can look good men 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.830
 on the lighthouse more right to give 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.980
 and that's okay look at the rays of the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.980
 Sun 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.190

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.080

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.549

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:11.350
 here I wanted to say 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.900

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.950

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:58.680
