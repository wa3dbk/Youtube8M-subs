00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.439
 Hello, how are you? I am the dermatologist of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.750
 lima but throughout the website of 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.540
 peru.com we will perform in this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.800
 opportunity our ultra treatment 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 laser skin that is a very soft dye 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 made based on our system of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.000
 laser where we're going to renew the first 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.400
 layer of the skin of those indicated 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.180
 this treatment in people who 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 want to do only something very soft to 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.190
 sometimes we use creams in order to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 improve our skin that s &amp; p of our 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 skin we have to delay many 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.800
 days sometimes 15 days a month to be able 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 see an exhibition on the skin without 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.660
 However with this method the next day 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.890
 or every day we will be able to obtain 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.290
 that longed for a change of this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.700
 first layer of the skin the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.790
 procedure as we will do in 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.140
 a new moment 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.070
 you see a very white side of the skin 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.230
 soft 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.120
 I want to let you know some important 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.820
 If you want to do something very 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.890
 strong actually more brown conformant 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.080
 you see the mask that is formed 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.050
 through a laser or useful procedure 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.030
 and the stronger and more life case go 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 to need in this case is not going to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.570
 need rest city the most 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.300
 probable is that the next day or the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.410
 two days we can go quietly to 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 to work not work study 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.550
 This treatment is indicated in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 People who have pinkish growth 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.330
 of the skin 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.340
 except paste coordination or exam with the 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.650
 dermatologist and also patients who 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 have someone that we are going to perform the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.840
 procedure so that you can 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 see what is extremely 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.789
 fast and that we can analyze it in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.979
 any skin type patients because 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.569
 plant patients with teeth and they 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.810
 let's see what we are 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.600
 checking is basically a painted 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 the skin as painting the skin we can 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.969
 see the light that is happening very 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.619
 quickly on the skin and there is that light 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.190
 finally it is producing a heat 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.230
 is sending laser on the skin a 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.260
 heat that will eventually eventually produce 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.880
 a slight exposure of the skin we do 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 a few passes on the whole face 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.870
 so you can see this famous and this 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.870
 coveted 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.830
 on the side of the skin and do not forget that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 the peeling of the skin is always 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.390
 related to rejuvenation of the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.450
 skin to a greater or lesser degree in this case 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.370
 It is a very soft peeling I do not recommend 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 this treatment also for patients 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.380
 who need to do treatment for 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.970
 very dark spots nor is it neither 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.590
 neither for the people who want 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.780
 have an effect on what is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.870
 healing what the patient is going to 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.030
 feel is a slight heat on the skin and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.490
 that finally 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.430
 will finish sticking in 12 on 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.799
 God 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.290
 after this we are going to make a 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.230
 application of a hydrated mask 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.209
 on the skin of the person and practically 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.659
 is going home we do not move 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.819
 A lot does not need cream anesthesia 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.060
 the patient needs local anesthesia 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.090
 comes and immediately the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.620
 procedure I am the author attack
