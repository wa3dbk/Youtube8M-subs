00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.439
 hello everyone I'm the burden of my life 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.160
 anaconda this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:09.720
 scan the dragon map because 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 because we have to scan the map to 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.960
 times because for example if we want 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.070
 look for the resources or not have to be 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.690
 on the map and start looking click 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.779
 to see if he is a friendly enemy if there is 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.180
 choose to spy with that is not much more 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.650
 easy to enter the map tab of 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.600
 our 2 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.999
 you know that you can find it in my 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 blog and I'm updating it when 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:41.829
 one goes better than another 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.230
 good , our coordinates come out good 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.320
 maximum search radius are the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.390
 squares that there are from two cities one 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.890
 two three four or five I put seven 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.289
 so that they do not take long we can search 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.179
 alliances or what kind of alliance by 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.760
 example because you already have to do before 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.070
 you have all the players nearby or 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.469
 players or some exact player if 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 you want to look for the advanced boats of 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.420
 all ways we are like this you outpost 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.060
 start scanning I've put seven 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.490
 so that afternoon poquillo moment 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.399
 can you enjoy the music or good 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.869
 whatever, you can spend a little more 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.170
 forward the video I can not I have 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.170
 what to expect 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.640
 once you finish scanning this 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.160
 Who says good is the player 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 alliance coordinates and gives us here the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.270
 option to spy for example to see what 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.580
 you better see this a little bit fuzzy 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.860
 because I'm not very interested in people 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.960
 see all my crowns what I have what 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.270
 it ceases to have I do not care that you see 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.510
 my name and my power but I do not feel like it 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 of receiving many good spies gives us the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.350
 spy option spies and sends 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 directly our dear to a spy 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.240
 to that city to see what should be left to 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 watch 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.310
 Well, of course, I hope it stays 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.120
 clear questions everything as always 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.210
 or below the video or in the mail or in the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.250
 blog in the doubts section 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.530
 and I'm always looking at everything so I do not 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.420
 It took no more than 24 hours to answer 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 a greeting and that goes well
