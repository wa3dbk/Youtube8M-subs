00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.649
 and 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.600
 to good everyone made welcome to 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.299
 my channel I was going to present the best 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.910
 goalkeepers of the barclays premier league 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.970
 as you know the English league we are going to 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.679
 go from better to worse in my point of view 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.300
 if you want to say good in 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.640
 the comments who is better who is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.250
 but for you it seems very good in 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.260
 your opinion I'll give it my 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 we go with the first one that for me is 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.369
 peter check since I have it and it seems to me 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.059
 a good goalie better goalie than the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.120
 boat without any doubt 85 of stretched to 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.030
 85 of reflections 82 of stop 83 of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.059
 position is a very balanced goalkeeper 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.160
 very good in everything and its price can 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 cost around nine thousand or 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.280
 ten thousand coins 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.850
 we go with the next one that is for me 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.850
 hugo llorÃ­s 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.960
 with 86 destined to 89 of reflections 80 of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.770
 81 position stops 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.329
 It is also very good but I would prefer 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.239
 pretty h 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.560
 since you cry me in my second in my 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.790
 second goalkeeper because I do not like 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.950
 his way of being 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.350
 but I recognize that it is very good and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.490
 that has put him in second position 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.409
 It can cost around six thousand 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.649
 coins 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.009
 the next for me is heart this follows 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.719
 in my second goalkeeper by price issue 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.909
 since it costs three times less than 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.370
 tears 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.950
 and I like it a little more because of what 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.470
 you are not being more so that's why you could 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.850
 saying like that there are people who are not going very 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.620
 well and says that they do a lot of shit 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440
 but I've always gone well the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.090
 heart and I've always liked it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.490
 very much liked this goalkeeper and always 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.210
 he caught me for the barclays 85 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.830
 stretched 87 of reflections 82 of position and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.690
 the other is pretty bad but it 's a 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.810
 goalkeeper who is very much been very 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.800
 said before the next the next 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 for me it is from gea since it is Spanish 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.729
 and I think it's a very good goalie 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.990
 in theme quality price and above is one 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.489
 of the best goalkeepers of the barclays 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.040
 in 614 ultimate team 86 from stretched to 88 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.780
 reflexes that we are talking 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.940
 these two this stretch of reflexes is 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 better than peter che then what 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.080
 pite check better in stop 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.840
 de gea the best in serve and position 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.459
 he also wins peter check 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.019
 and good in speed I do not know why 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.550
 wants speed a lot there are people who 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.599
 yes he is very interested in the speed 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.459
 but to me it is not a point that has little 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.350
 speed a goalie I'm not going to 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.990
 sign for that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.720
 to me for me the next one is beautiful big 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.700
 since quality-price is very good already 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.700
 they give it to you at the discard price 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.690
 You can have 900 coins and you have 83 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.300
 of stretched 86 reflections 81 of stop 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.860
 78 positions a very good goalkeeper one 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.650
 of the best ones of the embrace the premier 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.410
 league without any doubt and quality-price 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.670
 they were gifted 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.830
 the next one is for another beast one 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.100
 bestiality of this 83 goalie 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.630
 stretched 84 reflex and 82 position 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 with this goalie I want to say that I 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.640
 I started with this goalie and I got out 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.380
 very many but many until the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.660
 final save and I sign peter check 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.870
 but this goalie to start is very 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.790
 well even to have it in the league 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.700
 forever because he is a goalkeeper who 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.440
 It is very good and I love this 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.930
 goalie 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.680
 for 800 coins you can have and the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.670
 next the last one is my goalie ticket 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.210
 of Belgian liverpool 81 stretched 83's 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.430
 stop reflexes 81 and position 80 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.870
 doorman that you already see quality-price 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.330
 It's very good since they give it to my 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.080
 coins and that's very little for a 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.650
 gold card player only 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.750
 and also that is a porter 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.600
 and well we said goodbye here putting the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.420
 best 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 goalkeeper that air for me my point of 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.660
 view of the barclays line and for much 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.440
 people 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.780
 splitter check 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.460
 and now here we are going to dismiss us 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.930
 we see in the next video to be ascribed 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.930
 comment and until the next kids
