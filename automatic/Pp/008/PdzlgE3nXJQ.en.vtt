00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.010
 every day I keep discovering new and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 best features like blackberry bold 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.700
 so I decided to do something fun with 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 my video camera know and practice 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 with the assassins a group of young people 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 entrepreneurs who have achieved 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.730
 incredible movement within the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.730
 independent industry 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.010
 tell me how to start then look at 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.170
 reality we start as a store 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.360
 hit man exactly six years ago and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.130
 it starts all with a group of watts there was 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.710
 five partners who are very close friends of 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.989
 we got together we decided to do something 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.970
 together and rhodesia is a super place 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.830
 excellent music and going to all kinds of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.660
 people do not hitters people who love the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.300
 electronic music people who love 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 the hip hop everything as they created is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 virality behind rodez I was always 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.270
 this make a place thought 100% for 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 listen to music not to listen 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.020
 mainly electronic music inside 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.420
 of the different genres and the kind of 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.759
 people who were created like the kraut 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 of the place it was very natural actually 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.899
 as you say it is very diverse never very much 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 it was on kidnappers and I think that was 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.630
 a bit as part of the success of places 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.220
 and after climate rodesia if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.860
 mythology that actually in mexico in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.860
 that moment for that meter 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
