00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
here but it has 25 C constant discharge

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.680 
here but it has 25 C constant discharge
rate<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.710> 50/50<00:00:26.710> C<00:00:26.980> burst<00:00:27.850> discharge<00:00:28.480> so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
rate and a 50/50 C burst discharge so

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.240 
rate and a 50/50 C burst discharge so
that's<00:00:28.870> nice<00:00:29.170> that<00:00:29.440> it<00:00:29.560> gives<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:29.770> that<00:00:29.830> burst

that's nice that it gives you that burst
which<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.120> original<00:00:31.270> does<00:00:31.660> not<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:32.710> can<00:00:32.800> see

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
which the original does not you can see

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.279 
which the original does not you can see
here<00:00:33.309> it's<00:00:33.460> sure<00:00:34.059> though<00:00:34.239> it's<00:00:34.840> a<00:00:34.899> little<00:00:35.140> bit

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
here it's sure though it's a little bit

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.240 
here it's sure though it's a little bit
longer<00:00:36.570> than<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.630> original<00:00:37.920> let's<00:00:38.920> try<00:00:39.160> and

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
longer than the original let's try and

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.160 
longer than the original let's try and
line<00:00:39.370> them<00:00:39.550> up<00:00:39.670> there<00:00:39.910> that's<00:00:40.600> just<00:00:40.750> a<00:00:40.960> paper

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
line them up there that's just a paper

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.710 
line them up there that's just a paper
tab<00:00:41.440> or<00:00:41.770> not<00:00:42.100> paper<00:00:42.280> with<00:00:42.579> it's<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.390> little<00:00:43.570> bit

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
tab or not paper with it's a little bit

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.350 
tab or not paper with it's a little bit
longer<00:00:43.930> but<00:00:44.320> however<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.610> thinner<00:00:45.970> so<00:00:46.270> you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
longer but however it is thinner so you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.900 
longer but however it is thinner so you
can<00:00:46.510> still<00:00:46.780> use<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:46.989> I'll<00:00:47.290> show<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:47.560> here

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
can still use it I'll show you here

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.220 
can still use it I'll show you here
because<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.150> can<00:00:49.270> see<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.570> original<00:00:49.750> when<00:00:50.140> it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
because you can see the original when it

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.150 
because you can see the original when it
goes<00:00:50.410> in<00:00:51.239> cousin<00:00:52.239> like<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.660> I<00:00:53.040> don't<00:00:54.040> wanna

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
goes in cousin like that I don't wanna

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.560 
goes in cousin like that I don't wanna
how<00:00:54.310> well<00:00:54.550> it's<00:00:54.700> gonna<00:00:54.820> show<00:00:55.030> up<00:00:55.180> but<00:00:55.360> there's

just hovering and just real small
movements<00:02:01.030> I've<00:02:01.119> been<00:02:01.240> getting<00:02:01.479> about<00:02:01.740> 14<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
movements I've been getting about 14 and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.770 
movements I've been getting about 14 and
a<00:02:02.950> half<00:02:02.979> minute<00:02:03.549> flights<00:02:03.850> on<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.299> compared

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
a half minute flights on this compared

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.309 
a half minute flights on this compared
to<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.049> like<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:06.040> 11<00:02:06.490> on<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:08.110> gret

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
to the like the 11 on this and a gret

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.050 
to the like the 11 on this and a gret
really<00:02:08.709> aggressive<00:02:09.220> flights<00:02:09.489> I'm<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:09.819> getting

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
really aggressive flights I'm in getting

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.270 
really aggressive flights I'm in getting
twelve<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.539> half<00:02:10.689> minutes<00:02:11.079> so<00:02:11.319> that's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
twelve and a half minutes so that's

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.770 
twelve and a half minutes so that's
really<00:02:12.549> nice<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.000> gives<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.300> lots<00:02:13.599> of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
really nice it gives you lots of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.600 
really nice it gives you lots of
extended<00:02:14.230> flight<00:02:14.410> time<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.920> haven't<00:02:15.489> done

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
extended flight time I haven't done

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.150 
extended flight time I haven't done
outside<00:02:16.000> yet<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.410> really<00:02:18.010> really

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
outside yet because it's really really

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.820 
outside yet because it's really really
cold<00:02:18.489> right

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
cold right

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.650 
cold right
the<00:02:19.130> batteries<00:02:19.730> don't<00:02:19.880> last<00:02:20.000> at<00:02:20.330> all<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.630> I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the batteries don't last at all so I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.900 
the batteries don't last at all so I
wouldn't<00:02:20.960> get<00:02:21.020> an<00:02:21.110> accurate<00:02:21.470> reading<00:02:21.910> take

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
wouldn't get an accurate reading take

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.740 
wouldn't get an accurate reading take
this<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.190> bit<00:02:25.370> um<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:26.690> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
this out it's a little bit um it's a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.870 
this out it's a little bit um it's a
little<00:02:27.020> bit<00:02:27.140> heavier<00:02:27.590> than<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> original

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
little bit heavier than the original

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.720 
little bit heavier than the original
there<00:02:29.120> but<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.960> by<00:02:30.170> much<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.710> but<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:31.550> of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there but not by much and but because of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.880 
there but not by much and but because of
that<00:02:31.940> higher<00:02:32.150> si<00:02:32.510> destroyed<00:02:32.990> rating<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.590> think

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that higher si destroyed rating I think

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.780 
that higher si destroyed rating I think
it<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.670> um<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.540> hovering<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:37.250> makes<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
it just um just hovering it makes it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.310 
it just um just hovering it makes it
it's<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.060> little<00:02:38.300> bit<00:02:38.450> more<00:02:38.600> unstable<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
it's a little bit more unstable and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.710 
it's a little bit more unstable and
it'll<00:02:39.770> sometimes<00:02:40.430> twitch<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.600> a

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
it'll sometimes twitch just just a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.380 
it'll sometimes twitch just just a
little<00:02:41.930> bit<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.850> maybe<00:02:43.850> like<00:02:44.240> that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
little bit like maybe like that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.760 
little bit like maybe like that
sometimes<00:02:45.490> but<00:02:46.490> just<00:02:47.210> just<00:02:47.660> normal<00:02:48.110> flying<00:02:48.350> it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
sometimes but just just normal flying it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.550 
sometimes but just just normal flying it
is<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> little<00:02:49.730> bit<00:02:49.910> more<00:02:50.270> unsteady<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.140> once

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
is a little bit more unsteady but once

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.200 
is a little bit more unsteady but once
you<00:02:51.710> pick<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.190> throttle<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:52.940> bursts

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
you pick up the throttle and that bursts

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.270 
you pick up the throttle and that bursts
discharge<00:02:53.900> rating<00:02:54.140> kicks<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.770> gives<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.100> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
discharge rating kicks in it gives it a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.550 
discharge rating kicks in it gives it a
little<00:02:56.210> bit<00:02:56.420> more<00:02:56.540> power<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.170> think<00:02:57.440> it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
little bit more power so I think it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.020 
little bit more power so I think it
actually<00:02:57.680> does<00:02:57.890> handle<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.550> little<00:02:58.640> bit<00:02:58.880> better

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
actually does handle a little bit better

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.140 
actually does handle a little bit better
with<00:02:59.270> this<00:02:59.420> upgraded<00:03:00.410> battery<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.010> one<00:03:02.000> thing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
with this upgraded battery and one thing

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.850 
with this upgraded battery and one thing
I<00:03:02.210> wanted<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.450> point<00:03:02.660> out<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.410> came<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.740> this

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
I wanted to point out it came in this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.490 
I wanted to point out it came in this
really<00:03:04.250> nice<00:03:04.400> tiny<00:03:04.850> little<00:03:05.090> box<00:03:05.390> from<00:03:06.230> Hobby

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
King it cost um the battery was only

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.180 
King it cost um the battery was only
four<00:03:11.630> dollars<00:03:11.660> from<00:03:12.110> their<00:03:12.290> us<00:03:12.530> warehouse<00:03:12.920> but

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
two of these you could um get two for

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.240 
two of these you could um get two for
$14<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.450> on<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> came<00:03:21.800> in<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.010> really

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
um this giant box here you can see how

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.000 
um this giant box here you can see how
big<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.489> is<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.940> came<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.830> sewing<00:03:39.830> on

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
big that is it came in this sewing on

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.940 
big that is it came in this sewing on
part<00:03:40.250> of<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.459> but<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:41.330> shipping<00:03:41.750> just<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.590> in

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
part of it but for shipping just this in

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.370 
part of it but for shipping just this in
this<00:03:43.730> giant<00:03:44.420> box<00:03:44.540> here<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.900> think<00:03:45.230> that's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
this giant box here I think that's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.330 
this giant box here I think that's
pretty<00:03:45.650> ridiculous

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
pretty ridiculous

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.940 
pretty ridiculous
this<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.300> all<00:03:47.450> filled<00:03:47.720> with<00:03:47.780> them<00:03:48.110> or<00:03:48.920> not

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this is just all filled with them or not

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.090 
this is just all filled with them or not
foam<00:03:49.370> plastic<00:03:50.270> air<00:03:50.690> bags<00:03:51.020> but<00:03:51.850> um<00:03:52.850> let's<00:03:53.510> see

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
foam plastic air bags but um let's see

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.590 
foam plastic air bags but um let's see
the<00:03:55.100> UM<00:03:55.340> another<00:03:55.850> difference<00:03:56.270> between<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
the UM another difference between the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.900 
the UM another difference between the
two<00:03:56.840> batteries<00:03:57.050> is<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.100> wires<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.640> here

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
two batteries is that the wires on here

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.490 
two batteries is that the wires on here
are<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.090> little<00:03:59.239> bit<00:03:59.420> shorter<00:03:59.810> for<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.110> jst

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
are a little bit shorter for the jst

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.860 
are a little bit shorter for the jst
plug<00:04:00.770> they're<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.340> little<00:04:01.489> bit<00:04:01.670> thicker<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.209> on

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
plug they're a little bit thicker but on

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.380 
plug they're a little bit thicker but on
the<00:04:03.350> newer<00:04:03.860> battery<00:04:04.340> operated<00:04:04.790> one<00:04:05.060> they're

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
the newer battery operated one they're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.900 
the newer battery operated one they're
the<00:04:05.989> longer<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.590> shorter<00:04:06.830> wires<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.640> but

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the longer and shorter wires so but

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.130 
the longer and shorter wires so but
they're<00:04:08.209> still<00:04:08.390> thick<00:04:08.630> enough<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.020> you're

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
they're still thick enough that you're

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.050 
they're still thick enough that you're
not<00:04:09.260> gonna<00:04:09.380> break<00:04:09.620> them<00:04:09.860> easily<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.910> they're

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
not gonna break them easily like they're

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.229 
not gonna break them easily like they're
not<00:04:11.180> just<00:04:11.239> gonna<00:04:11.510> be<00:04:11.660> pinched<00:04:11.989> off<00:04:13.000> yeah<00:04:14.000> and

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
not just gonna be pinched off yeah and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.759 
not just gonna be pinched off yeah and
when<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.360> have<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:14.750> in<00:04:14.900> here<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.320> can<00:04:15.500> still

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
when you have it in here you can still

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.949 
when you have it in here you can still
tuck<00:04:16.190> all<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> wires<00:04:16.820> up<00:04:17.269> under<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> nose

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
tuck all the wires up under the nose

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.479 
tuck all the wires up under the nose
here<00:04:18.169> just<00:04:18.410> push<00:04:18.560> them<00:04:18.680> back<00:04:18.859> in<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.310> there

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
here just push them back in so there

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.510 
here just push them back in so there
it's<00:04:19.880> not<00:04:20.000> waiting<00:04:20.419> hidden<00:04:20.919> not<00:04:21.919> it's<00:04:22.220> hidden

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
it's not waiting hidden not it's hidden

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.730 
it's not waiting hidden not it's hidden
and<00:04:22.700> not<00:04:22.820> ugly<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.300> hanging<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:24.650> you

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
and not ugly and hanging out so you

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.969 
and not ugly and hanging out so you
won't<00:04:24.890> catch<00:04:25.790> them<00:04:25.820> on<00:04:26.090> anything<00:04:26.979> yeah

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
won't catch them on anything yeah

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.460 
won't catch them on anything yeah
they're<00:04:28.250> not<00:04:28.400> it's<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.910> good<00:04:29.270> good<00:04:29.750> long

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
they're not it's just a good good long

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.750 
they're not it's just a good good long
life<00:04:30.800> battery

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
life battery

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.420 
life battery
good<00:04:32.540> flight<00:04:32.810> improvement<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.100> think<00:04:34.340> it

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
good flight improvement and I think it

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.800 
good flight improvement and I think it
actually<00:04:34.520> does<00:04:34.700> make<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.180> fly<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.390> little<00:04:35.570> bit

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
actually does make it fly a little bit

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.170 
actually does make it fly a little bit
better<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.170> not<00:04:36.320> it's<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.710> little<00:04:36.920> bit<00:04:37.490> less

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
better it's not it's a little bit less

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.570 
better it's not it's a little bit less
stable<00:04:38.420> and<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.960> absolute<00:04:39.800> hover<00:04:40.040> but<00:04:40.280> flying

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
stable and a absolute hover but flying

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.320 
stable and a absolute hover but flying
around<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.060> does<00:04:41.210> great<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:43.000> I'll<00:04:44.000> do<00:04:44.300> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
around it does great and I'll do a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.670 
around it does great and I'll do a
little<00:04:44.510> indoor<00:04:44.960> flight<00:04:45.200> to<00:04:45.380> show<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
little indoor flight to show you the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.350 
little indoor flight to show you the
stability<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.250> I'll<00:04:46.460> do<00:04:46.610> some<00:04:46.790> files<00:04:47.030> and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
stability and I'll do some files and

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.150 
stability and I'll do some files and
some<00:04:47.870> throttle<00:04:48.080> punches<00:04:48.560> just<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.920> show<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
some throttle punches just to show you

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.460 
some throttle punches just to show you
the<00:04:49.460> higher<00:04:49.850> discharge<00:04:50.360> rate<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:50.840> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
the higher discharge rate of this and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.830 
the higher discharge rate of this and
that's<00:04:52.160> about<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:52.970> it's<00:04:53.420> great<00:04:53.540> little

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
that's about it so it's great little

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.390 
that's about it so it's great little
battery<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:54.350> do<00:04:54.680> recommend<00:04:55.040> it<00:04:55.280> there'll

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
battery and I do recommend it there'll

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.430 
battery and I do recommend it there'll
be<00:04:55.430> links<00:04:55.670> below<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.270> let's<00:04:57.020> go<00:04:57.140> check<00:04:57.320> out

be links below and let's go check out

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980 
be links below and let's go check out
the<00:04:57.590> flight<00:04:57.800> okay<00:04:58.610> here<00:04:58.880> are<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.180> flight<00:04:59.750> of

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
the flight okay here are the flight of

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.710 
the flight okay here are the flight of
the<00:05:00.170> drama<00:05:00.860> ominous<00:05:01.340> with<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.970> upgraded

the drama ominous with the upgraded
turnigy<00:05:03.140> nanotech<00:05:03.680> battery<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:05.180> see<00:05:05.360> I've

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
turnigy nanotech battery you see I've

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.060 
turnigy nanotech battery you see I've
got<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.720> plugged<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:05.990> there<00:05:06.200> and<00:05:06.470> all<00:05:06.920> the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
got it plugged in there and all the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.790 
got it plugged in there and all the
wires<00:05:07.340> fit<00:05:07.880> they<00:05:08.540> fit<00:05:08.810> nice<00:05:09.050> up<00:05:09.320> under<00:05:09.620> the

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
wires fit they fit nice up under the

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.950 
wires fit they fit nice up under the
nose<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.030> canopy<00:05:11.360> there<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:11.810> they're

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
nose and the canopy there so they're

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.930 
nose and the canopy there so they're
nice<00:05:12.170> and<00:05:12.200> hidden<00:05:12.500> away<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.280> let's<00:05:13.520> take<00:05:13.760> it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
nice and hidden away so let's take it

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.020 
nice and hidden away so let's take it
put<00:05:14.570> out<00:05:14.660> in<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.840> ground<00:05:15.050> first<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:16.520> reset

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
put out in the ground first I just reset

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.580 
put out in the ground first I just reset
all<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.180> trims<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:17.750> recalibrated<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
all the trims and recalibrated the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:28.250 
all the trims and recalibrated the
accelerometer<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:19.490> off<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.730> trim<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.030> out<00:05:20.120> here

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.250 

yeah

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.900 

as<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:36.830> can<00:05:37.010> see<00:05:37.250> there<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.460> don't<00:05:37.700> know<00:05:37.790> if

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
as you can see there I don't know if

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.100 
as you can see there I don't know if
you'll<00:05:38.060> be<00:05:38.150> able<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.360> tell<00:05:38.570> but<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:38.960> is

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
you'll be able to tell but it is

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.790 
you'll be able to tell but it is
wobbling<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.710> little<00:05:39.740> bit<00:05:40.750> this<00:05:41.750> extra<00:05:42.470> battery

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
wobbling a little bit this extra battery

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.220 
wobbling a little bit this extra battery
wait<00:05:43.010> out<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.430> front<00:05:43.750> changes<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.870> center<00:05:45.170> of

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
wait out the front changes the center of

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.670 
wait out the front changes the center of
gravity<00:05:45.620> though<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:47.720> can<00:05:47.900> see<00:05:48.140> it<00:05:48.230> it's<00:05:48.470> not

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
gravity though you can see it it's not

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.470 
gravity though you can see it it's not
quite<00:05:48.920> as<00:05:49.040> stable<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.580> just<00:05:49.610> gonna<00:05:49.880> hover<00:05:50.120> but

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
quite as stable and just gonna hover but

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:01.890

it's<00:05:51.110> still<00:05:51.350> not<00:05:51.500> bad<00:05:53.290> sorry<00:05:54.290> -<00:05:54.680> same<00:05:58.960> whoops

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
it's still not bad sorry - same whoops

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's still not bad sorry - same whoops
that<00:06:02.900> was<00:06:03.230> it<00:06:03.380> -<00:06:03.530> good<00:06:03.740> my<00:06:04.610> table<00:06:05.000> there

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.689 

okay<00:06:13.440> let's<00:06:13.650> do<00:06:13.889> a<00:06:13.919> throttle<00:06:14.550> punch<00:06:14.730> here<00:06:16.699> you

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
okay let's do a throttle punch here you

okay let's do a throttle punch here you
see<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:17.910> think<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.300> that's<00:06:18.870> either<00:06:19.139> just

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
see I think that that's either just

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.900 
see I think that that's either just
about<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.830> same<00:06:20.070> or<00:06:20.340> a<00:06:20.400> little<00:06:20.790> bit<00:06:20.880> more

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
about the same or a little bit more

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.650 
about the same or a little bit more
power<00:06:21.300> than<00:06:21.600> the<00:06:21.750> original<00:06:22.669> battery

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:39.450

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.640

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
don't really have enough room in this

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.370 
don't really have enough room in this
room<00:06:41.800> here<00:06:42.130> to<00:06:42.220> go<00:06:42.310> funnel<00:06:42.699> but<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:44.080> I<00:06:44.199> picked

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
room here to go funnel but and I picked

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.360 
room here to go funnel but and I picked
open<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.680> room<00:06:44.830> again<00:06:45.190> really

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.629

doing<00:07:06.969> a<00:07:07.060> separate<00:07:07.419> video<00:07:07.599> on<00:07:07.780> the<00:07:08.020> upgraded

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:08.439 
doing a separate video on the upgraded

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.689 
doing a separate video on the upgraded
motors<00:07:08.710> and<00:07:08.949> this<00:07:10.949> you<00:07:11.949> see<00:07:12.159> it<00:07:12.250> just<00:07:12.430> still

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
motors and this you see it just still

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.790 
motors and this you see it just still
flies<00:07:13.000> really<00:07:13.389> nice<00:07:13.569> just<00:07:14.020> like<00:07:14.229> the<00:07:14.379> original

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
flies really nice just like the original

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.999 
flies really nice just like the original
it<00:07:14.830> just<00:07:15.099> gives<00:07:15.310> you<00:07:15.370> a<00:07:15.460> longer<00:07:15.699> flight<00:07:15.939> time

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
it just gives you a longer flight time

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.980 
it just gives you a longer flight time
for<00:07:18.009> a<00:07:18.039> ten<00:07:18.400> dollar<00:07:18.550> battery<00:07:19.090> or<00:07:19.300> fourteen<00:07:19.810> for

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
for a ten dollar battery or fourteen for

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:27.860 
for a ten dollar battery or fourteen for
two<00:07:20.169> I<00:07:20.909> think<00:07:21.909> it's<00:07:22.210> a<00:07:22.300> really<00:07:22.419> nice<00:07:22.629> upgrade<00:07:23.080> I

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.990 

think<00:07:28.870> that<00:07:28.990> was<00:07:29.080> good<00:07:29.289> enough<00:07:29.349> it's<00:07:29.819> same<00:07:30.819> as

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
think that was good enough it's same as

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.480 
think that was good enough it's same as
the<00:07:31.090> original<00:07:31.509> it's<00:07:31.659> just<00:07:31.930> gives<00:07:32.289> you<00:07:32.500> more

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
the original it's just gives you more

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.189 
the original it's just gives you more
flight<00:07:33.819> time<00:07:34.060> so<00:07:34.300> yeah<00:07:34.569> that's<00:07:34.810> the<00:07:35.050> end<00:07:35.080> of

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 
flight time so yeah that's the end of

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.480 
flight time so yeah that's the end of
the<00:07:35.289> video<00:07:35.469> on<00:07:35.800> there'll<00:07:36.069> be<00:07:36.129> links<00:07:36.370> to
