00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.299 

we<00:00:09.269> got<00:00:09.420> two<00:00:10.080> things<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> talk<00:00:10.710> about<00:00:10.769> we've

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
we got two things to talk about we've

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
we got two things to talk about we've
got<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> mpg<00:00:12.059> cap<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
got the mpg cap and I think all of you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.379 
got the mpg cap and I think all of you
are<00:00:13.380> familiar<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.969> we've<00:00:15.120> got<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
are familiar with that so we've got the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.040 
are familiar with that so we've got the
mpg<00:00:15.900> booster<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:17.970> new<00:00:18.449> liquid

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
mpg booster and that is the new liquid

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.450 
mpg booster and that is the new liquid
form<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> mpg<00:00:21.810> cap<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> I'd

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
form of the mpg cap the things that I'd

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.150 
form of the mpg cap the things that I'd
like<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> talk<00:00:23.910> about<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> how

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like to talk about is what is it how

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.390 
like to talk about is what is it how
does<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> work<00:00:26.930> prove<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> then<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
does it work prove it and then will it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 
does it work prove it and then will it
work<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.029> car<00:00:30.330> that's<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.769> bottom

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
work in my car that's really the bottom

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
work in my car that's really the bottom
line<00:00:32.300> what<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:34.520> pill<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.210> have

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
line what it is that pill that you have

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.690 
line what it is that pill that you have
that<00:00:36.899> you're<00:00:37.050> selling<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.219> liquid<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
that you're selling and the liquid that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080 
that you're selling and the liquid that
you<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:40.860> combustion<00:00:41.399> catalyst

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you will have is a combustion catalyst

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840 
you will have is a combustion catalyst
and<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> exactly<00:00:43.680> true<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.610> what

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
and that's not exactly true because what

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.680 
and that's not exactly true because what
you've<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you've got is the way to get the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.400 
you've got is the way to get the
combustion<00:00:49.110> catalyst<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> precursor

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
combustion catalyst it's the precursor

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
combustion catalyst it's the precursor
and<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> fuel<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.510> because

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and you put it in the fuel just because

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
and you put it in the fuel just because
the<00:00:55.020> fuel<00:00:55.289> goes<00:00:55.559> into<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> engine<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the fuel goes into the engine into the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.500 
the fuel goes into the engine into the
combustion<00:00:57.180> chamber<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.820> what<00:00:59.820> happens<00:01:00.359> when

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
combustion chamber and what happens when

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
combustion chamber and what happens when
it<00:01:00.780> goes<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.010> liberates<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
it goes in there is it liberates the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
it goes in there is it liberates the
catalytic<00:01:04.530> material<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> then

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
catalytic material that is then

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.490 
catalytic material that is then
deposited<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> piston<00:01:08.970> face<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
deposited on the piston face and the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
deposited on the piston face and the
fire<00:01:10.680> deck<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> head<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
fire deck which is the head the top of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.140 
fire deck which is the head the top of
the<00:01:12.630> engine<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.979> fact<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> spark<00:01:14.880> plug

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the engine and in fact on the spark plug

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840 
the engine and in fact on the spark plug
and<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> few<00:01:16.950> things<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.729> think

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and one of the few things that I think

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.210 
and one of the few things that I think
are<00:01:18.210> memorable<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.229> worth<00:01:19.439> taking<00:01:19.830> away<00:01:20.009> from

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
are memorable and worth taking away from

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
are memorable and worth taking away from
this<00:01:20.369> meeting<00:01:20.610> what<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.540> saying<00:01:21.869> today<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this meeting what I'm saying today is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
this meeting what I'm saying today is
that<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:24.060> best<00:01:24.740> salesman<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.580> spark

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that your best salesman is the spark

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.929 
that your best salesman is the spark
plug<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:28.020> customers<00:01:28.500> car<00:01:28.939> after

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
plug from your customers car after

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
plug from your customers car after
they've<00:01:30.180> done<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> conditioning<00:01:31.340> because

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they've done the conditioning because

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
they've done the conditioning because
when<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.700> pull<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> spark<00:01:33.420> plug<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.869> it'll

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
when they pull that spark plug out it'll

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.450 
when they pull that spark plug out it'll
be<00:01:34.409> red<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:37.409> reason<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
be red that is the reason that it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
be red that is the reason that it's
effective<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.150> their<00:01:39.329> car<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.900> that's<00:01:40.470> all

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
effective in their car and that's all

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.649 
effective in their car and that's all
you<00:01:41.460> need<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> know

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.289 

what<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.690> combustion<00:01:49.110> catalyst<00:01:49.710> does<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.340> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
what a combustion catalyst does is this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.530 
what a combustion catalyst does is this
this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> pit<00:01:52.470> fire<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.100> Norway<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.450> an

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
this is a pit fire in Norway and it's an

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.320 
this is a pit fire in Norway and it's an
exactly<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:01:55.560> amount<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.100> crude<00:01:56.790> oil<00:01:56.970> in

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
exactly the same amount of crude oil in

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.960 
exactly the same amount of crude oil in
both<00:01:57.750> pit<00:01:58.680> fires<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.479> without<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
both pit fires this is without the

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.910 
both pit fires this is without the
catalyst<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.470> catalyst

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
catalyst and this is with the catalyst

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
catalyst and this is with the catalyst
only<00:02:05.700> difference<00:02:06.090> except<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:07.110> was<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> little

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
only difference except it was a little

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.729 
only difference except it was a little
bit<00:02:07.860> lighter<00:02:08.819> day<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:09.869> had<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.259> adjust

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
bit lighter day so they had to adjust

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.220 
bit lighter day so they had to adjust
the<00:02:11.150> because<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:12.300> was<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.600> little<00:02:12.630> smoke

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the because there was so little smoke

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.840 
the because there was so little smoke
they<00:02:13.470> had<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.709> adjust<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> focus<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
they had to adjust the focus on the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.760 
they had to adjust the focus on the
camera<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.360> why<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.630> sky<00:02:16.050> looks<00:02:16.319> darker

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
camera that's why the sky looks darker

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.650 
camera that's why the sky looks darker
they<00:02:17.190> were<00:02:17.250> trying<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> show<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.390> little

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
they were trying to show what little

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.030 
they were trying to show what little
smoke<00:02:18.900> just<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:19.470> was<00:02:19.620> some<00:02:19.860> smoke

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
smoke just that there was some smoke

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.949 
smoke just that there was some smoke
left<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> combustion<00:02:21.480> catalyst
