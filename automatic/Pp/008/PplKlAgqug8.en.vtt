mouthful if you guys don't know what

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.630 
mouthful if you guys don't know what
hard<00:00:19.109> point<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> about<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> my

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
hard point is about it's one of my

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.620 
hard point is about it's one of my
favorite<00:00:21.449> game<00:00:21.660> modes<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> works<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
favorite game modes and how it works is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.679 
favorite game modes and how it works is
the<00:00:24.630> hardpoint<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.800> I'd<00:00:26.310> say<00:00:26.609> capture<00:00:27.359> area

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the hardpoint or I'd say capture area

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.260 
the hardpoint or I'd say capture area
will<00:00:28.619> move<00:00:28.890> through<00:00:29.660> usually<00:00:30.660> four<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.830> five

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
will move through usually four to five

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
will move through usually four to five
predetermined<00:00:33.270> locations<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.110> map<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:35.010> lot

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
predetermined locations on the map a lot

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.069 
predetermined locations on the map a lot
of<00:00:35.520> people<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.870> should<00:00:37.050> be

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of people are like well it should be

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.410 
of people are like well it should be
random<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> mean<00:00:38.399> by<00:00:38.460> random<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
random and what I mean by random is the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
random and what I mean by random is the
hardpoint<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.440> areas<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
hardpoint will move to areas that you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.280 
hardpoint will move to areas that you
cannot<00:00:41.399> predict<00:00:41.910> while<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> current

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
cannot predict while in the current

hardpoint<00:00:43.829> game<00:00:44.160> type<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.030> predetermine

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
hardpoint game type you can predetermine

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
hardpoint game type you can predetermine
where<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> hardpoint<00:00:46.860> will<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.219> after<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
where the hardpoint will be after you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
where the hardpoint will be after you
play<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.510> maybe<00:00:49.170> five<00:00:49.770> minutes<00:00:50.010> you'd

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
play for about maybe five minutes you'd

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.350 
play for about maybe five minutes you'd
be<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.460> okay<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be like okay it's going to go to the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.790 
be like okay it's going to go to the
back<00:00:51.510> kitchen<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.079> gonna<00:00:52.170> go<00:00:52.320> under<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
back kitchen it's gonna go under the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.270 
back kitchen it's gonna go under the
ship<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.390> every<00:00:54.390> map<00:00:54.809> basically<00:00:55.680> there<00:00:56.250> are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
ship on every map basically there are

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
ship on every map basically there are
plenty<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.149> pictures<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.930> different<00:00:58.440> wikis

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
plenty of pictures on different wikis

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
plenty of pictures on different wikis
for<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> capture<00:01:00.300> point<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
for like where the capture point will be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
for like where the capture point will be
but<00:01:01.289> once<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> play<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> map<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.280> hard<00:01:02.640> point

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
but once you play the map on hard point

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
but once you play the map on hard point
you<00:01:03.059> will<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> kind<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you will just know I kind of like that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
you will just know I kind of like that
because<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.150> your<00:01:06.330> teammates<00:01:06.840> set

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
because you can have your teammates set

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.130 
because you can have your teammates set
up<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.100> area<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.450> enemies<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> try

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
up in that area and the enemies can try

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.570 
up in that area and the enemies can try
and<00:01:10.200> step<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> area<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and step in the area when it's about to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240 
and step in the area when it's about to
flip<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> adds<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.840> meta<00:01:13.260> game<00:01:13.500> too

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
flip I think it adds more meta game too

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
flip I think it adds more meta game too
hard<00:01:14.549> point<00:01:14.820> instead<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.360> being<00:01:15.479> random

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hard point instead of just being random

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.080 
hard point instead of just being random
and<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.350> luck<00:01:16.619> based<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.640> let's<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.030> turn

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and really luck based so let's now turn

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
and really luck based so let's now turn
to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.689> question<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> video<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.340> guys

some<00:02:51.470> other<00:02:51.709> things<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.130> think<00:02:52.160> about<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
some other things to think about is the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.910 
some other things to think about is the
timer<00:02:53.300> under<00:02:53.720> your<00:02:53.870> mini-map<00:02:54.290> which<00:02:54.740> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
timer under your mini-map which the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.270 
timer under your mini-map which the
hardpoint<00:02:55.370> switches<00:02:55.820> every<00:02:56.000> 60<00:02:56.780> seconds<00:02:57.530> that

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
hardpoint switches every 60 seconds that

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.030 
hardpoint switches every 60 seconds that
is<00:02:58.310> one<00:02:58.820> way<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.060> can<00:02:59.360> pre-plan<00:03:00.080> when<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.920> be

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
is one way you can pre-plan when to be

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.770 
is one way you can pre-plan when to be
rushing<00:03:01.490> or<00:03:01.640> having<00:03:01.910> your<00:03:01.940> team<00:03:02.209> set<00:03:02.540> up<00:03:02.660> in
