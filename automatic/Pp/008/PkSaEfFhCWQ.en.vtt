00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.390
 and the most important thing is that that 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.150
 transform into learning because the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.200
 memory has different times 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.690
 different types of memory and what 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.040

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.130
 we also prepare some myths and truths 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.250
 and he is with the little signs for 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.990

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.330
 habits there are a lot of things that 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.949
 drugs commonly one thinks that they are 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.760
 related to the memory exactly 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 beginning 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.930

 I take off with the raisin 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:11.330
 the stability but if the pass is 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.140
 moisturize and the process of dehydrating 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 lose vitamins lose and lose 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.030
 properties because what is behind 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 it happens in the grape and more than water or 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.740
 grape juice are the antioxidants are 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.729

 one key 4 and the b 5 study 7 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.590
 are those that enhance memory are 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.149
 associated with an improvement over time and in 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.100
 the performance of what you want 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.630
 remember where you have been like high

 yes the reality is the following attention 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.130
 being forgetful is the first symptom of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 alzheimer 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 true myth jaime 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.430
 Mira is a complicated question in health 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.790
 we talk about the team and its team 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.500
 and means certainty or reasonable doubt 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.480
 some people can be myth other 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.900
 people can be reality as it should be 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.900
 of knowing 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.459
 and if I have a risk factor for 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.010
 start an Alzheimer's picture already in that 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.489
 person start forgetting things 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.489
 may be a clue added factor of the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 tip 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.769
 risk factor there are several that are 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 recognized there are several are recognized 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.849
 first married men we are more 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 protected than single men from 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:43.090
 have Alzheimer's 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 there is a direct relationship because they have 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 Less possibility of partner consumption 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.760
 which has been shown that following 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:07.660
 populations that for every 17 people 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.860
 single that the relationship 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.110
 that I think you have to link 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760
 with having someone next to him 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.910
 be alone the exit suddenly has 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.549
 negative things and if one does not know how to tolerate 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.410
 no no no no you have as tools 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.599
 to handle you, most likely, 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.599
 start having problems that can 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.790
 derive to the concerns being 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.470
 single and there are more worries being 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.670
 in pairs you are married is more 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.200
 clear responsibility 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.910
 If you are married, you forget that you are 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.000
 married pull out the crest so too 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.000
