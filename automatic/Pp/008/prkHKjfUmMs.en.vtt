adjunct professor of biology and today
we're<00:00:09.300> gonna<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.750> fun<00:00:09.990> with

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
we're gonna have a little fun with

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.770 
we're gonna have a little fun with
Mendelian<00:00:10.769> punnett<00:00:11.070> squares<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.940> before<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
Mendelian punnett squares now before we

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.629 
Mendelian punnett squares now before we
get<00:00:12.900> started<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> jumping<00:00:13.889> into<00:00:14.040> our<00:00:14.190> punnett

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
get started and jumping into our punnett

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.790 
get started and jumping into our punnett
square<00:00:14.849> problems<00:00:15.330> let's<00:00:16.049> sit<00:00:16.320> down<00:00:16.350> some

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
square problems let's sit down some

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.310 
square problems let's sit down some
ground<00:00:17.100> rules<00:00:17.390> first<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:18.990> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> talk

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
ground rules first we're going to talk

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
ground rules first we're going to talk
about<00:00:19.350> alleles<00:00:19.980> alleles<00:00:20.880> are<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> be

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
about alleles alleles are going to be

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.109 
about alleles alleles are going to be
like<00:00:21.869> different<00:00:22.260> flavors<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.800> genes<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.730> you

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
like different flavors of genes so you

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.029 
like different flavors of genes so you
go<00:00:24.240> into<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> ice-cream<00:00:24.810> shop<00:00:25.080> there's<00:00:25.619> 31

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
go into the ice-cream shop there's 31

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.920 
go into the ice-cream shop there's 31
flavors<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.640> ice<00:00:26.730> cream<00:00:26.789> even<00:00:27.570> though<00:00:27.810> they're

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
flavors of ice cream even though they're

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
flavors of ice cream even though they're
all<00:00:27.960> different<00:00:28.380> flavors<00:00:28.470> they're<00:00:29.279> all<00:00:29.429> still

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
all different flavors they're all still

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
all different flavors they're all still
ice<00:00:29.820> cream<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.480> alleles<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.679> be

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
ice cream right alleles are gonna be

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
ice cream right alleles are gonna be
those<00:00:31.949> different<00:00:32.489> flavors<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> genes<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
those different flavors of genes that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
those different flavors of genes that
you<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.110> available<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.700> next<00:00:36.030> thing

you have available to you the next thing

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
you have available to you the next thing
I<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> talk<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.020> dominant<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I want to talk about is dominant and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.639 
I want to talk about is dominant and
recessive<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.670> any<00:00:39.239> relationship<00:00:39.960> some<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
recessive in any relationship some of

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.959 
recessive in any relationship some of
those<00:00:40.739> alleles<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.550> dominant

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
those alleles are going to be dominant

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.430 
those alleles are going to be dominant
and<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.750> those<00:00:42.840> alleles<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and some of those alleles are going to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
and some of those alleles are going to
be<00:00:43.530> recessive<00:00:43.920> those<00:00:44.700> dominant<00:00:45.270> alleles<00:00:45.480> if

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
be recessive those dominant alleles if

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
be recessive those dominant alleles if
they're<00:00:45.989> present<00:00:46.469> they're<00:00:47.039> gonna<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.460> more

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
they're present they're gonna have more

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.880 
they're present they're gonna have more
of<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> say<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.780> what<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> outcome<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
of a say in what the outcome of that

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
of a say in what the outcome of that
cross<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.510> recessives

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
cross is going to be and the recessives

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.600 
cross is going to be and the recessives
well<00:00:52.680> they're<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.460> no

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
well they're going to have little to no

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.420 
well they're going to have little to no
say<00:00:54.090> unless<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.500> recessive<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
say unless there are two recessive that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
say unless there are two recessive that
are<00:00:56.520> available<00:00:56.670> also<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:58.170> each<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> our

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
are available also in each of our

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
are available also in each of our
crosses<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:00.690> allele

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
crosses we're going to have one allele

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
crosses we're going to have one allele
from<00:01:01.170> our<00:01:01.320> mother<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:02.370> allele<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.820> our

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
from our mother and one allele from our

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.719 
from our mother and one allele from our
father<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:04.049> let's<00:01:04.619> jump<00:01:04.890> into<00:01:05.070> our<00:01:05.189> crosses

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
father now let's jump into our crosses

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
father now let's jump into our crosses
today<00:01:06.510> we're<00:01:06.930> gonna<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> 4<00:01:07.590> squared<00:01:07.890> punnett

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
today we're gonna do a 4 squared punnett

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.969 
today we're gonna do a 4 squared punnett
square<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> start<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.650> just

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
square so you want to start out by just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
square so you want to start out by just
join<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> square<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.630> Square<00:01:13.140> you're

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
join a square in that Square you're

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.780 
join a square in that Square you're
gonna<00:01:13.500> draw<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> line<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> middle

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
gonna draw a line right down the middle

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.820 
gonna draw a line right down the middle
from<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> top<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> bottom<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.259> aligned

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
from the top to the bottom and aligned

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
from the top to the bottom and aligned
from<00:01:17.040> left<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.960> 4

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
from left to right now you have 4

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
from left to right now you have 4
individual<00:01:19.860> squares<00:01:20.130> each<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.180> those<00:01:21.330> squares

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
individual squares each of those squares

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.289 
individual squares each of those squares
is<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> probability<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.580> each<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is going to be a probability and each of

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.620 
is going to be a probability and each of
those<00:01:24.390> squares<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> 1/4<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.520> 25%

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
those squares is 1/4 right or 25%

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.170 
those squares is 1/4 right or 25%
next<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.430> our<00:01:29.549> parents

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
next we're going to put our parents

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.660 
next we're going to put our parents
alleles<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.320> punnett<00:01:31.680> square<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
alleles on the punnett square now it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
alleles on the punnett square now it
doesn't<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.030> matter<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:33.990> male<00:01:34.290> or

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
doesn't really matter if you put male or

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.740 
doesn't really matter if you put male or
female<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.009> top<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.939> generally<00:01:36.509> people

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the phenotypes of your parents even

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.860 
the phenotypes of your parents even
though<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:38.940> won't<00:03:39.299> know<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.450> exact

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
though you won't know the exact

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.110 
though you won't know the exact
genotypes<00:03:40.470> or<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> genetic<00:03:41.220> makeup<00:03:41.639> behind

genotypes or the genetic makeup behind

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
genotypes or the genetic makeup behind
what<00:03:42.480> you're<00:03:42.569> seeing<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> outside<00:03:43.250> do

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
what you're seeing on the outside do

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250 
what you're seeing on the outside do
some<00:03:44.459> crosses<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.120> see<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.870> could<00:03:46.019> find

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
some crosses and see if you could find

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.500 
some crosses and see if you could find
out<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.590> probability<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.970> could<00:03:48.420> have

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
out the probability that you could have

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.229 
out the probability that you could have
actually<00:03:48.750> had<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> different<00:03:49.680> eye<00:03:49.799> color

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
actually had a different eye color

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.430 
actually had a different eye color
