point out first off it is waterproof

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
point out first off it is waterproof
it's<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.700> those<00:00:41.879> features<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.410> also

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with a 64-bit octa-core processor the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
with a 64-bit octa-core processor the
setup<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.960> CPUs<00:01:28.229> each<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
setup is actually two CPUs each with

setup is actually two CPUs each with
four<00:01:29.610> cores

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
four cores

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
four cores
one<00:01:30.570> CPU<00:01:30.810> handles<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> heaviest<00:01:31.920> workloads

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
one CPU handles the heaviest workloads

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.490 
one CPU handles the heaviest workloads
and<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.030> other<00:01:33.150> handles<00:01:33.600> lighter<00:01:33.960> workloads

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and the other handles lighter workloads

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.200 
and the other handles lighter workloads
so<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> give<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> faster

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so that it's going to give you faster

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
so that it's going to give you faster
apps<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.720> longer<00:01:37.140> battery<00:01:37.259> life<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.159> RAM<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
apps and longer battery life the RAM is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850 
apps and longer battery life the RAM is
two<00:01:38.790> gigs<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.570> jumping<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> camera

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
two gigs and now jumping to the camera

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
two gigs and now jumping to the camera
so<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.460> course<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> back<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> 13

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so of course on the back you have a 13

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
so of course on the back you have a 13
megapixel<00:01:43.380> camera<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> front<00:01:44.970> facing

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
megapixel camera but on the front facing
