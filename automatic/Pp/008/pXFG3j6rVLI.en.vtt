going to act upon right now and that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
going to act upon right now and that's
more<00:01:05.340> to<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:06.120> with<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> fact<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.990> would

more to do with the fact that we would

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070 
more to do with the fact that we would

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
like to concentrate on the 306 50

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
like to concentrate on the 306 50
because<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> issues<00:01:10.980> of<00:01:11.280> supplies<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.270> have

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
because of issues of supplies we have

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620 
because of issues of supplies we have
far<00:01:13.230> from<00:01:13.620> tapped<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.850> entire<00:01:15.150> potential

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
far from tapped the entire potential

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.130 
far from tapped the entire potential
that<00:01:15.810> exists<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:18.150> keep<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> focus<00:01:18.780> on

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that exists and to keep the focus on

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740 
that exists and to keep the focus on
these<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.560> products<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.570> our

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
these two products we do not want our

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.740 
these two products we do not want our
attention<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.979> diverted<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:24.270> having<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
attention to get diverted in having a

very large portfolio because along with

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.000 
very large portfolio because along with
that<00:01:27.690> comes<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:29.690> spare<00:01:30.690> parts<00:01:30.990> inventory<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
required at the dealerships so we would

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
than you know expand and then do a good

than you know expand and then do a good
job<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.580

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
would consider as one lakh rupees and

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.139 
would consider as one lakh rupees and
above<00:01:52.200> maybe<00:01:52.530> three<00:01:52.799> years<00:01:52.950> back<00:01:53.219> 70,000<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
above maybe three years back 70,000 and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.929 
above maybe three years back 70,000 and
about<00:01:54.390> could<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.719> considered<00:01:54.990> premium<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.069> it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
about could be considered premium now it

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.010 
about could be considered premium now it
is<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:58.020> lakh<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.409> above<00:01:58.649> the<00:02:00.020> but

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is more like one lakh and above the but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.510 
is more like one lakh and above the but
what<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:02.600> hypothesis<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.899> correct<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
what your hypothesis is correct in the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.699 
what your hypothesis is correct in the
sense<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.939> yes<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> look<00:02:07.590> at

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
sense that yes so if you look at

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.600 
sense that yes so if you look at
manufacturers<00:02:08.519> who<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.170> portfolio

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
manufacturers who do have a portfolio

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.869 
manufacturers who do have a portfolio
which<00:02:11.610> ranges<00:02:12.090> from<00:02:12.150> let's<00:02:12.989> say<00:02:13.310> sub<00:02:14.310> 3<00:02:14.640> lakhs

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
which ranges from let's say sub 3 lakhs

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.900 
which ranges from let's say sub 3 lakhs
to<00:02:15.239> all<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.110> maybe<00:02:16.470> 20<00:02:16.950> lakhs<00:02:17.160> it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to all the way up to maybe 20 lakhs it's

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.089 
to all the way up to maybe 20 lakhs it's
a<00:02:18.060> very<00:02:18.360> very<00:02:18.660> miniscule<00:02:19.349> percentage<00:02:19.560> of

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
a very very miniscule percentage of

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.860 
a very very miniscule percentage of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
their sales that come in the you know

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.960 
their sales that come in the you know
from<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.380> expensive<00:02:22.890> bikes<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.370> in

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
from the expensive bikes and and and in

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.300 
from the expensive bikes and and and in
some<00:02:30.329> manner<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.140> also<00:02:31.319> contributed<00:02:32.099> by

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
some manner it is also contributed by

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.430 
some manner it is also contributed by
the<00:02:32.370> fact<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.940> sea<00:02:36.329> views<00:02:36.569> have<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> much

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
the fact that the sea views have a much

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.750 
the fact that the sea views have a much
higher<00:02:38.030> duty<00:02:39.290> compared<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.459> if<00:02:41.640> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
higher duty compared to you know if you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.949 
higher duty compared to you know if you
assemble<00:02:42.180> over

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.280 

well<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.530> ninja<00:02:46.799> 300<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> an<00:02:47.549> all<00:02:47.760> new<00:02:47.939> bike<00:02:48.290> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
well the ninja 300 is an all new bike it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.210 
well the ninja 300 is an all new bike it
does<00:02:49.650> replace<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.610> 250<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.439> actually

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
does replace the 250 but it actually

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.569 
does replace the 250 but it actually
much<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.329> than<00:02:54.569> replaces<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:55.200> 250<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.280> start

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
much more than replaces the 250 to start

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.880 
much more than replaces the 250 to start
with<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.909> is<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> bigger<00:02:57.329> bike<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.709> more

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
with it is a bigger bike it's a more

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.710 
with it is a bigger bike it's a more
powerful<00:02:59.069> bike<00:02:59.549> it<00:03:00.120> has<00:03:00.480> features<00:03:01.409> which<00:03:02.190> are

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
powerful bike it has features which are

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.830 
powerful bike it has features which are
which<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:04.019> been<00:03:05.030> percolated<00:03:06.030> down<00:03:06.060> from<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
which have been percolated down from the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.940 
which have been percolated down from the
larger<00:03:07.290> ninjas<00:03:07.670> d4<00:03:08.670> namely<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.840> 1400<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
larger ninjas d4 namely the 1400 are the

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.460 
larger ninjas d4 namely the 1400 are the
10<00:03:11.159> are<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.609> six<00:03:11.849> are<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.079> is<00:03:13.290> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
10 are the six are so this is a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.690 
10 are the six are so this is a
miniature<00:03:14.459> racing<00:03:15.420> bike<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.769> whereas<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
miniature racing bike and whereas the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.020 
miniature racing bike and whereas the
250<00:03:18.480> was<00:03:18.780> more<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.859> a<00:03:20.040> citibank

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.660 

well<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.520> look<00:03:25.940> at<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:27.370> difference<00:03:28.370> of

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
well if you look at the difference of

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.490 
well if you look at the difference of
the<00:03:28.970> 2<00:03:29.270> 52<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.930> 300<00:03:30.560> in<00:03:30.770> terms<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:32.500> component

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
the 2 52 the 300 in terms of component

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.540 
the 2 52 the 300 in terms of component
performance<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:35.209> actually<00:03:35.720> not<00:03:35.930> much<00:03:36.550> just

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
performance it's actually not much just

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.170 
performance it's actually not much just
about<00:03:37.819> twenty<00:03:38.150> percent<00:03:38.180> yeah<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:40.280> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
about twenty percent yeah it's it's I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.170 
about twenty percent yeah it's it's I
would<00:03:41.450> say<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:41.860> even<00:03:42.860> at<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.430> price<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:44.150> is

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
would say it's even at this price it is

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.420 
would say it's even at this price it is
a<00:03:44.330> very<00:03:44.750> very<00:03:44.930> good<00:03:45.290> value<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.160> very<00:03:46.340> very

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
a very very good value it's a very very

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.820 
a very very good value it's a very very
unique<00:03:46.730> offering<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.480> when<00:03:47.830> somebody

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
unique offering and when somebody

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.050 
unique offering and when somebody
actually<00:03:49.330> writes<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.900> bike<00:03:51.400> open<00:03:52.400> set<00:03:52.640> on<00:03:53.030> a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
actually writes the bike open set on a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.390 
actually writes the bike open set on a
straight<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.230> that's<00:03:54.440> when<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:55.280> know

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
straight and that's when you know

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.190 
straight and that's when you know
somebody<00:03:55.820> will<00:03:56.120> realize<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.480> probably<00:03:57.080> it's

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
somebody will realize that probably it's

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.240 
somebody will realize that probably it's
worth<00:03:57.410> it
