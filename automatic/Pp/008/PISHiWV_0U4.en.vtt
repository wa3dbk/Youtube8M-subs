00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.400
 hi how about how are you friends of 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.590
 perform the tutorials she taught them 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.260
 how to make a very electric motor 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.869
 economic efficient home and with 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.430
 materials very easy to get in 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.080
 this moment they are seeing the project already 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.900
 finished and running so that it 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.419
 encourage them to do it or will see quite 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.839
 fast and it also has a very torque 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.839
 strong 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.180
 with a basic design and not very difficult 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.180
 of doing 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.850
 the materials that I used for 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.789
 carry out this project were a 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.170
 good electrode only the metal rod 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 already clean the coating a tablet 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.359
 a short 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.630
 a small copper tube in a pieces 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:58.020
 a couple of equal manes 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.240
 some copper wire some angles 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 of metal when using them as supports a 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.800
 piece of a metal bar some 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.100
 clips 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 fixed 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.950
 a few small nuts 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 and power supply 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.820
 direct current the first thing is the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.340
 armed the rotor that is the most 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.040
 difficult of our engine the rotor is the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.409
 rotating shaft of our motor is 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.570
 composed by the collector the bar already in 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.250
 bowl and nothing and clear our axis 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.720
 I used the shaft of the rod 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.120
 electrode and louis connector from 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.760
 of the cork and two copper plates that 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.950
 contained from the copper tube 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.630
 cutting it in half by directing the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.580
 another part is the winding that today 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.150
 I leave how to realize it is very important 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.250
 that the cable does not break and that it remains in 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.250
 a single strand so to speak 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.220
 I do not show you photos of each of the 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.980
 steps since you did not think in a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.270
 tutorial of this but stay so happy 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.270
 with the final result 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 now I leave you some other images of 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.379
 our lipstick so they can 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 see different angles look like 5 have 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.850
 destroyed regarding our bar 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.270
 metal as we are cut in on him 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.160
 our state that is the fixed part that 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.770
 will not rotate will be extended to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.870
 button on screen now is 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.760
 constituted from our angles 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.930
 mental of Lugano and note to our 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.180
 plans and about two angles that are going to 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.060
 serve to put our axis in addition to 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.830
 that we're going to put these folded clips 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.470
 so you can connect the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.070
 power supply and those are going to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.350
 touch each of the parts of our 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.340
 collector and so it's going to be like the engine is going 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.340
 to receive the current 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.130
 now that we have our state and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.380
 our rotor we can already assemble our 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.620
 engine 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.780
 or we are going to put the nuts at the end of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.080
 axis so that it does not leave our 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.240
 extractor 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.290
 since with speed it is very likely 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.550
 that starts to vibrate 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.170
 leave your station 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.090
 we have to start the engine 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.090
 putting the bar in vertical 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.260
 you are working 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.890
 It is very important that the pieces of 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.959
 copper I'm very fixed to the cork because 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.170
 at the time of turning and next to the team 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.050
 go flying and a lot of engine goes 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.700
 above 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.680
 and well, good friends, I'll leave you with 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.330
 these videos of the engine finally after seeing 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.000
 some other component more in detail 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.250
 working you can check them 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.530
 sorry for the quality without any what 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.630
 only I had in this moment of equal 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.460
 way if you could assemble this engine if not 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.620
 you could put together the help lists if 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.030
 you have any doubt, you can leave it here 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.560
 in the comments and we will gladly 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.500
 we will respond quickly 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.870
 thanks for reducing this video silvio you 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.250
 liked it 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.900
 it's important to like and subscribe to 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.670
 channel that there may be more videos 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.859
 interesting the intro can be ticket 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.560
 may interest 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:26.460
 this is all to my pair of friends to the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.460
 last installment of 30 tutorials think 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.189
 all right 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.070
 ah 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.830
 ah
