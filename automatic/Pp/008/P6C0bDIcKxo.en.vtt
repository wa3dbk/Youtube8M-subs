00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello everybody 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.580
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 to bask in the vfr before our away game 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 which at the same time the conclusion of a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.490
 English week is ahead of me 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.520
 the brief facts referee 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 partie is an aytekin and we count 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.689
 with about 1400 fans who follow us all 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.820
 accompany 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.310
 all itself assumes that the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 number of spectators on Friday evening at something 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.620
 will be more than 10,000 that from me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 In the first place peter is the same again 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 training after that we start on the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.629
 What are you doing to the players? 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 we will experience that on friday 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.700
 meal yes I have to go I already says 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 strike on strike 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.410
 we have the time after the cup victory 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.530
 give it used in the regenerative 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 training area that is clear it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 There is no intensive training 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.020
 between those two are playing 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.020
 players use them less 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.640
 they are doing more intense work yesterday 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.630
 otherwise this is what we are working on 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.200
 just talk about it all the time 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 very important game is for us 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 that we have that good cup play 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.630
 Of course in the mind should have it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 okay but in further it's just about 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.600
 the encounter in Ahlen 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 It will be a difficult game I mean 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.979
 that the team 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 last year already surprised and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.850
 that you can do it this year 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.000
 he fell further below 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.170
 And I think are some great 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.540
 plays with apprenticeship and is one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.410
 unpleasant opponent waiting us he 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.270
 stÃ¶ger you have now for that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.490
 Pokalspiel a bit raus rotated 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 is there for you because of fitness or because of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.590
 tactics reasons now was too playful 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.590
 rotate 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.340
 So now I do not always know who I am 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.130
 a little hard with it when you get up 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.620
 one or two positions which exchange 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.820
 to speak of rotation 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.770
 It is also his word for that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.000
 It has a rather negative meaning to me 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.070
 always talked about what now 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.770
 correct rotation because it is wrong 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.320
 cool is bad i mean it all 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.030
 normal situation that one on 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.630
 circumstances in the squad on given circumstances 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.470
 the dates of the dates of the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.310
 fitness of the player to pay attention to that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.110
 Coach if you are the fittest and best 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.769
 players for this game in the race 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.739
 can send 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.500
 one can assume that we ourselves 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.709
 have considered with the formation of the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.070
 really have sent my field and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.900
 But we also said that we the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.760
 one or two players are very 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.110
 also deserved to play but out 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.450
 that is, different ones can be used 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.790
 who come back to play something 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.230
 again, that means if we are like that 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.060
 want to be rotating again on the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.610
 one or the other position but for 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.780
 me is the normal situation that one 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.140
 20 players in the kart and if two outside 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.239
 are then two new players but come 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.280
 see real rotation again if the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.230
 possibility is seven eight nine 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.420
 players because they already 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.420
 given that will hardly exist with us
