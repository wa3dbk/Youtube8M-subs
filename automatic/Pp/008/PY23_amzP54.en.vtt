00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:51.050
 today is May 15 yesterday it was hot 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.530
 of 41 degrees almost dehydrated 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 you had to water the geniuses 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.809
 good but the reason to choose me 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 we are to indicate that there is a video already 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 I will tell you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.270
 looking for I will look for you to look at it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 date on which 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 um and by contact 3 adn is that what 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.520
 now I'm going to analyze to see the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 conclusion of s 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.190
 Here I present what I said in the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 introduction 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.659
 this time I'm just going to talk 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.390
 of the DNA that the two converse 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.270
 stool 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.880
 instead of being s they are 22 because they were 6 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.200
 How beautiful they are now, it looks a little 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.110
 2 because only 2 were joined 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.440
 third 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.170
 I had to get rid of him because I do not take 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.360
 in contact kisses and usually appears 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.800
 the other but let's analyze 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 We have one that, as you can see, has a cut 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.380
 the apex at the time 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.660
 you have to always cut it 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.970
 if we turn around 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.000
 we found the other beige 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.250
 I also have it without apex 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 because next we get another 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.490
 and there is a little competition because 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 this branch is 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.690
 forcing a bit and as you see 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.350
 if I 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.990
 I bring you blind you will no longer force it 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.770
 will force leis no longer force us but as 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.300
 there is still a little difficulty you see 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.690
 other 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:03.630
 there we have another cut to produce the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.950
 foliage that is the end out the factory 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.970
 of the plant 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.410
 it's all this year I do not think that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.820
 flourish 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.700
 because they have had work there in addition 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.350
 these have suffered a lot there we have the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.350
 contact at the time 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.180
 and 5 t 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 in the other other cut 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.620
 and what happened then nothing they themselves have 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.100
 regenerated and have created other epidermis 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.090
 they have created 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.550
 another type d 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.630
 you see here they ask differently to this other 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.890
 return amen 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.610
 have created values that I'm going to bring a 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.610
 little more to chÃ¡vez 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:04.910
 you see how they have created that type that is 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.950
 those stripes are the same as these 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.380
 Well, having got a thread and they 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.700
 have generated is he 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.980
 they join to avoid the entry of 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.470
 pathogens are elements 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.280
 difficult pathogen is what 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.790
 it hurts everything 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.620
 the living element if we turn around 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.920
 bringing here there has been another attempt 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.150
 approach but it closes 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.090
 because there was no 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.810
 the right contact let's continue 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.580
 seeing and there they are there they are there you see 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.870
 how they have come together 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:56.000
 a cut and the cuts are seen 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:59.909
 perpendicular and here right here I had 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.240
 it's right here among them here I had 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:07.599
 the other as not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.150
 It came to be formed by contact 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.569
 so I had to give up but now 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:19.260
 it's a success and I encourage you to do it 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:22.590
 because there we will have a pretty coudet 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.870
 pretty good nice to say yes 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.940
 we had here three together imagine 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.230
 what a beautiful thing 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.900
 soon what I will do will be this 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.900
 this one that's here to cut it so that 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.420
 do not put pressure on the other and 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.510
 then let them freely follow 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.300
 working 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.590
 that is the conclusion 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.990
 you see there how they have stuck 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.470
 perfectly in the innermost part and 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.509
 it is already sent from everywhere 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.129
 Well, you are seeing all the cuts 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:06.539
 all no more than 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.539
 explain is to encourage 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.930
 and that you experiment with them 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:16.810
 it is possible that well 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:24.700
 here you see it 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:29.360
 in the background I have the greenhouse that 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.480
 is open and what 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.680
 we will see later 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.680
 later 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.040
 Y
