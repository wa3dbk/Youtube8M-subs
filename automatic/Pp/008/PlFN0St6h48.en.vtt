in your deck drawing into your volcanic

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
in your deck drawing into your volcanic
rockets<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.260> its<00:00:34.559> second<00:00:34.980> effect<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
rockets and its second effect is that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you can banish it from your grave to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.979 
you can banish it from your grave to
send<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.430> volcanic<00:00:38.969> card<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.690> deck<00:00:39.750> to

send a volcanic card from your deck to
the<00:00:40.140> grave<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.890> send<00:00:41.250> scatter<00:00:41.940> shots

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the grave so you can send scatter shots

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
the grave so you can send scatter shots
or<00:00:42.570> volcanic<00:00:43.110> shell<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.710> example<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
or volcanic shell for example to your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.639 
or volcanic shell for example to your
grave<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.930> something<00:00:46.140> important<00:00:46.590> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
grave and also something important is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.630 
grave and also something important is
that<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.980> use<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> during<00:00:47.430> your

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that you can use it during your

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
example scattershot romantic through

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
example scattershot romantic through
grave<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.770> get<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.280> Jackie<00:00:53.670> effect

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
yes something not to overlook yeah

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
yes something not to overlook yeah
anyway<00:00:58.680> let's<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.190> tools<00:01:00.710> okay<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> had<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
anyway let's see some tools okay I had a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
anyway let's see some tools okay I had a
lot<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.850> rules<00:01:03.090> against<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.629> Forte's<00:01:03.960> these

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
lot of rules against my Forte's these

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
lot of rules against my Forte's these
words<00:01:04.769> yeah<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.250> were<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> more

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
words yeah these were the more

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.200 
words yeah these were the more
interesting<00:01:06.869> ones<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.909> we<00:01:08.909> don't

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
interesting ones because we we don't

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
interesting ones because we we don't
want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> OT<00:01:10.470> case<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.130> obviously

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
want to see the OT case it's obviously

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.690 
want to see the OT case it's obviously
it's<00:01:11.939> obvious<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> Clive<00:01:13.080> forts<00:01:13.500> are

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's obvious that that Clive forts are

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's obvious that that Clive forts are
insanely<00:01:14.700> better<00:01:15.270> than<00:01:15.570> volcanic<00:01:16.189> but<00:01:17.189> these

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
insanely better than volcanic but these

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
insanely better than volcanic but these
were<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.390> interesting<00:01:19.080> though<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.530> no

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
were the more interesting though so no

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.219 
were the more interesting though so no
tools<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.000> last<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.540> three<00:01:21.750> turns

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
tools that that last like three turns

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.980 
tools that that last like three turns
and<00:01:22.680> work<00:01:22.890> life<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.610> otk<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> champion

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and work life or otk is like a champion

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.910 
and work life or otk is like a champion
yet<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.159> that's<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.700> fun<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.090> watch<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
yet that's that's not fun to watch right

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
yet that's that's not fun to watch right
so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> more<00:01:29.430> interesting<00:01:29.970> ones<00:01:30.049> go<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
so I do the more interesting ones go to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
so I do the more interesting ones go to
MST<00:01:31.530> stool<00:01:31.950> obviously<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> flip<00:01:32.909> over<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
MST stool obviously and flip over to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
MST stool obviously and flip over to
magazines<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> discard<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
magazines as I can discard to the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.819 
magazines as I can discard to the
counter<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:37.049> forced<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> burn

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
counter but I think I'm forced to burn

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.069 
counter but I think I'm forced to burn
it<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.640> super<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> counter<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it here I'm for super the counter on the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.999 
it here I'm for super the counter on the
wing<00:01:40.259> blast<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> there's<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.200> still<00:01:43.649> don't<00:01:43.890> have

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
wing blast so there's I still don't have

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.700 
wing blast so there's I still don't have
any<00:01:44.189> targets<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.930> explained<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:45.960> built<00:01:46.409> from

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
any targets I explained my built from

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.819 
any targets I explained my built from
from<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> few<00:01:47.880> am<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.689> my<00:01:48.780> last<00:01:49.140> cross<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
from a few am for my last cross from a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280

battle ice yet at suicide with the the
hands<00:03:12.879> with<00:03:13.030> ice<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.599> that's<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
hands with ice and so that's one of the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.449 
hands with ice and so that's one of the
reasons<00:03:14.319> why<00:03:14.409> i<00:03:14.440> still<00:03:14.769> playing<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.099> your

reasons why i still playing the your

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.460 
reasons why i still playing the your

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
hands in the main deck because they can

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
hands in the main deck because they can
nicely<00:03:17.769> put<00:03:18.159> pressure<00:03:18.579> on<00:03:18.909> your<00:03:19.030> opponent

was<00:03:34.540> ok<00:03:34.930> I'm<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.379> activate<00:03:35.560> ability<00:03:36.190> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
was ok I'm going to activate ability and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.240 
was ok I'm going to activate ability and
hopefully<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.239> can<00:03:37.419> reveal<00:03:38.199> a<00:03:38.260> scattershot<00:03:38.859> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
hopefully I can reveal a scattershot so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250 
hopefully I can reveal a scattershot so
I<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.579> burn<00:03:39.970> them<00:03:40.449> to<00:03:40.479> death<00:03:41.139> and<00:03:41.409> I<00:03:42.190> do<00:03:43.260> so

1900<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:03.410> I'm<00:05:03.530> going<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.770> chain<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.310> ring

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
1900 so I'm going to chain the ring
