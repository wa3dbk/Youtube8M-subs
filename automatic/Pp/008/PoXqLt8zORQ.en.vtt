00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
what's up with this game I basically

think<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.130> suppression<00:02:21.580> fire<00:02:22.000> really

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
think that the suppression fire really

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.610 
think that the suppression fire really
killed<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.110> game<00:02:23.880> because<00:02:24.880> why<00:02:25.810> why<00:02:26.319> do<00:02:26.380> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
killed that game because why why do you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.559 
killed that game because why why do you
have<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.220> blurry<00:02:27.610> because<00:02:27.940> someone
