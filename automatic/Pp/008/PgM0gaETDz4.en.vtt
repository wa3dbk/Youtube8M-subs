for the price I tell you all the specs

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.710 
for the price I tell you all the specs
about<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:07.939> here<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.000> some<00:01:09.180> comments<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
about it and here are some comments and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
about it and here are some comments and
this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> version<00:01:10.260> -<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.040> which<00:01:11.700> no<00:01:11.880> one

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this is the version - so which no one

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050 
this is the version - so which no one
probably<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:13.610> successful<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:14.909> why

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
probably was successful and that's why

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.700 
probably was successful and that's why
they<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:16.670> they<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:18.000> another<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
they now they have another one out but I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
they now they have another one out but I
was<00:01:22.710> watching<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.570> cannot<00:01:24.570> plug<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.990> here

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
was watching well I cannot plug in here

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.480 
was watching well I cannot plug in here
and<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> front<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.100> four<00:01:27.590> USB<00:01:28.590> 2.0

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and at the front you have four USB 2.0

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.710 
and at the front you have four USB 2.0
so<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> back<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.049> happen<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.740> 3.0<00:01:32.729> USB<00:01:32.909> 2

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so at the back you happen to 3.0 USB 2

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.390 
so at the back you happen to 3.0 USB 2
more<00:01:34.430> 2.0<00:01:35.430> USB<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:37.049> looks<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> video

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
more 2.0 USB it looks like as the video

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.040 
more 2.0 USB it looks like as the video
I<00:01:41.060> know<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.240> this

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
I know what this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.950 
I know what this
that<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.500> dmin<00:01:45.220> decide<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.420> Ethernet

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
that is dmin decide to Ethernet

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.160 
that is dmin decide to Ethernet
connections<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:49.330> think<00:01:49.510> these<00:01:49.990> are

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
connections and I just think these are

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.500 
connections and I just think these are
also<00:01:50.350> another<00:01:50.650> type<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.370> connection<00:01:51.820> maybe<00:01:53.250> TV

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
also another type of connection maybe TV

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.680 
also another type of connection maybe TV
for<00:01:55.510> our<00:01:55.600> television<00:01:55.870> car<00:01:56.380> no<00:01:56.770> really<00:01:57.730> guys

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
for our television car no really guys

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.110 
for our television car no really guys
TVs<00:01:59.500> or<00:01:59.830> computers<00:02:00.370> monitors<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.960> HDMI<00:02:03.120> so

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
TVs or computers monitors the HDMI so

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.670 
TVs or computers monitors the HDMI so
you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.360> plug<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.720> into<00:02:04.870> anything<00:02:05.170> pretty

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
you can plug it into anything pretty

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.359 
you can plug it into anything pretty
much

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.980 

and<00:02:09.369> then<00:02:09.490> I'll<00:02:09.640> say<00:02:09.850> what<00:02:10.270> are<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> specs<00:02:10.750> on

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and then I'll say what are the specs on

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.610 
and then I'll say what are the specs on

right yeah I'm guessing you could sue
row<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:58.150> kit<00:02:58.600> or<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.940> even<00:03:01.150> get<00:03:01.590> Ubuntu<00:03:02.590> in

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
row up kit or or even get Ubuntu in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.479 
row up kit or or even get Ubuntu in
there<00:03:03.670> if<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.090> wanna<00:03:04.330> Lubuntu<00:03:05.110> maybe<00:03:05.489> or

there if you wanna Lubuntu maybe or

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.470 
there if you wanna Lubuntu maybe or
debian<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.270> not<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:09.160> just<00:03:09.459> something<00:03:10.450> that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
debian or not it's just something that

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.750
