 17652 I do quite well 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:36.300
 The price is cheaper than the 6 mother of the max team somehow. 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.100

 This 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.790
 Sound sounds onboard seem pretty good 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.840
 In a supreme fx 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.840
 What is it that strengthens 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.220
 That Nde net Langer fast after yet 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.390
 It seems that it is being used for the game somehow because it is provided by age 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.090
 That's right, zq 7 pro is written, but who has no gamer z 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 97 professional person 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 There is usually a fever, but that is the power phase with a certainty here but it was certainly 12 + 3 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:28.159
 Here is the overclocking for at why the far over there of the bell power supply phase to sleep 8+ 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 When z 97 to a professional is usually also high gold price in the direction of is there is more of over there Nema 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.090
 Best name for Maxim 's overclocking is great 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.090
 Let's bite the race I don't get Kim 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:48.120
 Each good and good body is left 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.820
 This is not a wallet Louis snake wallet This is a back panel etc. Yes This is standing 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.470
 Here it is the user manual 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.770
 Well already 5 me but the driver disk cd Well of the same eye er suit people logo sticker 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.090
 Ah 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:06.290
 Well, here is the main explanation of some of them. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:11.290
 aca ぶ り い 子 子 and sata cables are 4 sounds 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.290
 I'm good at it after all 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.320
 Let's go back 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.840
 It became inexpensive strong 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.290
 Thunderbird with lyrics I have with fields that static electricity Well big 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.829
 It is tentatively attention I'd do not have that memory any static electricity 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.730
 This will not do that say it Well gaming has become a gaming mother 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.100
 but 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.830
 It's cool, is n't it ? 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:41.590
 Well it looks cool as a whole, but like gaming 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:46.360
 It's kind of a heat sink around here or something about this one 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.870
 It feels like this, but it feels like it's such a cool feeling that it stopped for a moment in red and black 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.110
 I will 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.850
 In're using memo Re is now I'd like a here that black east Kinki yellow 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.620
 It is unified here in Guro-ku, but a little grape 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:08.030
 If it is better to say that this time of day is love, this end is 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:12.140
 Yes, the number of sockets is right here in 884, but it's 4 days later 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.810
 I do not putamen of have to was in with what I'd have thought me there I wonder if somewhere 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.170
 But I don't understand it a little 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:23.500
 With the expansion slot is that 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:28.230
 Here's a pci 3.0 3.0 This is a pti express 163.0 Kana 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.680
 In wonder what this is kana 2.0 pci 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.890
 Household budget 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.730
 Port not some have fewer Kana support to I'm myself not many and I'm useless r 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.510
 Lots of obscene dragon 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.500
 Something says to be due 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:49.110
 There is a small image here on the open side 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.110
 usb and you or I usb port 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.510
 It is seven treasures six ports 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.500
 Are you using yourself now ? 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.930
 After this, I wonder what this is or pso 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:08.040
 p device forgot US light digital hdmi d sub dvi 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.170
 Four usb 3.0 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.159
 Or what his or her library is all usb 3.0 was was seems I in here is the gaming and crab 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.460
 Optimal 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.220
 Intel 's 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.350
 Gigabit lan 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.590
 It's red. Audio This is good. 9 This 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.420
 But I cut off the camera again 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.720
 Here 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:35.370
 supreme fx is whether I of here 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:41.969
 It seems pretty sound is good even in this thanks to a ne onboard 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.800
 It seems like there is no other cpu socket 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:49.539
 sata port is here ah 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.610
 I only have 12 c 66 ports 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:56.160
 How many hard disks do you have on 6 ports ? 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.110
 Perhaps 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.840
 I think I can not accept what is the dvd effort 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.710
 Is it okay ? 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.180
 Oh here two 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:14.620
 There are no minutes of US and US on this day. 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.430
 Well, it 's normal for oc, but it's timothy 4.5 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.790
 I 'm using all the plus I have now 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.860
 Oh my mother is like this 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.900
 Oh dear 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.790
 It's a normal massage state 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:32.580
 It is Well appearance to thank the gaming so 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:38.569
 Well , compared to what I say z 97 Deluxe 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:44.899
 Well it's not deluxe, so I feel that the heat bride's home is already cool 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.550
 In this socket after this it is not and processor splashes when it returns or repairs this 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:54.399
 It can not be returned without it 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.399
 This is one of the problems I have to leave absolutely like this because it is only a fungus or repair 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.840
 I thought one more thing 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.249
 suit 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:06.280
 Well then 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:08.260
 This power supply and this hard disk access lamp and this 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.940
 somehow 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.820
 I connector is the part or did not like was what side of the past the past that can be this easy 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.990
 It was no longer 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.090
 It's not a gaming model, so I say it is supposed to be detained 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:27.070
 Oh well wonder if feeling the 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.100
 Well this is mustard in Well performance Nde this for the time being it looks like Gaming 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.200
 Oh dear 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:35.660
 Responsible for whether the game of processing on how the back'm never used Toka that the he or she entertainer bran mother 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.620
 If you want gpu and cpu why 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.270
 So the frame rate etc. 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:47.100
 It will not be taboo 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:49.200
 If it says that it changes at best , how much is it with this and this gigabit of net after 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.889
 It is a problem that ping is stable 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.159
 Pin is considered important in net games and so on 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.910
 Pinger also do become higher lager 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.980
 There are more lags 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:04.480
 It called the Su Shirakawa 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.850
 Well this is the fruit of this fruit hi na this time z 97 pro 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:13.440
 I opened the gamer Well installation etc 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.440
 Water data is that kind that I think let's do Kana maybe Well can be under
