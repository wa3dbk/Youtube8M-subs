00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 demons god i am crc and we are in a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.770
 new pokemon video that will make 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.380
 our worst nightmares go to the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 light and maybe you can not sleep we are in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.460
 the most horrendous letters of pokemon 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 surely we all have a letter 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.090
 favorite or one that we think is 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 very pretty that has a very cool design 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 and that I love but there's also 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.449
 opposite letters that are aberration 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.670
 of humanity and that there should not be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.080
 never existed and they should not see the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.580
 light in this video I will make a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 compilation of the worst letters that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 I come to find this world by 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 this planet earth and for all that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 you want in video the first 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.219
 letter visit slow king baptized as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 the slow king drug dealer I think 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 what about the words with this face that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.219
 does this pokemon really look like 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.530
 he's in for the body a lot and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 enough bad thing is enough and has a face 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.539
 say children come to me in plan 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.640
 Jesus Christ or in plan and it's not really 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 going the stalker and now he's looking at 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.149
 drug seller really this letter 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.219
 it has left me fascinated good to me 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.239
 Grace does not know about you but the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.330
 it's true that he's very curious so 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.300
 well we already have there not in the thing 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.920
 and to slow king the drug dealer in the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.200
 second letter we have focus band 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.270
 baptized as the constipated male 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 really this letter is made for the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
 focus band which is that object that already 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.790
 you all know that we already know everything without 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 But note that had male 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.440
 he has that focus band that seems 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.240
 really constipated is really 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.700
 making an effort to smile and for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.730
 look good in this photo and could not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.280
 endure what has been the call 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.680
 of nature in this letter more than 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.479
 the object they want to announce calls more 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.760
 the attention the pokemon but good we go 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.190
 to leave it there and let's leave macho 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.100
 doing their little things the third letter 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.260
 highlight is slow king made with paint 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.080
 if you are and do not think that this is a fake 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.760
 because it is not, it's an official letter that 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.590
 I know it's really a special letter 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.680
 that was distributed in the corocoro of 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.180
 September 1999 that was baptized 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.460
 as hamas although it is the nickname of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.619
 masatoshi hamada who was in charge of 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.660
 put the voice to slow king of the movie 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.190
 of pokemon the power of one and this was the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.700
 design that he did that is a design 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.770
 official for this letter 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.110
 really like a tribute to hamada 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.700
 even if I go with the drawing to 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.950
 then he left us a few more 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.390
 creations of tomo coffee as it is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.709
 the same creator as the previous ones 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.720
 letters that you have seen below 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.879
 you are seeing all these that everyone 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 It has more fabric than the previous one 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.540
 all that onÃ­s that is sheltering from 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.790
 the rain with a retarder face that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.400
 can not with her and that shot that with 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.019
 face as it weighs kill me to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.330
 expensive but good let's leave it there 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.129
 We will continue advancing what you are 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.590
 watching below is mole 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.700
 following plasticine dolls like 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.280
 you are seeing what they have done has been 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.650
 transform adif or into pokÃ©mons that already 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 exist by putting your own face on it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.920
 say that give a little bit of fear about 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.900
 everything mister magic that already mister may 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.640
 in case it is not very reliable I do not trust 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.569
 much of mister main and on top of putting 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.130
 the face of tito 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.560
 forget that I catch it that pokemon 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.590
 the further the better the next 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.750
 letter highlight is electro the bug eats 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.640
 children as you are seeing what fits 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.160
 highlight this pokemon is this look 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.750
 terrifying and those giant teeth that 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.890
 it looks like it's going to rip your head off 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 a bite 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.209
 apart, the most shocking thing of all is that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.030
 it looks like it's flying on the letter 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.650
 from when electro can fly if not 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.440
 can not be separated a millimeter from 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.390
 So this letter is terrifying and not 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640
 should have come to light ever 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.250
 I see this pokemon down the street and I 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.080
 Fainting is already the next letter is the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.209
 is nor drawn by children of 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.860
 primary the name of this letter I believe 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.390
 that you will understand all because it is because 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.950
 surely that you little ones 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.200
 you have made a drawing and it has come out 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.970
 something like this really there is no 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.709
 to do a lot to make this 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.930
 drawing you can do four scribbles and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.459
 that you get this really the great thing about 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.230
 this letter is that a contest was made 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.120
 for the design of this promotional letter 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.280
 of standards and this was the winning design 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.890
 therefore imagine what the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.269
 other designs actually it seems fine 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.980
 who have put this design because you 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.140
 all to see what they have come to do 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.180
 the other people another of the letters 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.980
 that is worth noting is this male doing 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.350
 juggle to the delight of your audience 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.019
 as you are watching there is a duo a bolton 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.640
 a lemon chan and so on that match am 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.900
 he looks a little overwhelmed and a little tired 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.180
 but everything is for pride 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.560
 the happiness of your audience and good

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.310

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.229

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.000
