00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
done this myself because about six

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.720 
done this myself because about six
months<00:00:12.420> ago<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:13.049> horrified<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:14.040> look<00:00:14.610> in

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
months ago I was horrified to look in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
months ago I was horrified to look in
the<00:00:14.820> mirror<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.780> had<00:00:16.260> something

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the mirror and see I had something

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.160 
the mirror and see I had something
forming<00:00:17.369> rather<00:00:18.090> similar<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.840> what<00:00:19.020> this

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
forming rather similar to what this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.830 
forming rather similar to what this
lady's<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.430> mean<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.510> certainly

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
lady's got here I mean it certainly

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480 
lady's got here I mean it certainly
wasn't<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.380> bad<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> only<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.460> my

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
wasn't that bad because I'm only in my

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
wasn't that bad because I'm only in my
forties<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.570> definitely<00:00:24.840> there<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
forties but it was definitely there and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
forties but it was definitely there and
if<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.859> hadn't<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.189> done<00:00:26.400> anything<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.170> think

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
if I hadn't have done anything I think

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.580 
if I hadn't have done anything I think
you'd<00:00:28.590> find<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:30.510> gets<00:00:30.840> worse<00:00:31.140> quite

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you'd find that it gets worse quite

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
you'd find that it gets worse quite
quickly<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.399> noticed<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> friend<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

enough fifties and okay it's probably

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
enough fifties and okay it's probably
not<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> bad<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.790> far<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.969> I'm

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
think every day is necessary I aim for

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.779 
think every day is necessary I aim for
five<00:00:59.879> or<00:00:59.940> six<00:01:00.390> days<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> week<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.829> minimum<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
five or six days a week so a minimum of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.130 
five or six days a week so a minimum of
five<00:01:03.059> days<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:03.870> say<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:07.490> firstly<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
five days I would say so firstly this is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890

direction now I say 10 because I'm

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.040 
direction now I say 10 because I'm
assuming<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.450> you're<00:04:30.570> going<00:04:30.660> to<00:04:30.720> be<00:04:30.780> able<00:04:30.900> to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
assuming that you're going to be able to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.600 
assuming that you're going to be able to
start<00:04:31.260> with<00:04:31.440> 10<00:04:31.680> which<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.980> probably<00:04:32.220> won't

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
start with 10 which you probably won't

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.180 
start with 10 which you probably won't
so<00:04:32.970> if<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.390> start<00:04:33.690> with<00:04:33.900> six<00:04:34.290> heads<00:04:34.680> up<00:04:34.980> and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
so if you start with six heads up and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.490 
so if you start with six heads up and
down<00:04:35.400> then<00:04:36.300> do<00:04:38.270> 62<00:04:39.270> up<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.810> side<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.350> it's

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
down then do 62 up to the side so it's

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.840 
down then do 62 up to the side so it's
three<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:40.830> one<00:04:40.950> direction<00:04:41.130> three<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:41.760> the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
three in one direction three and the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.910 
three in one direction three and the
other<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.630> start<00:04:42.900> with<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.050> heads<00:04:43.500> up<00:04:43.770> and

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
other if you start with a heads up and

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.730 
other if you start with a heads up and
down<00:04:44.130> start<00:04:44.940> with<00:04:45.090> foreign<00:04:45.600> for<00:04:46.170> heads<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
down start with foreign for heads to the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.710 
down start with foreign for heads to the
side<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.310> hope<00:04:47.730> that's<00:04:47.880> clear<00:04:48.240> because<00:04:48.450> it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
side I hope that's clear because it's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.050 
side I hope that's clear because it's
not<00:04:48.990> very<00:04:49.440> well<00:04:49.710> explained<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.370> I'm<00:04:50.700> going<00:04:51.000> to

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
not very well explained but I'm going to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.010 
not very well explained but I'm going to
put<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> link<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.260> end<00:04:52.380> of<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.860> video<00:04:53.130> so

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
put a link at the end of this video so

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.660 
put a link at the end of this video so
where<00:04:55.020> you'll<00:04:55.200> see<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> web<00:04:56.040> page<00:04:56.250> when<00:04:56.580> it's

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
where you'll see a web page when it's

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.540 
where you'll see a web page when it's
better<00:04:56.880> explain<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:58.200> just<00:04:58.440> do<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.890> for<00:04:59.130> 30

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
better explain and just do that for 30

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.400 
better explain and just do that for 30
days<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.300> combination<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:01.140> these<00:05:01.350> two

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
days a combination of these two

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.070 
days a combination of these two
exercises<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.970> promise<00:05:03.390> you<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.930> your

exercises and I promise you that your

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.960 
exercises and I promise you that your
double<00:05:04.440> chin<00:05:04.650> will<00:05:05.460> be<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.670> thing<00:05:05.970> of<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.300> past
