what I've got here is I've got a piece

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.429 
what I've got here is I've got a piece
of<00:00:20.100> tech<00:00:20.640> news<00:00:20.850> paper<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.510> cut<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
of tech news paper so I can cut this and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
of tech news paper so I can cut this and
I<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.340> I'll<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.490> cut<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.150> straight<00:00:26.359> then

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I think I'll just cut it straight then

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
I think I'll just cut it straight then

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
grout is because that's one of the most

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.719 
grout is because that's one of the most

before what we're going to do is get the
bottom<00:01:08.520> page<00:01:08.939> started<00:01:09.570> first<00:01:12.799> get<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> bottom

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
bottom page started first get the bottom

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.060 
bottom page started first get the bottom
piece<00:01:14.520> started<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.860> most

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
piece started first but the most

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
piece started first but the most
critical<00:01:17.310> part<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.200> corner

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
critical part is right in the corner

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.980 
critical part is right in the corner
this<00:01:20.220> outside<00:01:20.820> bottom<00:01:21.330> piece<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.900> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this outside bottom piece we're going to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
this outside bottom piece we're going to
bend<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> comes<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> nice

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
bend it so it comes right into a nice

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.780 
bend it so it comes right into a nice
point<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.490> we're<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.729> to

point like that and then we're going to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
point like that and then we're going to
press<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> grout<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
press that right on to the grout in that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.810 
press that right on to the grout in that
corner<00:01:29.750> really<00:01:30.750> nice<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.290> tightly<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:32.520> what

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
I'm going to do is bend this so that it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
I'm going to do is bend this so that it
curves<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> wanted<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> then

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
curves in the way I wanted and then

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.889

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
press it down go to the stink bend in it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
press it down go to the stink bend in it
as<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> wall<00:01:46.009> press<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> into

as I go up the wall press it into

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.270 
as I go up the wall press it into
position<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.930> before<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.979> here

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
position and then before I get up here

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.260 
position and then before I get up here
I'm<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.180> come<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
I'm going to have that come out of it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.160 
I'm going to have that come out of it
but<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> want<00:01:54.630> curve<00:01:55.320> out<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.610> bit

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
but I want curve out just a little bit

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
but I want curve out just a little bit
so<00:01:58.170> catch<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.920> water<00:01:59.219> when<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> pour<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so catch more water when I pour the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.660 
so catch more water when I pour the
water<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.930> through<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.460> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
water down through there see if I can

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:14.740 
water down through there see if I can
zoom<00:02:02.939> in

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.650 

so<00:02:15.750> i<00:02:15.780> got<00:02:16.050> my<00:02:16.110> distinct<00:02:16.830> curve<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.850> from

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
so i got my distinct curve on there from

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.590 
so i got my distinct curve on there from
this<00:02:18.870> side<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
this side you can see that it's got a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.170 
this side you can see that it's got a
curve<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.560> as<00:02:22.920> i<00:02:23.040> said<00:02:23.100> i<00:02:23.520> wanted<00:02:23.910> i

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
curve of it and as i said i wanted i

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.870 
curve of it and as i said i wanted i
could<00:02:24.360> bend<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.780> really<00:02:25.290> hard<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> any

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
could bend that really hard so that any

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.910 
could bend that really hard so that any
water<00:02:27.240> would<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:27.930> definitely<00:02:28.410> flow<00:02:28.650> back

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
water would would definitely flow back

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.790 
water would would definitely flow back
into<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.400> tub<00:02:29.640> my<00:02:30.480> corner<00:02:30.930> meets<00:02:31.140> perfectly

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
into the tub my corner meets perfectly

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.090 
into the tub my corner meets perfectly
there<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> were<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:33.690> far<00:02:33.960> out<00:02:34.100> one

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
there but if it were really far out one

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.510 
there but if it were really far out one
put<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> piece<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.940> tape<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.740> use

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
put a piece of tape in there or to use

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.180 
put a piece of tape in there or to use
the<00:02:38.760> glue<00:02:38.970> gun<00:02:39.210> on<00:02:39.450> there<00:02:39.720> or<00:02:39.900> three<00:02:40.860> maybe

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the glue gun on there or three maybe

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.220 
the glue gun on there or three maybe
maybe<00:02:41.970> we'll<00:02:42.210> put<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.960> vote

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
maybe we'll put this up to a vote

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.550 
maybe we'll put this up to a vote
instead<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.800> me<00:02:43.950> making<00:02:44.250> these<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:44.910> 90<00:02:45.450> degrees

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
instead of me making these at 90 degrees

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.460 
instead of me making these at 90 degrees
or<00:02:46.560> two<00:02:46.920> 45s<00:02:47.520> let's<00:02:48.270> say<00:02:48.480> make<00:02:48.690> each<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.350> them

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
or two 45s let's say make each of them

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.770 
or two 45s let's say make each of them
at<00:02:49.650> 40<00:02:50.010> degrees<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.730> it'll<00:02:51.450> definitely

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
at 40 degrees so that it'll definitely

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.320 
at 40 degrees so that it'll definitely
this<00:02:52.440> one<00:02:52.680> will<00:02:52.890> definitely<00:02:53.400> overlap<00:02:53.940> this

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
this one will definitely overlap this

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.450 
this one will definitely overlap this
one<00:02:54.570> will<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.380> put<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.740> up<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> vote

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
one will have to put that up to a vote

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.660 
one will have to put that up to a vote
and<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:57.090> how<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> goes
