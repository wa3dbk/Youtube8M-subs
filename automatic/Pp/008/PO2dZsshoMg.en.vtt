really<00:00:23.089> a<00:00:23.119> recipe<00:00:23.419> and<00:00:24.230> there<00:00:25.039> are<00:00:25.130> five

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
really a recipe and there are five

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.399 
really a recipe and there are five
ingredients<00:00:26.089> to<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:26.239> recipe<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.900> first<00:00:27.079> one

ingredients to that recipe the first one

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.319 
ingredients to that recipe the first one
and<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:27.619> most<00:00:27.650> important<00:00:28.249> one<00:00:28.400> is<00:00:28.579> leadership

and that leadership is very very

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.910 
and that leadership is very very
important<00:00:32.570> especially<00:00:32.660> since<00:00:33.440> it's<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.680> kind

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
important especially since it's the kind

power and other people in the building

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.140 
power and other people in the building
it's<00:00:39.650> not<00:00:39.830> just<00:00:40.100> all<00:00:40.310> residing<00:00:40.940> with<00:00:41.060> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.650 
of the ingredients out your school won't
improve<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.100> they've<00:01:38.310> studied<00:01:38.660> schools

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
improve and so they've studied schools

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.900 
improve and so they've studied schools
of<00:01:39.810> Chicago<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.440> compared<00:01:40.860> ones<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.789> have

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
of Chicago and compared ones that have

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.150 
of Chicago and compared ones that have
improved<00:01:42.179> to<00:01:42.810> ones<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.080> haven't<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.800> they

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
improved to ones that haven't and they

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.380 
improved to ones that haven't and they
see<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.550> these<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.910> five<00:01:45.179> ingredients

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
see that these are the five ingredients

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.350 
see that these are the five ingredients
that<00:01:45.929> make<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.890> most<00:01:47.009> difference<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> have

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that make the most difference now I have

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.150 
that make the most difference now I have
to<00:01:48.539> smile<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.259> research<00:01:49.770> came<00:01:50.009> out

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
to smile when that research came out

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.249 
to smile when that research came out
because<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:50.940> my<00:01:51.149> presentations<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.929> use

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because when I do my presentations I use

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.100 
because when I do my presentations I use
an<00:01:52.470> analogy<00:01:52.679> of<00:01:53.130> cakes<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.820> recipes<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> what

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
an analogy of cakes and recipes and what

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
an analogy of cakes and recipes and what
I've<00:01:55.200> said<00:01:55.470> over<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.800> years<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> when

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
I've said over the years is that when

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.230 
I've said over the years is that when
you<00:01:57.300> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> cake<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.820> looking<00:02:00.090> at

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you look at a cake and you're looking at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.029 
you look at a cake and you're looking at
the<00:02:00.360> ingredients<00:02:00.899> from<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.080> cake<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.679> flour

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
the ingredients from the cake the flour

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.310 
the ingredients from the cake the flour
is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.179> has<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.360> most<00:02:03.509> volume<00:02:03.960> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
is the one that has the most volume so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.990 
is the one that has the most volume so
we're<00:02:04.500> using<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:05.009> two<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.369> three<00:02:05.399> cup<00:02:05.759> cups

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
we're using maybe two or three cup cups

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.139 
we're using maybe two or three cup cups
of<00:02:06.179> flour<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.289> cake<00:02:07.590> recipe<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.880> really

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of flour to a cake recipe and I really

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.560 
of flour to a cake recipe and I really
look<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.630> as<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> our<00:02:10.739> our<00:02:11.160> staff

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
look at that as you know our our staff

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.819 
look at that as you know our our staff
because<00:02:12.570> when<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.989> look<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.260> any<00:02:13.440> school

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
because when you look at any school

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.190 
because when you look at any school
budget<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.489> resources<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:15.360> personnel<00:02:15.930> is

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
budget the resources for personnel is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.890 
budget the resources for personnel is
usually<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.940> know<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.360> highest<00:02:18.720> proportion

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
usually you know the highest proportion

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720 
usually you know the highest proportion
of<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.470> resources<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.220> terms<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.519> what<00:02:20.640> we

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
of the resources in terms of what we

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.120 
of the resources in terms of what we
spend<00:02:20.850> our<00:02:21.060> funding<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.739> when<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.950> look

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
spend our funding on but when you look

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.740 
spend our funding on but when you look
at<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> cake<00:02:23.489> recipe<00:02:23.640> there's<00:02:24.060> also<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.390> main

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
at a cake recipe there's also a main

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.170 
at a cake recipe there's also a main
ingredient<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.799> leave<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.400> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
ingredient that if you leave it out you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.110 
ingredient that if you leave it out you
have<00:02:27.530> failure<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.950> terms<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> cake<00:02:29.670> and

have failure in terms of the cake and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.890 
have failure in terms of the cake and
that's<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.570> baking<00:02:30.870> powder

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
that's the baking powder

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.470 
that's the baking powder
you<00:02:32.200> only<00:02:32.349> use<00:02:32.620> 1/2<00:02:33.579> a<00:02:33.760> teaspoon<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.420> baking

done<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.500> know<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> say<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.269> two<00:02:44.079> people

when<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.769> do<00:02:44.890> professional<00:02:45.400> development

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
when I do professional development

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.220 
when I do professional development
training<00:02:45.879> is<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.569> know<00:02:46.659> your<00:02:46.810> family

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
training is that you know your family

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.899 
training is that you know your family
engagement<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.340> baking<00:02:48.730> powder

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
engagement is really the baking powder

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.479 
engagement is really the baking powder
of<00:02:49.329> their<00:02:49.540> student<00:02:49.900> achievement<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:51.189> seems

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
of their student achievement it seems

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.490 
of their student achievement it seems
like<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> small<00:02:52.060> thing<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.720> very<00:02:53.200> easily

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like a small thing it's very easily

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.860 
like a small thing it's very easily
overlooked<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.970> boy<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.299> makes<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.599> huge

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
overlooked but boy it makes a huge

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.199 
overlooked but boy it makes a huge
difference<00:02:56.379> if<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.680> don't<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.579> so

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
difference if you don't have it and so

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.569 
difference if you don't have it and so
without<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.349> baking<00:02:59.680> powder<00:02:59.859> in<00:03:00.159> any<00:03:00.310> recipe

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
without the baking powder in any recipe

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.690 
without the baking powder in any recipe
the<00:03:01.480> cake<00:03:01.659> is<00:03:01.840> not<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.290> rise<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.069> I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
the cake is not going to rise and I

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.270 
the cake is not going to rise and I
think<00:03:04.329> similarly<00:03:04.870> if<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.379> have<00:03:05.620> your

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
think similarly if you don't have your

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.430 
think similarly if you don't have your
family<00:03:06.519> engaging<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.420> your<00:03:07.780> recipe<00:03:08.349> of

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
family engaging in your recipe of

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.839 
family engaging in your recipe of
student<00:03:08.769> improvement<00:03:08.980> your<00:03:09.340> students<00:03:09.760> are

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
student improvement your students are

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.309 
student improvement your students are
never<00:03:09.940> going<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.269> rise<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:10.870> skills<00:03:11.170> are

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
never going to rise your skills are

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.170 
never going to rise your skills are
never<00:03:11.470> gonna<00:03:11.650> rise<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.549> levels<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:12.970> we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
never gonna rise to the levels that we

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.509 
never gonna rise to the levels that we
want<00:03:13.450> them<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.629> so<00:03:14.349> your<00:03:14.560> family<00:03:14.980> engagement

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
