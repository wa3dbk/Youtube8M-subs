Honda<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> first<00:00:18.840> players<00:00:19.230> in

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
Honda was one of the first players in

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040 
Honda was one of the first players in
the<00:00:19.619> premium<00:00:19.890> hatch<00:00:20.130> space<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> Jazz<00:00:21.360> but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the premium hatch space for the Jazz but

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
the premium hatch space for the Jazz but
at<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.950> Indian<00:00:23.220> market<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.790> was

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
at that time the Indian market just was

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.630 
at that time the Indian market just was
not<00:00:24.390> ready<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:25.200> such<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> car<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:26.340> though

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
not ready for such a car now though

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.999 
not ready for such a car now though
times<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.239> different<00:00:27.509> and<00:00:27.869> Honda<00:00:28.529> has<00:00:28.710> just

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
times are different and Honda has just

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.979 
times are different and Honda has just
launched<00:00:29.399> its<00:00:29.579> new<00:00:29.820> third-generation<00:00:30.509> jazz

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
launched its new third-generation jazz

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.400 
launched its new third-generation jazz
arm<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.310> set<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> tools<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:33.989> we

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
arm the right set of tools by which we

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
arm the right set of tools by which we
mean<00:00:34.559> aggressive<00:00:35.100> pricing<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.910> doodle

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
mean aggressive pricing and a doodle

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
mean aggressive pricing and a doodle
engine<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> question<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.430> good<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
engine so the question is how good is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.700 
engine so the question is how good is
the<00:00:39.000> new<00:00:39.149> jazz<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:40.079> let<00:00:40.590> us<00:00:40.710> find<00:00:40.949> out<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
the new jazz well let us find out the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.529 
the new jazz well let us find out the
previous<00:00:43.710> jazz<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.879> MPV<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
previous jazz was more like an MPV and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.689 
previous jazz was more like an MPV and
less<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.019> hatchback<00:00:46.309> however<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> same

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
less like a hatchback however the same

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.939 
less like a hatchback however the same
cannot<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.149> said<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> new<00:00:48.929> model<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
cannot be said for the new model as it

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.860 
cannot be said for the new model as it
looks<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.519> more<00:00:50.760> sleeker<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.239> much<00:00:51.629> more

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
looks much more sleeker and much more

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
looks much more sleeker and much more
aggressive<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.499> before<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.489> some

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
aggressive than before there are some

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
aggressive than before there are some
styling<00:00:54.089> details<00:00:54.480> taken<00:00:54.809> over<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> city<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
styling details taken over the city and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
styling details taken over the city and
it<00:00:55.980> works<00:00:56.219> quite<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.539> example<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it works quite well for example the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.989 
it works quite well for example the
sharp<00:00:58.440> new<00:00:58.589> headlamps<00:00:59.129> blend<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.579> well<00:00:59.760> with

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
sharp new headlamps blend in well with

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.970 
sharp new headlamps blend in well with
that<00:01:00.120> multi-layered<00:01:00.719> grille<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.800> our

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that multi-layered grille and in our

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
that multi-layered grille and in our
opinion<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.519> front<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:02.999> best<00:01:03.420> view<00:01:03.659> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
opinion the front is the best view of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
opinion the front is the best view of
the<00:01:03.870> new<00:01:04.080> Jazz<00:01:04.379> move<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.370> side<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the new Jazz move to the side and the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
the new Jazz move to the side and the
MPD<00:01:06.390> proportions<00:01:07.050> somewhat<00:01:07.560> revealed

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
MPD proportions somewhat revealed

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.010 
MPD proportions somewhat revealed
themselves<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.540> designers<00:01:09.990> have

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
themselves but on that designers have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
themselves but on that designers have
cleverly<00:01:10.620> added<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> various<00:01:11.520> lines<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
cleverly added in various lines to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
cleverly added in various lines to
disguise<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.560> 15-inch<00:01:13.979> wheels<00:01:14.280> though

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
disguise that the 15-inch wheels though

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
disguise that the 15-inch wheels though
look<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.149> small<00:01:15.509> after<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> sharp<00:01:16.649> front

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
look a bit small after the sharp front

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
look a bit small after the sharp front
end<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> real<00:01:17.640> styling<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> bit<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.899> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
end the real styling is a bit of a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.289 
end the real styling is a bit of a
contrast<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.250> certainly<00:01:20.549> love<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
contrast but we certainly love the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
contrast but we certainly love the
stunning<00:01:21.689> LED<00:01:22.170> tail<00:01:22.439> lamps<00:01:22.619> plus<00:01:23.430> the

tailgate spoiler adds in to the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.690 
tailgate spoiler adds in to the
