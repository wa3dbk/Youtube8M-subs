00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.029
 the nature is beautiful 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.619
 I wish it could last forever 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.640
 This is just unreal 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.660
 why does nobody do something while others do 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.619
 Set discuss the energy change 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.900
 we just turn it over 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.510
 The man is already driving seriously 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.879
 75 percent of long-distance trains with 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.010
 regenerative energy 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.750
 the best you can do now 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.640
 hang out world improver 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 I have the dream of 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.260
 the green card already fulfilled with 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.540
 every bahncard stretch time card or 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.489
 the environmental plus surcharge of only one 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.460
 tiny euro bought the train in 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.600
 against a value Ã¶kostrom 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.729
 now i can be my attractive one 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.159
 Sitting neighbor say this wonderful 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.820
 landscape out there that's all mine 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.100
 earnings 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
 They do not believe that then they look 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 check the environmental mobile online 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.270
 the path to sustainability also has 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.450
 the train top priority 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.659
 alone in 2013 where 900,000 tons of co2 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.700
 saved and by 2050 wants 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.930
 the ground to be completely CO2-free 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.220
 so nada zero mixes that too 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.310
 Works on water and 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.090
 wind power the problem is winter has one 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.920
 Electricity but the hair is in the bucket 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.430
 no winter are the hair 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.440
 but my current contrast helps a 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.790
 hydrogen hybrid power plant as 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.340
 Germany's largest pantograph 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.909
 The railway is investing heavily in this 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.770
 groundbreaking storage technology also in the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.170
 carsharing has set db the trend 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.080
 and is with 580 cars germany 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.780
 largest supplier of electric cars in the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.940
 version belly legs po is the model 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.409
 equal to 9000 times for disposal and calls 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.840
 Call a bike 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.870
 but what nice friends would be the whole 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.390
 without active nature conservation and therefore 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.520
 the track donates trees in a big way 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.860
 and apprentices and so got two fly with 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.510
 a flap holes in the forest and stuff 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.940
 the future tracks the same times 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.250
 plant right attitude so 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.250
 The oars are not always nice 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.300
 when he said we turn the whole thing 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.629
 day in the green I have somehow 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.629
 presented differently 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.440
 and if you do not have wind , you will become one 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.210
 The text comes next time shows you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.470
 benny what is behind the mysterium 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:46.940
 I hide network track for mine 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.940
 Part I love you
