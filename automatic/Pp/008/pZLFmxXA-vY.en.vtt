Cars you can see as seen in monster
truck<00:00:58.620> mater<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.520> guessing<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
truck mater I'm guessing that is the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.590 
truck mater I'm guessing that is the
name<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> cars<00:01:01.379> tune<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
name of the cars tune that this was in

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020 
name of the cars tune that this was in
or<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.320> these<00:01:04.439> were<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> few

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
or that these were in there are a few

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.490 
or that these were in there are a few
other<00:01:06.210> ones<00:01:06.360> available<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
other ones available but these are the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.660 
other ones available but these are the
only<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.860> gonna<00:01:07.979> pick<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.400> quite

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
only two I'm gonna pick up but quite

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810 
only two I'm gonna pick up but quite
expensive<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:11.010> nine<00:01:11.400> dollars

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
expensive they are I think nine dollars

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330 
expensive they are I think nine dollars
which<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> pretty<00:01:13.080> ridiculous<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.770> ask<00:01:13.890> me

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730 
which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me
I<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> why<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I get to why I think that here in a

I get to why I think that here in a
minute

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

has<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.980> rubbery<00:02:33.340> tires<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.790> mean<00:02:33.909> they're<00:02:34.030> not

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
has the rubbery tires I mean they're not

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.610 
has the rubbery tires I mean they're not
rubber<00:02:34.420> they're<00:02:34.689> still<00:02:34.930> pretty<00:02:35.200> hard<00:02:35.439> they

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
rubber they're still pretty hard they

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
rubber they're still pretty hard they
don't<00:02:35.769> squish<00:02:36.189> like<00:02:36.219> a<00:02:36.519> real<00:02:36.790> writer<00:02:37.000> but

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
don't squish like a real writer but

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.369 
don't squish like a real writer but
they're<00:02:38.049> not<00:02:38.230> hard<00:02:38.920> plastic<00:02:39.669> either<00:02:40.379> these

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
they're not hard plastic either these

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.319 
they're not hard plastic either these
tires<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.549> tow<00:02:42.790> mater<00:02:43.060> are<00:02:43.329> hard<00:02:44.169> plastic

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
tires on this tow mater are hard plastic

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.030 
tires on this tow mater are hard plastic
so<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.719> Monster<00:02:46.989> Jam<00:02:47.019> Trucks<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.769> think<00:02:47.980> are

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
so the Monster Jam Trucks I think are

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.979 
so the Monster Jam Trucks I think are
about<00:02:48.129> three<00:02:48.400> dollars<00:02:48.489> fifty<00:02:49.030> cents<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.840> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
about three dollars fifty cents and I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.709 
about three dollars fifty cents and I
think<00:02:50.439> maybe<00:02:51.219> four<00:02:51.519> dollars<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.000> think<00:02:52.599> these

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
think maybe four dollars I think these

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.250 
think maybe four dollars I think these
are<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.049> same<00:02:53.290> range<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.579> I<00:02:54.930> don't<00:02:55.930> believe

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
are in the same range so I don't believe

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.530 
are in the same range so I don't believe
that<00:02:56.590> sticking<00:02:57.449> plastic<00:02:58.449> tires<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.739> a<00:03:00.669> larger

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
that sticking plastic tires and a larger

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.830 
that sticking plastic tires and a larger
suspension<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:03.129> vehicle<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:04.299> really

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
suspension on this vehicle is really

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.129 
suspension on this vehicle is really
worth<00:03:05.079> an<00:03:05.590> extra<00:03:05.919> five<00:03:06.099> dollars<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.930> think<00:03:07.930> that

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
worth an extra five dollars I think that

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.780 
worth an extra five dollars I think that
they're<00:03:08.349> trying<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.709> make<00:03:08.859> money<00:03:09.040> off<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
they're trying to make money off of the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.979 
they're trying to make money off of the
name<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.949> they're<00:03:12.419> sacrificing<00:03:13.419> quality<00:03:13.540> to

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
name and they're sacrificing quality to

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.110 
name and they're sacrificing quality to
do<00:03:14.109> so<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.500> would<00:03:15.069> like<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.459> see<00:03:15.669> this<00:03:15.879> with

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
do so I would like to see this with

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240 
do so I would like to see this with
rubber<00:03:16.359> tires<00:03:16.510> instead<00:03:17.439> of<00:03:17.530> these<00:03:17.650> plastic

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
rubber tires instead of these plastic

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.999 
rubber tires instead of these plastic
tires<00:03:18.609> cuz<00:03:19.509> it's<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:19.989> these<00:03:20.470> just<00:03:20.739> aren't<00:03:20.949> as

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.009 
tires cuz it's just these just aren't as

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.789 
tires cuz it's just these just aren't as

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
dollars I was hoping for a better made

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.140 
dollars I was hoping for a better made
vehicle<00:03:26.319> but<00:03:27.099> nonetheless<00:03:27.370> it's<00:03:27.759> pretty<00:03:27.939> cool

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
vehicle but nonetheless it's pretty cool

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.659 
vehicle but nonetheless it's pretty cool
and<00:03:28.509> will<00:03:29.169> look<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.349> fine<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.889> my<00:03:29.979> shelf<00:03:30.280> no

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
and will look just fine on my shelf no

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.740 
and will look just fine on my shelf no
one<00:03:30.790> will<00:03:30.879> ever<00:03:30.939> know<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.329> it<00:03:31.389> has<00:03:31.509> plastic

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
one will ever know that it has plastic

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.759 
one will ever know that it has plastic
tires<00:03:32.280> how<00:03:33.280> upon<00:03:34.049> looking<00:03:35.049> at<00:03:35.319> this<00:03:35.439> one<00:03:35.650> it

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
tires how upon looking at this one it

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.520 
tires how upon looking at this one it
also<00:03:35.949> has<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.879> plastic<00:03:37.120> tires<00:03:37.509> so<00:03:38.409> I'm

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
also has the plastic tires so I'm

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.939 
also has the plastic tires so I'm
guessing<00:03:38.889> that's<00:03:39.009> a<00:03:39.250> line<00:03:39.669> wide<00:03:40.000> feature<00:03:40.949> I

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
guessing that's a line wide feature I

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.589 
guessing that's a line wide feature I
