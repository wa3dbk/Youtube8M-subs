 Hello ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
 Welcome to the 2nd episode of Mehdy Von Ti's recipes 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.980
 The chef is unavailable 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.920
 Hello dear mehdy von ti 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 Stomach problems 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.620
 I ate something weird 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.240
 But every problem has a solution! 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
 We will find something else 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 A little lost without the chef 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.840
 Improvise ... 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940
 1st ingredient, beat box 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.580
 Let's add a piano 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 No, it does not work! 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.220
 I may be an idea for you 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 Who are you? 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.440
 Your inspiration 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
 Add 1 guitar 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 it's ringing! 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 What do you think of adding a melody? 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 What do you think about it? it's ringing! 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 But I do not have lyrics 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 what do you think of a Latin touch? 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 In Spanish 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 Lyrics in Spanish 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 But I do not speak Spanish 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 do not worry, I have something for you 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120
 look at your phone 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 no matter if you do not understand 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 Sung 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960
 2 seconds, I'm calling someone 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.920
 Chief? 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180
