00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:17.300
 Today is Play America's Largest Charged Products Show in Las Vegas ces 2015 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:21.780
 In the beginning of that Sony announced the top model zx 2 of Walkman 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 Right on not a death but it zx one-of successor had been 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.630
 The key is definitely improved by the fact that the zx 1 was sold to the point where it was very expensive 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.390
 I suppose 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:41.770
 zx 2 is also likely to be quite high, and the planned sales price in the US is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:46.690
 It's 99 cents to take 1119 It's a price that I can't reach for me 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:50.650
 Seventh in the shadow feelings feeling that say shit but I was reading an article of the net in the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:56.530
 Among them , there was one point to be worried about 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:01:01.760
 zx 2 and the new type of bluetooth headphones mdr 1 abt the same time 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:06.040
 We have also announced something like this, but combining these two makes Sony unique 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.470
 Developed bluetooth codec l dac 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:17.020
 l It is something that will be able to hear good high-quality sound in the dark 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.220
 I am enjoying wireless listening at mdr 1 rbt mark ii 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.210
 Because it is human 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.680
 l Dark I felt so crazy about it 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.700
 Most sorry ridiculous the was examined it was found Amataira can be good 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.460
 Though 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:37.340
 For bluetooth codecs or compression standards 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 I'm talking about has previously say that there is something is sbc aac Apt x 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 Sbc means 328 kb per second transfer bit rate 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:57.719
 This time though, this release of Er Zac is up to three times the amount of information of sbc 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.899
 High resolution quality such as 24 bit 96 khz that can be played 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.350
 It seems that data transmission can be done 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:15.090
 In zx 2 l seems to be able to switch the setting of the school district to 3 stages 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:20.800
 If you choose from 330660990 the bluetooth project limit is about 1 mb 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:26.020
 Since the par of seconds clogging lines kb Per Seconds say 990 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.270
 Is that the upper limit of the limit is that it can take a large dynamic range 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.840
 Also the reproduction frequency band 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:38.200
 If it corresponds to 24 bits 96khz 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.790
 In other words, it is good that it is high res support in Sony 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:48.349
 It's not about cutting, but it's hi- res 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:54.319
 It is expressed like the sound of the station This is whether Higa includes a lossy compression sound source in the high res 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:57.860
 I'm not sure yet in Japan, so I say so conservatively, but it's substantive 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:04.130
 I think that it is okay to say that high res 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.020
 Depending on the environment, the sound may be interrupted if the 990 kb Persepon road is used. 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.100
 There is 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:17.410
 If it is 660, it seems to be a practical level in the environment of a train or so 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:22.090
 As it is Sony's own standard , I think that the usable range is limited for a while 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:26.950
 The new technology is very welcome for our users, isn't it? 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.600
 For a while it may be limited to flagship machines like zx 2 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 If time passes 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 By that I wonder if we are adopted Well also to the lower model 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.400
 Honor of Okuma was released in a whopping last November I thought and I I want to look forward to the future 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.410
 series 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.370
 I forgot to buy because I thought that xperia would be enough if I listened to Abt x 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.080
 Though 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.320
 It seems to correspond to l school district with spring software update of this year 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 It is a good This is probably big news 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:06.790
 This is ne- mdr 1 rbt mark ii I just bought this 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.830
 The can promotion corresponding to the mile amount even wrote 1 abt 2 times 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.810
 I feel like it's worth it This is really a big hope 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.500
 Since there is a part where the contents which came today are broken a little , check the linked article by all means 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.650
 Please give me 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.160
 I am really looking forward to official announcements in Japan 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.160
 Well then
