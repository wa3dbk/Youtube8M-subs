to the scrap pile and we cut him up a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.210 
to the scrap pile and we cut him up a
few<00:01:36.190> pieces<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.869> ship<00:01:38.140> them<00:01:38.290> down<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.800> them<00:01:38.950> and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
few pieces we ship them down to them and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.900 
few pieces we ship them down to them and
we<00:01:39.700> are<00:01:39.940> 34<00:01:40.840> years<00:01:41.080> later<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.800> I<00:01:42.070> think<00:01:42.790> at

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
we are 34 years later and I think at

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.490 
we are 34 years later and I think at
this<00:01:43.030> point<00:01:43.150> we've<00:01:43.510> made<00:01:43.780> him<00:01:43.900> about<00:01:44.170> three

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
this point we've made him about three

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.450 
this point we've made him about three
million<00:01:44.860> pieces<00:01:45.510> it's<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.600> lot<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.900> pieces<00:01:47.460> it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
million pieces it's a lot of pieces it's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.850 
million pieces it's a lot of pieces it's
a<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.970> lot<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.300> pieces<00:01:52.410> we<00:01:53.410> produced

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
a really a lot of pieces we produced

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.580 
a really a lot of pieces we produced
them<00:01:54.100> first<00:01:54.490> with<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.820> sharp<00:01:55.179> cut<00:01:55.509> edge<00:01:55.720> and<00:01:56.080> the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
them first with a sharp cut edge and the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.770 
them first with a sharp cut edge and the
sharpness<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.399> didn't<00:01:57.759> look<00:01:57.820> great<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.479> didn't

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
sharpness it didn't look great it didn't

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.750 
sharpness it didn't look great it didn't
look<00:01:58.899> like<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.350> ice<00:01:59.470> cube

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.610 

what<00:02:03.760> we<00:02:03.910> figured<00:02:04.360> out<00:02:04.480> finally<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:05.260> we

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
what we figured out finally was we

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.940 
what we figured out finally was we
rented<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.130> cement<00:02:06.490> mixer<00:02:07.410> dumped<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.470> bucket<00:02:08.679> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
rented a cement mixer dumped a bucket of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.000 
rented a cement mixer dumped a bucket of
them<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.310> there<00:02:09.960> they<00:02:10.960> tumble<00:02:11.350> against<00:02:11.830> each

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
them in there they tumble against each

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.430 
them in there they tumble against each
other<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.490> it<00:02:12.760> gets<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.180> good<00:02:13.510> finish<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
other and it gets a good finish on the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.480 
other and it gets a good finish on the
edges<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:17.020> know<00:02:17.140> there<00:02:17.410> are<00:02:17.440> ways<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> solve

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
edges you know there are ways to solve

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.690 
edges you know there are ways to solve
almost<00:02:18.760> every<00:02:19.270> problem<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.250> know<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.520> New

architectural<00:02:27.370> stone<00:02:27.700> has<00:02:27.940> certainly<00:02:28.480> had

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
architectural stone has certainly had

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.930 
architectural stone has certainly had
its<00:02:28.720> issues<00:02:28.990> over<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.560> last<00:02:29.620> five<00:02:30.370> years<00:02:30.400> or

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
its issues over the last five years or

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.800 
its issues over the last five years or
so<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.740> whiskey<00:02:33.100> stone<00:02:33.430> says<00:02:33.790> help<00:02:34.209> keep<00:02:34.630> us

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
so the whiskey stone says help keep us

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.810 
so the whiskey stone says help keep us
afloat<00:02:35.280> quite<00:02:36.280> honestly<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:38.700> remember<00:02:39.700> my

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
afloat quite honestly I remember my

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.190 
afloat quite honestly I remember my
grandfather<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.480> remember<00:02:40.870> he<00:02:41.050> had<00:02:41.170> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
grandfather I remember he had that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.440 
grandfather I remember he had that
bottle<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:41.920> he<00:02:42.130> kept<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.520> on<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> top<00:02:43.060> shelf

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
bottle that he kept up on a top shelf

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.930 
bottle that he kept up on a top shelf
and<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.709> always<00:02:44.920> kind<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.400> broke<00:02:45.580> his<00:02:45.760> heart

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and it always kind of broke his heart

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
and it always kind of broke his heart
that<00:02:46.060> he<00:02:46.180> had<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.420> put<00:02:46.600> an<00:02:46.660> ice<00:02:46.870> cube<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.320> there

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
that he had to put an ice cube in there

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.260 
that he had to put an ice cube in there
because<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.100> would<00:02:48.520> always<00:02:48.670> melt<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.239> little

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
because it would always melt a little

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.960 
because it would always melt a little
bit<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.260> stone<00:02:50.590> he<00:02:51.550> would<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.820> loved

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
bit and the stone he would have loved
