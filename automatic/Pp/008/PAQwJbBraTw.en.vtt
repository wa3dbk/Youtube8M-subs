at this point we're just wrapping it and
going<00:03:51.400> over<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.820> as<00:03:51.970> we<00:03:52.180> move<00:03:52.209> down<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.630> little

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
going over it as we move down a little

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.490 
going over it as we move down a little
bit<00:03:53.050> at<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> time<00:03:53.370> giving<00:03:54.370> us<00:03:54.489> some<00:03:54.820> space<00:03:55.500> to

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
bit at a time giving us some space to

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.460 
bit at a time giving us some space to
neatly<00:03:56.769> cover<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.970> wood<00:03:58.269> or<00:03:58.510> plastic<00:03:58.900> earring

neatly cover the wood or plastic earring
whatever<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.830> decide<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.310> use<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.390> we're<00:04:01.540> just

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
whatever you decide to use so we're just

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.960 
whatever you decide to use so we're just
going<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.810> go<00:04:01.989> around<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.890> making<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.640> taut

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
going to go around it and making it taut

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.070 
going to go around it and making it taut
or<00:04:07.510> tight<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.890> doesn't<00:04:08.980> slip<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:10.080> also

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
or tight so that it doesn't slip I also

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.770 
or tight so that it doesn't slip I also
have<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> method<00:04:11.680> where<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:11.830> use<00:04:12.130> glue<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:13.600> quite

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
have a method where I use glue but quite

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.900 
have a method where I use glue but quite
frankly<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.440> think<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:14.920> much<00:04:15.100> neater<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.670> use

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
frankly I think it's much neater to use

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.030 
frankly I think it's much neater to use
just<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.019> noodle<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.320> thread<00:04:17.620> method<00:04:17.979> you

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
just the noodle and thread method you

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.290 
just the noodle and thread method you
can<00:04:18.250> use<00:04:18.489> glue<00:04:18.700> super<00:04:19.150> glue<00:04:19.359> or<00:04:20.280> East

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
can use glue super glue or East

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.330 
can use glue super glue or East
6-thousand<00:04:22.300> glue<00:04:23.100> information<00:04:24.100> will<00:04:24.220> be<00:04:24.280> in

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
6-thousand glue information will be in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:46.939 
6-thousand glue information will be in
the<00:04:24.430> link<00:04:24.580> below<00:04:24.900> as<00:04:25.900> well

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.990 

we're<00:04:47.949> almost<00:04:48.100> done<00:04:48.430> with<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.669> particular

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
we're almost done with this particular

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.860 
we're almost done with this particular
part<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.479> it<00:04:49.630> again<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:51.220> corners<00:04:51.729> can<00:04:52.660> be<00:04:52.840> a

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
part of it again the corners can be a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.840 
part of it again the corners can be a
little<00:04:53.110> tricky<00:04:53.440> because<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.979> fabric<00:04:54.729> that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
little tricky because the fabric that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.689 
little tricky because the fabric that
you're<00:04:55.030> using<00:04:55.800> but<00:04:56.800> at<00:04:57.280> some<00:04:57.460> point<00:04:57.490> you

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
you're using but at some point you

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:58.860 
you're using but at some point you
decide<00:04:57.940> if<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.060> want<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.330> use<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.449> whole<00:04:58.720> lot

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
decide if you want to use a whole lot

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.140 
decide if you want to use a whole lot
more<00:04:59.110> going<00:05:00.070> around<00:05:00.370> those<00:05:00.490> edges<00:05:00.850> is<00:05:00.970> where

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
more going around those edges is where

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.730 
more going around those edges is where
it<00:05:01.210> gets<00:05:01.360> tricky<00:05:06.210> either<00:05:07.210> wrap<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.600> fabric<00:05:07.810> as

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
it gets tricky either wrap the fabric as

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.920 
it gets tricky either wrap the fabric as
we<00:05:09.220> get<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.610> end<00:05:09.789> I'm<00:05:10.060> seeing<00:05:10.570> how<00:05:10.750> much

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
we get to the end I'm seeing how much

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.110 
we get to the end I'm seeing how much
fabric<00:05:11.440> I<00:05:11.710> need<00:05:11.949> don't<00:05:12.639> really<00:05:12.910> need<00:05:13.060> that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
fabric I need don't really need that

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.779 
fabric I need don't really need that
much<00:05:13.300> after<00:05:13.870> this<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:14.349> I'm<00:05:15.310> going<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.520> go<00:05:15.699> about

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
much after this so I'm going to go about

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:25.050 
much after this so I'm going to go about
around<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.479> one<00:05:16.660> more<00:05:16.840> time<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:24.310> was<00:05:24.460> it's<00:05:24.849> much

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
around it one more time it was it's much

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.379 
around it one more time it was it's much
neater<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.479> my<00:05:25.570> opinion<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.650> end<00:05:26.949> your

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
neater in my opinion if you end your

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.719 
neater in my opinion if you end your
sewing<00:05:28.389> at<00:05:28.539> the<00:05:28.990> back<00:05:29.199> of<00:05:29.440> your<00:05:29.830> earring<00:05:30.160> so

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
sewing at the back of your earring so

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.180

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
so enough fabric make sure you use your

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.430 
so enough fabric make sure you use your
hands<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.479> secure<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.080> end<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:45.419> your<00:05:46.440> rolling
