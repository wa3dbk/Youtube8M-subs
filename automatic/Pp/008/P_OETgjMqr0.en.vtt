00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
Morgana could stack up against the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.070 
Morgana could stack up against the
LeBlanc's<00:00:11.940> ocp<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> want<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> come<00:00:12.750> back<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.019> you

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
LeBlanc's ocp I want to come back to you
and<00:00:13.110> let<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> finish<00:00:13.590> your<00:00:13.889> point<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.580> about

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and let you finish your point here about

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.060 
and let you finish your point here about
that<00:00:15.210> LeBlanc<00:00:15.599> but<00:00:15.750> yeah<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that LeBlanc but yeah I think that it is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
that LeBlanc but yeah I think that it is
risky<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.940> give<00:00:18.480> fake<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> LeBlanc<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.590> think

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
risky to give fake a LeBlanc but I think

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010 
risky to give fake a LeBlanc but I think
they<00:00:19.949> did<00:00:20.160> everything<00:00:20.609> correct<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.660> had<00:00:21.869> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
they did everything correct they had it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.179 
they did everything correct they had it
planned<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
planned out and I think this is

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
planned out and I think this is
something<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.000> will<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.510> coming

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
