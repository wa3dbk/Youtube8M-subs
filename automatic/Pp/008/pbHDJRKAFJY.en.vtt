00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.070
 good day 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.559
 street portrait one of the most affordable 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.760
 kinds of photos often we do such 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.859
 portraits in the parks on the streets where we 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 allow in word but not always to 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.430
 unfortunately the weather would tell us 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.270
 and the light is extremely uninteresting 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.490
 try today to do some 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.490
 photos of our beautiful model marga 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.809
 very well unfortunately in this light 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.269
 portrait rarely enough 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.030
 expressive and in order to solve 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.920
 this problem use the remote 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.539
 light royal of phrase second generation 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.489
 one of the distinguishing features 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.050
 This device is an opportunity 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.280
 work from an autonomous power source 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.019
 bundled 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:01.010
 let's connect the battery with 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:10.549
 cable for this you need to combine 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:13.130
 red dots on the instrument and connector on 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.630
 wire the same way connect it to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.479
 power supply turn on the device 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.009
 counterpart oval full readiness to 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.430
 monoblock power came on top of the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.390
 monoblock can be installed 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.859
 radio synchronizer that we connect 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.149
 the camera will remind you that a feature of this 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.189
 synchronizer is the ability 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.539
 mode selection directly from the camera 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.539
 that is, you do not need to run to the device 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.740
 let's send our device to the model we will translate 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.740
 camera in shutter priority mode 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.100
 maintain the synchronization speed selected 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.100
 us diaphragm 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.420
 photos have become significant 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.979
 expressive the only thing I wanted 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.070
 would correct it probably 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.100
 the exposure will make a power correction 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.360
 device and another duplicate 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.590
 excellent also portable light can 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.080
 use as back 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.680
 source for this we rearrange our 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:35.030
 a source 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:36.350
 behind the model is an important feature of the device 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.360
 second- generation frieze is 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.110
 use standard bennett 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.660
 bounce that allows you to work with a wide 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.660
 a range of accessories available and 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.320
 look at me
