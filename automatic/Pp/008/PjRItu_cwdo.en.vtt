00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.610

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:37.240

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:40.880
 a little bit here and so is still a little wipe 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.770

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.020
 i 'm going to get back to you soon 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.209
 Well warmed our countrymen 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.730
 grandmother and so here it all looks in 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.880
 ready to see in general there is tomato rice 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.310
 sauce and these are the 2 types of sausages type 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.170
 cutlets in general sausages cutlets and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 here's a little fry worth such here 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 appetite principle everything looks pretty 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 not bad so here everything is fine in 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 Well then let's try and then 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.150
 already there my stomach starts raging 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.340
 let's start with rice now 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.910
 take a little bit 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.220
 pick up and put the side part so 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.220
 come here rice well problems 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.410
 in principle, the usual sheet decide well 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.060
 still say porizu let me here 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.700
 Interestingly most glitches women try as 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.330
 it tastes delicious and no way by the way 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.720
 did this 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.650
 this kebab me some dude calling 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.810
 I wanted to make shorter courses on 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.850
 the exchange, that is, there that with stocks is everything 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.130
 blah blah blah does not burden uninteresting 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.650
 go see he look but you know what 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.920
 Now the situation in the country is a game 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.920
 Well, the dollars rose than nothing there 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.780
 such yes not by fire not only that 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 the dollar has risen to me only now here 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.170
 it is more difficult to order ebay 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.709
 more this dollar on me at all 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.510
 in no way reflected as well 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.959
 so here I wanted something there in a pair 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.769
 tiger 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.200
 where from here dude yes on let's try 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.560
 easy woman 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.570
 Lula-kebab, in principle, such sweets 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:41.600
 normal 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:42.020
 come on with tomato sauce 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.110
 to taste 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.110
 but without the sauce it seems to me it would not be very 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.100
 basically good this great woman but 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.580
 such a feeling you know as if 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.370
 just about outside roasted until 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.710
 inside a little bit like no-no-no 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.860
 baked that is, as it were, outside the norm 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.320
 but inside it seemed a little damp that 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.970
 whether or something like that in principle a dish 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.890
 good as if here so here all 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.760
 Stir so that the bottom is in the whole tomato 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.160
 here's a tina there automaton so that the risk was 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.250
 in tomato or mediawiki 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.970
 and the grandmother was a machine gun in principle 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.970
 good dishes 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.310
 you can eat so let 's try again 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:46.130
 one piece of this can not kebab because 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:48.070
 that i haven't tasted it 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:57.830
 normally shorter 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:06:00.170
 Come Well, well, in principle, a score of 4 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.050
 I think you can give to Peter of course not 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.190

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.560

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.480
 principle for bends let's normal 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.020
 here engri beers try this here 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.320
 here is a chick 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.070
 I already said it costs 40 rubles oranges 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:24.020
 I don't like cola at all 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.030
 I used pure carbonation to try and I 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.880
 I did not understand why he was not the sparkling 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:34.010
 have i discovered even hissed nothing or 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:39.490
 he should be that you did not understand 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:43.580
 guys and where is the newspaper 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.770
 frame gas it should be a drink 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.930
 heavily carbonated no or a little 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:53.030
 I say or I'm kosyachu 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:56.450
 so so so drink non-alcoholic 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.430
 strongly carbonated and where is it 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.110
 heavily carbonated 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.890
 so the pupil will gas somewhere out not 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.480
 I know the main thing in general, let's not 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.130
 try 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:16.280
 drink super strongly carbonated straight 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:18.710
 there is plenty of gases here but not you 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.650
 some kind of trick that he shouldn't 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.630
 be it without any gas 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:27.400
 why can he do this? 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:31.240
 wounded a little bit we donâ€™t know 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.240
 give it a try now 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:40.980
 But the taste of cola to taste the taste of cola 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.290
 smack 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.660
 a little bit of oranges there gives a little bit 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.050
 that is, so here it is possible such nastiness 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.660
 I will not drink of course 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.850
