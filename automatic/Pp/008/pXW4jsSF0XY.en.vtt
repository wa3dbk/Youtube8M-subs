00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.650 

and<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:50.980> gonna<00:02:51.069> ride<00:02:51.370> in<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.760> other<00:02:51.880> hand<00:02:52.209> at

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and it's gonna ride in the other hand at

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.520 
and it's gonna ride in the other hand at
the<00:02:52.810> time<00:02:53.020> T<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.819> we<00:02:55.000> throw<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.239> pole<00:02:55.569> at

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
the time T so if we throw the pole at

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.660 
the time T so if we throw the pole at
the<00:02:56.620> time<00:02:56.950> zero<00:02:57.430> number<00:02:58.239> four<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:03.190> throw<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the time zero number four we throw it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.640 
the time zero number four we throw it
with<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:03.970> right<00:03:04.209> hand<00:03:04.239> we've<00:03:05.110> got<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.260> receive

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
with the right hand we've got a receive

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.890 
with the right hand we've got a receive
it<00:03:05.830> with<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.459> right<00:03:06.670> hand<00:03:07.000> again<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:10.030> we<00:03:10.660> have

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
it with the right hand again so we have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.759 
it with the right hand again so we have
the<00:03:11.410> magic<00:03:11.920> glow<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.780> sight<00:03:13.780> shot<00:03:14.080> not<00:03:14.560> some

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
the magic glow of sight shot not some

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.770 
the magic glow of sight shot not some
properties<00:03:15.370> that's<00:03:15.610> going<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.940> help<00:03:16.060> us<00:03:16.330> to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
properties that's going to help us to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.960 
properties that's going to help us to
make<00:03:17.010> side<00:03:18.010> swap<00:03:18.310> right<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:20.080> basic<00:03:20.650> basic

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
make side swap right so the basic basic

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.390 
make side swap right so the basic basic
formula<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:25.680> we're<00:03:26.680> gonna<00:03:26.830> make<00:03:27.190> an

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
formula is the we're gonna make an

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.750 
formula is the we're gonna make an
addition<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.769> values<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.220> numbers<00:03:30.340> of

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
addition of the values of the numbers of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.870 
addition of the values of the numbers of
the<00:03:30.850> troughs<00:03:31.500> between<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.100> number<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:33.430> throws

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the troughs between the number of throws

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.570 
the troughs between the number of throws
is<00:03:34.420> going<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.870> equal<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.250> number<00:03:36.549> of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
is going to be equal to the number of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.839 
is going to be equal to the number of
balls<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.239> we<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.599> okay<00:03:38.380> let's<00:03:39.069> check<00:03:39.549> for
