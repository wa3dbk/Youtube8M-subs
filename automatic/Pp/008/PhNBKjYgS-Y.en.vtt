00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 in this section we will learn how to make a pickle 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
 We'll show you how to make "Cauliflower Pickle" 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.800
 But let's take a look at the list of materials before you want 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 1 piece of medium cauliflower (about 1.5 pounds) 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.960
 2 pieces of carrot 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.240
 10 garlic cloves 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.880
 1 tea cup rock salt 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920
 1 tea cup of grape vinegar 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 1 tablespoon lemon salt 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 1 tablespoon powder sugar 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.800
 10-15 branches of parsley 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.160
 Let's take our pickle now 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.560
 first we robbed our carrots 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 I doÄŸrayal 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.840
 In the meantime, we cut our cauliflower into pieces ... 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 we washed a beautiful 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 chopping carrots 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.600
 now we will rob our garlic, but how will we rob it? 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.240
 so 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 we'll also make him keep his aroma 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.680
 no more chopping or crushing 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 garlics are also ready 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 now we get a jar of the right size 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.760
 the cauliflower ... 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.600
 carrots ... 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 garlic ... 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 leaving 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.280
 Now some lemon salt ... 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 Let's add some salt 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 Let's have garlic ... 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 a few branches of parsley 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.520
 let us continue this way 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.800
 final parts 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.240
 garlic, lemon salt ... 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.000
 sugar provides sugar fermentation 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 rock salt ... 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 and finally to be the cover ... 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.240
 putting some parsley 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.880
 now we are leaving residual liquid materials 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 grape vinegar ... 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.160
 and the boiled water we boiled ... 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 add up to level 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.120
 we filled the water until one finger remained 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.400
 cover tightly 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.080
 and 2 weeks waiting 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.080
 after 2 weeks 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.240
 yes 2 weeks 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.920
 "Allah is with the patience" 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 now we're opening our pickles 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.280
 these are cauliflower's face 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.280
 see absolutely no distortion 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.400
 Now let's take it from our service plate 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.440
 has a nice smell of pickles 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.080
 that way we can take it to the table 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.040
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.760
 We learned the construction of "Cauliflower Pickles" 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.200
 we waited a little but believe it was a nice recipe worth waiting for 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.760
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 goodbye...
