from these would gain hand from like a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.900 
from these would gain hand from like a
light<00:02:01.040> shimmery<00:02:03.220> shadows<00:02:04.220> then<00:02:04.580> we<00:02:04.760> go

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
light shimmery shadows then we go

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.480

towards the that's actually a brown I
don't<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.180> there<00:02:09.050> maybe<00:02:09.290> that<00:02:09.500> helps<00:02:09.740> a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
don't know there maybe that helps a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.740 
don't know there maybe that helps a
little<00:02:09.920> bit<00:02:10.100> that's<00:02:10.729> actually<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.150> brown<00:02:11.450> and

then we're moving into a silver like a
grayish<00:02:15.830> silver<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.640> then<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:19.040> looks

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
grayish silver and then a that looks

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.920 
grayish silver and then a that looks
really<00:02:19.430> pink<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:19.970> screen<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.570> it's<00:02:20.720> not

really pink on the screen but it's not
Ziggy<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:22.460> was<00:02:22.580> my<00:02:22.700> cat<00:02:22.970> um<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:26.270> then<00:02:26.390> we

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
Ziggy that was my cat um and then we

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.900 
Ziggy that was my cat um and then we
move<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:27.050> deeper<00:02:27.530> purple<00:02:28.010> Tony's<00:02:28.400> or

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
move it to like deeper purple Tony's or

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.930 
move it to like deeper purple Tony's or
violet<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.600> might<00:02:29.750> want<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.990> call<00:02:30.170> them<00:02:30.350> um

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
violet you might want to call them um

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:40.180 
violet you might want to call them um
but<00:02:31.940> yeah<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.300> one<00:02:32.420> last<00:02:32.650> look<00:02:33.650> here

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.980 

and<00:02:40.580> again<00:02:40.970> these<00:02:41.090> are<00:02:41.150> comparable<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
and again these are comparable to the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.320 
and again these are comparable to the
Urban<00:02:42.320> Decay<00:02:42.350> colors<00:02:42.950> basically<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.910> think<00:02:44.210> the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
Urban Decay colors basically I think the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.610 
Urban Decay colors basically I think the
idea<00:02:44.360> hello<00:02:45.230> camera<00:02:45.620> boom<00:02:45.950> over<00:02:46.700> here

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
idea hello camera boom over here

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.140 
idea hello camera boom over here
basically<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.980> idea<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:50.540> think<00:02:51.320> this

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
basically the idea of I think this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.030 
basically the idea of I think this
palette<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> give<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.350> lot<00:02:54.920> of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
palette is just to give you a lot of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.870 
palette is just to give you a lot of
nice<00:02:55.220> fall<00:02:55.610> colors<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:57.020> are<00:02:57.140> pretty<00:02:57.290> bold

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
nice fall colors that are pretty bold

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.010 
nice fall colors that are pretty bold
this<00:02:58.880> does<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> lot<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.480> shimmer<00:02:59.780> these

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
this does have a lot of shimmer these

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.360 
this does have a lot of shimmer these
two<00:03:00.290> when<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.710> consider<00:03:01.130> highlighters<00:03:02.200> and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
two when I consider highlighters and

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.000 
two when I consider highlighters and
these<00:03:04.370> go<00:03:04.730> really<00:03:04.970> great<00:03:05.300> in<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.630> crease

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
these go really great in the crease

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.670 
these go really great in the crease
these<00:03:07.010> colors<00:03:07.280> i<00:03:07.520> typically<00:03:07.880> put<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.420> lid

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
these colors i typically put on the lid

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.470 
these colors i typically put on the lid
you<00:03:09.680> can<00:03:09.890> switch<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.670> up<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.970> little<00:03:11.090> bit<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
you can switch it up a little bit and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.140 
you can switch it up a little bit and
maybe<00:03:11.600> put<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.590> color<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.580> lid<00:03:13.820> and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
maybe put this color on the lid and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.750 
maybe put this color on the lid and
blend<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.990> color<00:03:15.290> upwards<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.770> out<00:03:16.010> but<00:03:16.550> all

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
blend this color upwards and out but all

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.070 
blend this color upwards and out but all
there's<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.360> lot<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.540> different<00:03:17.870> combinations

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
there's a lot of different combinations

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.920 
there's a lot of different combinations

another alternative that you can maybe

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.000 
another alternative that you can maybe
look<00:03:46.880> into<00:03:47.030> if<00:03:47.660> you're<00:03:48.470> thinking<00:03:48.709> about

look into if you're thinking about

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.590 
look into if you're thinking about
getting<00:03:49.340> something<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:50.090> The<00:03:50.239> Naked<00:03:50.420> palette

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
getting something like The Naked palette

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.390 
getting something like The Naked palette
or<00:03:51.140> maybe<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.680> want<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:51.980> try<00:03:52.160> something

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
or maybe you want to try something

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.430 
or maybe you want to try something
different<00:03:52.580> because<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.660> lot<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.840> times<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.260> don't

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
different because a lot of times I don't

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.060 
different because a lot of times I don't
think<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.890> Urban<00:03:55.550> Decay<00:03:55.580> shadows<00:03:57.070> blend

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
think that the Urban Decay shadows blend

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.380 
think that the Urban Decay shadows blend
all<00:03:58.430> that<00:03:58.580> well<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.880> don't<00:03:59.150> think<00:03:59.300> that

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
all that well and I don't think that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.630 
all that well and I don't think that
some<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.660> them<00:03:59.840> have<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.260> lot<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.560> pigment<00:04:01.040> but

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
some of them have a lot of pigment but

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.870 
some of them have a lot of pigment but
who<00:04:01.850> knows<00:04:01.970> that's<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.390> me<00:04:02.510> personally<00:04:02.690> um<00:04:03.200> i

you might be able to get it alta too but

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.140 
you might be able to get it alta too but

i noticed that sephora seem to have a
bigger<00:04:14.390> collection<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.609> lower<00:04:16.609> rank<00:04:16.700> products
