00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 a great happiness the truth that was a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.500
 great fight I'm very happy to make him 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.710
 a good battle to floyd mayweather that 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 a great champion is next to us more 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.030
 beyond that a great job also with 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.740
 robert because you came with air to the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 last rank that does not arrive with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.609
 critical conditions very well we have 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.300
 worked very well with robert with alex 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.539
 ariza and all the gym equipment 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.539
 worked very well in a moment I thought 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.380
 I do not remember the round but if I had it 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:40.350
 in some places in some robberies very 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.620
 between the 8th and the tenth that the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.390
 king nor you 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.980
 I felt that I could not grasp when 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.570
 he started walking because he hoped he knew 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.370
 that stayed against the rope that 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.140
 I could grab but I felt that 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.690
 gloves when I hit had no effect 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.339
 but only with the gloves that I had to 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.040
 I had to fight if I was going to hurt him 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.260
 you felt the blows at some point a 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.860
 right that grabbed me if it went on 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 but no more because he connected future the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.070
 311 santista but I do not connect just from 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.259
 but I do not know no, it did not hurt me to feel 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.060
 the blow but now the speed that 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.450
 has is amazing at least when one 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.450
 he sees it from outside 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.229
 but I also made him pass some 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.539
 knocks gross designs because in addition 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.729
 you were very good at rotating the waist and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.440
 when you launched already the anticipated ones 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.850
 easy things 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.560
 I had to tell him they passed a few punches and 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.090
 fight was better for you an exquisite and 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:48.689
 BOLOGNA against ice cream almost equal 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.399
 I do not know what to see in the rival and the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:57.350
 experience out there also game 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.350
 the factor for what 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.600
 and I think that more 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 a walnut 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.459
 but if not a fall something of that and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.459
 some manu you felt that you entered full 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.470
 they have a net hand of those yours no no 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.380
 no not because very difficult says that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.140
 It is always with water the defenda very 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:31.190
 good that more or less than I thought 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.190
 it will not be untouchable 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.160
 answer that 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.670
 is the revenge or nothing in September 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.040
 I would like 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.310
 Fight with another person or wait to see 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:59.500
 What's up 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:03.340
 what happens over time and nothing about 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.020
 I do not feel that you can tell me what 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.910
 I want but I think the blows 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.890
 he felt healthier and 18 mayweather 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.260
 and ended the boxing year for you 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.710
 if there is a rematch would be very good to me 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.710
 would like 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.280
 is set at a time now when 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.260
 They will not be very significant deals 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.230
 I 'm going to wait for the rematch against 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.290
 floyd mayweather with another opponent not with 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.360
 Who am I going to fight with another glove? 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.219
 and if you give me the missed opportunity with 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.219
 another glove and does not start crying 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.790
 how did you get 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.340
 wonder for the skills 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.420
 it is said is the truth that but good I 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.420
 I think it's great to win
