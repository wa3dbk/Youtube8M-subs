down here on the bottom I've already
taken<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.939> liberty<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> cutting<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.650> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
taken the liberty of cutting that so we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
taken the liberty of cutting that so we
can<00:00:22.980> go<00:00:23.130> ahead<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.789> open<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.810> it

can go ahead and just open it now it
just<00:00:24.990> slides<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.650> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> front

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
just slides off like so and on the front

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
just slides off like so and on the front
of<00:00:29.250> course<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> earpods

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
of course we do have the earpods

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.810 
of course we do have the earpods
themselves<00:00:31.230> let's<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.710> set<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.219> aside<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
themselves let's just set this aside and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.569 
themselves let's just set this aside and
here<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.960> we<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.460> a

just pops off like so and then the
headphones<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.180> unwind<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.320> I'm<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.829> going

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
headphones just unwind so I'm just going

featured on the other headphones however

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.200 
featured on the other headphones however
this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.989> slightly<00:00:55.559> revised<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this is slightly revised from the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
previous apple headphones that shipped

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670 
previous apple headphones that shipped
with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.579> iphone<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.410> tell<00:01:01.469> right

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
with the iphone so as you can tell right

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
with the iphone so as you can tell right
off<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.190> bat<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> different

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
off the bat it is kind of different

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000 
off the bat it is kind of different
however<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.260> does<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> same

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
however it does have the same

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
however it does have the same
functionality<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> volume<00:01:07.110> up

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
functionality so we have the volume up

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
functionality so we have the volume up
and<00:01:07.650> volume<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:08.310> toggles<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
answering calls as well as of course

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
answering calls as well as of course
activating<00:01:13.979> series<00:01:14.400> alright<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.270> take

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
activating series alright now let's take

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
activating series alright now let's take
a<00:01:15.509> closer<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.290> them<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
a closer look at them so they have a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
a closer look at them so they have a
series<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> ports<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> each<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:18.990> has<00:01:19.020> its<00:01:19.200> own

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
series of ports and each one has its own

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
series of ports and each one has its own
different<00:01:19.680> function<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> top

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
different function so the one at the top

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
different function so the one at the top
here<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.020> tuning<00:01:22.380> mid-range<00:01:22.890> frequencies

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
here is for tuning mid-range frequencies

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.460 
here is for tuning mid-range frequencies
and<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> ones<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.600> down<00:01:24.840> below<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and the ones here down below at the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
and the ones here down below at the
bottom<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> improve<00:01:26.880> base<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
bottom are actually to improve base and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
bottom are actually to improve base and
it<00:01:27.780> does<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.080> by<00:01:28.140> letting<00:01:28.560> air<00:01:28.799> flow<00:01:29.070> through

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it does this by letting air flow through

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
it does this by letting air flow through
the<00:01:29.579> acoustic<00:01:30.119> chamber<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.990> let<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.290> speaker

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the acoustic chamber to let the speaker

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
the acoustic chamber to let the speaker
move<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.250> freely<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> main<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.900> right

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
move more freely now the main one right

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
move more freely now the main one right
here<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> course<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.220> directing<00:01:35.700> sound

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
here of course is for directing sound

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
here of course is for directing sound
directly<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> ear<00:01:37.530> canal<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:38.280> these

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
directly into the ear canal now these

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850 
directly into the ear canal now these
are<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.150> ear<00:01:39.540> headphones<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.650> will

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
are not in ear headphones so they will
