and the blasters let's go ahead and get
them<00:02:05.939> transformed<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:07.409> thing<00:02:07.530> we're<00:02:07.649> gonna

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
them transformed first thing we're gonna

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
them transformed first thing we're gonna
do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.520> fold<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.849> out<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.300> form<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
do is just fold that out to form the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.040 
do is just fold that out to form the
feet<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.920> loosen<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.450> rotate<00:02:12.900> them

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
feet then loosen these and rotate them

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.970 
feet then loosen these and rotate them
forward

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
forward

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.000 
forward
so<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.370> stand<00:02:15.610> flat<00:02:16.530> next<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
so that he can stand flat next is the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.260 
so that he can stand flat next is the
infamous<00:02:18.550> cone<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:20.560> pop<00:02:20.800> open<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.670> center

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.350 

twist<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.510> cone<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.850> can<00:02:27.880> pull

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
twist the cone like that so we can pull

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.340 
twist the cone like that so we can pull
it<00:02:28.450> through<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:31.000> cone<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.840> rotate<00:02:32.230> it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
it through the cone up and rotate it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.290 
it through the cone up and rotate it
back<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:33.490> form<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.850> face<00:02:35.640> well<00:02:36.640> get<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
back to form a face well get the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.920 
back to form a face well get the
accessories<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:38.350> form<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.740> fists<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.930> demo

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
accessories that form the fists and demo

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.070 
accessories that form the fists and demo
on<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.360> attach<00:02:43.360> them<00:02:43.720> into<00:02:43.930> place<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.050> a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
on and attach them into place this is a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.280 
on and attach them into place this is a
good<00:02:47.320> solid<00:02:48.160> connection<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.300> then<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.080> will

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
good solid connection and then we will

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.650 
good solid connection and then we will
take<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.890> blasters<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.670> attach<00:02:54.940> them<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.300> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
take the blasters and attach them to the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.100 
take the blasters and attach them to the
arms<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.820> prefer<00:02:58.270> these<00:02:58.420> blasters<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
arms now I prefer these blasters the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.360 
arms now I prefer these blasters the
long<00:02:59.530> blasters<00:03:00.520> as<00:03:00.730> opposed<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:02.380> missiles

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
long blasters as opposed to the missiles

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.810 
long blasters as opposed to the missiles
I<00:03:03.490> just<00:03:03.910> prefer<00:03:04.330> them<00:03:04.660> better<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:06.610> we

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
I just prefer them better and then we

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.770 
I just prefer them better and then we
will<00:03:07.000> take<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:08.220> wings<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.610> reattach<00:03:10.420> them

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
will take the wings and reattach them

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.680 
will take the wings and reattach them
thusly<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:15.670> kind<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:15.880> lean<00:03:16.090> them<00:03:16.270> off<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
thusly just kind of lean them off to the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.580 
thusly just kind of lean them off to the
side<00:03:16.930> there<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.970> there<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.209> go<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:20.560> have

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
side there and there we go we have

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.470 
side there and there we go we have
