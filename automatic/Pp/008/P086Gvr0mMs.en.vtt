00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it the first thing you need to know

it the first thing you need to know
about<00:01:06.180> coconut<00:01:06.659> oil<00:01:07.159> before<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
about coconut oil before we get into it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
about coconut oil before we get into it
is<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.900> has<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> very<00:01:10.260> low<00:01:10.650> melting<00:01:10.920> point

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
is that it has a very low melting point

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020 
is that it has a very low melting point
so<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.180> melt<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.159> 72<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.729> 73

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so it will melt at I think it's 72 or 73

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.190 
so it will melt at I think it's 72 or 73
degrees<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:17.600> besides<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.020> fact

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
degrees so right now besides the fact

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
degrees so right now besides the fact
that<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> smells<00:01:20.479> unbelievable<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.280 
smells like you're sticking your face
right<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.640> coconut<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.080> sort

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
right in a coconut you can see it's sort

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
right in a coconut you can see it's sort
of<00:01:25.409> solid<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.580> how<00:01:26.729> well<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.939> can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of solid I don't know how well you can

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.080 
of solid I don't know how well you can
see<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.049> solid<00:01:28.710> once<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.820> gets<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
see that but it's solid once it gets to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.429 
see that but it's solid once it gets to
a<00:01:30.180> certain<00:01:30.240> temperature<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> said<00:01:31.290> about

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
a certain temperature like I said about

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.789 
a certain temperature like I said about
73<00:01:31.950> degrees<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.450> liquefies<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
73 degrees it then liquefies so you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
73 degrees it then liquefies so you
actually<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.030> careful<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.290> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
actually have to be careful with how you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
actually have to be careful with how you
apply<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.340> skin<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.360> it'll<00:01:39.570> be

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
apply it to your skin because it'll be

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
apply it to your skin because it'll be
almost<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.140> putting<00:01:40.380> olive<00:01:40.860> oil<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> your

skin<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.210> might<00:01:42.600> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
skin so you might want to have like a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
skin so you might want to have like a
tiny<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.590> spoon<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> keep<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.700> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
shampoo can't quite get the oil out so

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.860 
shampoo can't quite get the oil out so
you<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.340> two<00:02:48.060> rounds<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:48.780> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
you have to go two rounds and then I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.350 
you have to go two rounds and then I
regularly<00:02:49.110> condition<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.190> that's<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.940> your

it's really really good at trapping in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.960

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
moisture so I love it now the thing you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
have to know about coconut oil is it's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400 
have to know about coconut oil is it's
unlike<00:03:32.160> cream<00:03:32.940> which<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.269> quickly<00:03:33.690> absorbing

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
unlike cream which is quickly absorbing

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.680 
unlike cream which is quickly absorbing
so<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.829> actually<00:03:35.069> kind<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.030> lingers<00:03:36.359> on<00:03:36.540> your
