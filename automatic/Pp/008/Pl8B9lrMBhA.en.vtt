00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.870 
yeah which is why you know I've actually
been<00:01:46.509> meaning<00:01:46.689> this<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.220> still<00:01:48.520> don't<00:01:48.700> get

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
been meaning this and I still don't get

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.569 
been meaning this and I still don't get
it<00:01:48.939> really<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.600> mean<00:01:49.960> it's<00:01:50.710> just<00:01:50.920> very<00:01:51.400> very

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
it really I mean it's just very very

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.090 
it really I mean it's just very very
difficult<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.570> sort<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.900> suddenly<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.860> here

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
difficult to sort of suddenly be on here

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.399 
difficult to sort of suddenly be on here
yeah<00:01:54.549> firing<00:01:55.479> up<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.600> web<00:01:55.780> browser<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.290> then

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
yeah firing up a web browser and then

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.039 
yeah firing up a web browser and then
flicking<00:01:56.680> over<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.549> these<00:01:58.119> controls<00:01:58.689> aren't

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
flicking over and these controls aren't

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.800 
flicking over and these controls aren't
very<00:01:59.380> clearly<00:01:59.740> labeled<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:01.600> just

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
very clearly labeled and there it's just

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.270 
very clearly labeled and there it's just
very<00:02:02.110> very<00:02:02.259> tricky<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.799> get<00:02:02.979> there<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
very very tricky you get there in the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.920 
very very tricky you get there in the
end<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:03.820> it's<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.240> take<00:02:04.329> a<00:02:04.479> bit<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.840> time

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
end but it's going to take a bit of time

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.139 
end but it's going to take a bit of time
I've<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.860> looks<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.189> me<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.790> side<00:02:07.119> would

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
I've it looks to me like that side would

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.330 
I've it looks to me like that side would
work<00:02:07.600> well<00:02:07.750> as<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.019> media<00:02:08.259> player<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:09.159> not

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
work well as the media player but not

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.940 
work well as the media player but not
necessarily<00:02:09.789> anything<00:02:10.299> else<00:02:10.620> but<00:02:11.620> then<00:02:11.769> if

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
necessarily anything else but then if

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.949 
necessarily anything else but then if
you've<00:02:12.099> got<00:02:12.309> a<00:02:12.549> web<00:02:12.909> browser<00:02:13.120> yeah<00:02:13.540> yeah

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
you've got a web browser yeah yeah

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.800 
you've got a web browser yeah yeah
exactly<00:02:14.230> yes<00:02:14.620> that's<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.219> bit<00:02:15.309> smaller

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
exactly yes that's a little bit smaller

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.510 
exactly yes that's a little bit smaller
no<00:02:16.020> definitely<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.830> seems<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.310> know

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
no definitely but it seems like you know

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.620 
no definitely but it seems like you know
there's<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:17.940> there's<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.270> halfway<00:02:18.569> stage

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
there's like there's a halfway stage

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630 
there's like there's a halfway stage
they<00:02:19.080> need<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.349> do<00:02:19.500> em<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> side<00:02:20.610> or

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
they need to do em on the side or

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.510 
they need to do em on the side or
something<00:02:21.209> just<00:02:21.780> massive<00:02:22.739> extendable<00:02:23.310> thing

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
something just massive extendable thing

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.930 
something just massive extendable thing
to<00:02:23.670> come<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.959> like<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.020> big<00:02:25.230> screen<00:02:25.530> yeah<00:02:25.950> well

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
to come out like a big screen yeah well

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.940 
to come out like a big screen yeah well

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
ericsson phone from 2001 yeah but then

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.210 
ericsson phone from 2001 yeah but then
when<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.049> see<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.650> does<00:04:07.799> what<00:04:07.950> kind<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
when you see that it does what kind of

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.069 
when you see that it does what kind of
make<00:04:08.400> sense<00:04:08.430> yeah<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.090> think<00:04:09.359> it's<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.720> toggling

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
make sense yeah I think it's a toggling

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.349 
make sense yeah I think it's a toggling
between<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.530> two<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:11.069> hope<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.579> know<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:12.209> web

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
between the two I hope you know the web
