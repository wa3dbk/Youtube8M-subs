00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.170
 they are all the pivots of this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.259
 brand new unboxing video in the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.379
 our motherboard around 87 hicks 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.189
 today the version over clocking all modem 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.980
 11 50 obviously lg audi 50 per mile 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.810
 professor 47 70 carp this is one of the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 the most important members of the CAC am 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 saying they are all important from 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.740
 back and component let's say 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 main of ours of our pc 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.590
 because it allows you to attack all the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.469
 our age devices on the terrace 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.310
 channel and then manage no we can pass 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.660
 the music 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.510
 design with inside chipset thoughts at 37 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.090
 obviously from the brand name giro ma 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.800
 because this ride because he always has 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.410
 took house by chance if you really 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.960
 an excellent first 90 bank that I had 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 some problems so don't tell me I have 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.300
 decided to entrust him with a party ho 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.460
 seen in various forums asking around 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.190
 a little I saw that this backrest 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.950
 really really so I have it 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.350
 learned this I took it for the over 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.119
 clocking this is a hundred percent compatible 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 percent with lexington 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:23.830
 what is slow I don't know if it's legal 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.600
 macintosh though black iii the cell 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.650
 the operating system I just want 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.810
 try it lennon and use for purposes 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.420
 I just want to try it, I just want to try 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.550
 the mac system on my machine e 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.130
 this is also compatible with the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.280
 hackintosh system well let it be 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.610
 not boxing this wonderful world the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.050
 face can go well we can 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.000
 see here that our card is there 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.380
 mother, however, we have that which sees ours 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.479
 content this is the truth 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 after the effect here we can go out everything 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.189
 here we have our back plate 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.280
 to talk about our back 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.549
 houses there will be all the revenue e 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.679
 get your motherboard out of this 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.430
 ball set on the weight obviously and 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.560
 we have a very beautiful beautiful 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.349
 sticker of the gino pante that I will go to the south 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.860
 of stuck at least c70 money of 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.880
 core 6 two cables sata per per 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.720
 attack our burners I would like 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 hard disk and other two been in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:37.540
 crossfire x for our mt in cards 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.610
 crossfire and our nvidia slide 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 these beautiful drains so you do 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 with the bit 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.660
 then the cock had a b of it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.150
 configuration of our knox that 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.609
 the bulk here we have one thing really 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.350
 Really very beautiful 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.319
 this is what this allows 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.799
 make the worst but that in ours 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.690
 city and to attach our cards 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.280
 video this must be attached to the card 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.359
 mother in the way of the cards of which one 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.950
 Once it falls will our 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.960
 write write about going on a bet e 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.300
 does above and no 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.990
 for insulators they obviously have an amount 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.210
 of the bad card to do we say there 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.790
 they are benchmark banquets that do not 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.530
 have supports for video cards and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.630
 so this is a very good one 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.660
 a great proposal of the must try 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.720
 try more video cards 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.300
 in our benchmark bench 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.760
 here we have an ultra durable looks like one 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.880
 our classic brand of condoms 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.540
 driver driver's ct of yours 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.240
 motherboard 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.900
 from here we have the classic user ever 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.060
 network that English shit we have the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 our user manual that does not 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.310
 understand very powerful law of this 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.890
 manual to be able to understand 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.920
 more what are we going to pass the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.220
 thesis that instead our motherboard a 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.210
 this is the installation guide 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.320
 perfect we pass to our card 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.920
 bad we can take it yours 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:19.820
 packet 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.830
 to damage it is up to this casing 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.740
 we extract the true mind directly here 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.430
 above to do this damage laws well 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.699
 this is our fantastic and evil 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.770
 we can see you our pc at 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:39.810
 express and are four 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:42.180
 obviously sly we can have one 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.060
 power management of the two notes 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.090
 video cards in two because then the two 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.949
 no less powerful third parties because there are 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.410
 cards but the most expensive ones they manage 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.830
 this thing does not die even made milano 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.199
 acute 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.080
 here we have our asset management 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.889
 even without even the keys we have 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.620
 this management 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.570
 the motherboard then comes religion 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.280
 other bridges for all the various stupid things 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.240
 parts of the realization see ours 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.700
 only and cars in dc 54 quay 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.030
 for a maximum of 32 gb 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.690
 in the rear a connector for the 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:27.870
 displayport connector for the hdmi a 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:31.750
 connector for audio with optical fiber 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:38.860
 we have another hd and even total 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:41.830
 we have 4 6 usb 3.0 ports and others here 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.620
 twice 2.0 we lose a convenient key 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.950
 for the reset of the dl it is imposed for 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.530
 reset the settings of the virus that 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.840
 maybe for some overclocking 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.090
 tomorrow it can be all for later 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.770
 to be able to start again with that poverty 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.990
 here we get our display command 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.650
 that in almost all our cards 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.250
 mothers move are we lose psb 3.0 for 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.890
 the front panel of the usb 3.0 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.480
 we have the 24 pin connector of the ma 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.460
 our motherboard for 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.530
 limitation of our motherboard or 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:20.080
 instead we have the twelve 2x4 pin pods for 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.760
 power in our c more 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.730
 we have 4 6 sata iii e doors in all 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:33.910
 here we have two usb with today we have 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:36.760
 other usb 3.0 equa another two usb 2.0 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.330
 Naples to connect the audio in the part 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.580
 from the front and here we have the 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.530
 our sound card in the part 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.660
 back of the keynes all the various 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.340
 link the pearls to check the 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.680
 our our card more 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.020
 switching on and off of the 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.529
 our motherboard but of course the 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.089
 event management 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:02.989
 system fan we have two more fans 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:05.989
 system fan we have one two three in 

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:08.209
 total should be six if I 'm not mistaken 

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:11.239
 what to say this is a great motherboard 

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:13.759
 as I have already said for macintosh for 

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.929
 robert clock of contrÃ  cases that then to the 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.659
 end of this evening there will be 

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:19.549
 the assembly of my pc was already play 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:22.549
 showed others how he could 

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:24.649
 see other components are varied 

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:26.479
 seen that you go to see at the end 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:28.449
 will do the test is obviously this 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:32.599
 tab note together with the script boys 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:34.759
 we will do the shopping of the cpi 74 770k 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:35.839
 on this obviously always on this 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.579
 motherboard 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:39.829
 so no guys sign up if 

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:41.599
 the interest of following my series 

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:44.269
 to get to the point 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:45.469
 I'm looking forward to the pci assembly 

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.019
 born I do not like you liked this 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:50.179
 both xing commented to let me know what 

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:52.219
 think of this on this sheet 

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:54.349
 bad or maybe if you've already bought it 

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:56.269
 and subscribe to the channel to avoid getting lost 

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:59.979
 the next videos so no guys 

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:59.979
 see you at the next video and chat
