how many hides to get now we have 300
producing<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:39.410> what<00:00:39.530> are<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.680> main<00:00:39.860> tasks<00:00:40.489> of

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.340 
producing and what are the main tasks of
being<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.970> people<00:00:41.390> that<00:00:43.420> look<00:00:44.420> after<00:00:44.720> you<00:00:44.840> stop

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
being a people that look after you stop

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.680 
being a people that look after you stop
really<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:45.860> like<00:00:45.920> on<00:00:46.190> family<00:00:46.629> so<00:00:47.629> you

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
really it's like on family so you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.299 
really it's like on family so you
actually<00:00:47.900> look<00:00:48.260> after<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.680> bees<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.160> then

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
actually look after the bees and then

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.340 
actually look after the bees and then
get<00:00:49.850> them<00:00:52.449> really<00:00:53.449> built<00:00:53.750> up<00:00:53.870> as<00:00:54.019> much<00:00:54.170> as

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
get them really built up as much as

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.600 
get them really built up as much as
possible<00:00:54.379> because<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.190> bees<00:00:55.340> have<00:00:55.580> been

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
possible because the bees have been

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.200 
possible because the bees have been

your night and you being a beekeeper man
you're<00:02:18.360> working<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> keep<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.350> up<00:02:19.640> hard<00:02:20.640> hands
