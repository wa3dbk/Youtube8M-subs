00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
bit of water around since the mix is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.350 
bit of water around since the mix is
light<00:01:00.050> well<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.380> can<00:01:01.560> get<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.830> on

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's just enough since the mix is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.110 
that's just enough since the mix is
fairly<00:01:10.220> light<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:12.080> want<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.440> pack<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:13.120> you're

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
fairly light you want to pack it you're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.340 
fairly light you want to pack it you're
going<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.330> add<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:15.040> bit<00:01:16.040> more<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:17.230> you're<00:01:18.230> gonna

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
we minimize air exposure get a little

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.300 
we minimize air exposure get a little
