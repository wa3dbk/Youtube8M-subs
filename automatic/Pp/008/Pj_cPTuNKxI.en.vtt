00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 or welcome to the resolution of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 third exercise of the power course 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.360
 point 2007 in this exercise we have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.690
 included 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 a background to the dispositives an image 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.610
 in one way the logo of the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.130
 company 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.380
 and a contact text in the part 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.450
 right of the design all these objects 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.920
 both the image and the background the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.750
 logo and text are objects that 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.750
 provide with the exercise 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.190
 well to do the exercise we go to 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.420
 design that we did in the previous 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.689
 Exercise number 2 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 about this design we will insert in first 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.920
 place the fund and click on any 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.509
 free zone of the slide with the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.479
 the right button of the mouse 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.900
 we will go to the background format within 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.290
 this dialog box 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.700
 press on the option filled with 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.430
 image or texture 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.409
 and we will tell you that we have to insert a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.149
 image of this file we will press 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 archive 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.950
 we will search is not 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.340
 background with this image 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 that is going to be the fund in this case 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.210
 background 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.450
 remember that it is a file that is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 within the exercise and that has 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.310
 provided we will insert 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.189
 we have inserted the fund that 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.609
 we could select mosaic as 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.259
 texture but only in those cases 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.340
 in which the image is not 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.590
 large enough to form or 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.190
 completely fill the background set 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.850
 in this part 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.350
 a mosaic is created with the image that 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.840
 we have selected this as background 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.250
 our case is not necessary since 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.000
 the image you provided is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.890
 large enough to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 to scratch the background completely 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.420
 We could use trips 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.490
 if we want 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.920
 move the background image towards the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.170
 right or to the left in this 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.540
 case 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 as you take percentage sounds 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.860
 and once we have 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.880
 configured to our background with the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.700
 image and with the displacements 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.700
 timely press on apply 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.600
 the next object that we are going to insert 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.310
 within our design is going to be a 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.830
 image and remember that image 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 I found inside a way for it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.950
 let's insert shape the way 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.630
 selected was a hexagon we pressed the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.390
 uppercase key on the keyboard so that 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.140
 image in this case the form 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.340
 if you believe in a proportionate way and 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.400
 we drag towards the design 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 Once the form is created, we will rotate the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 a little bit for that we use the marker 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 that you see at the top of the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.010
 shape that is green we click on it and 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.890
 we rotate the form a bit 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.579
 once we have achieved this effect 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.650
 we are going to insert the image inside 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.490
 this figure for it we click with the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.860
 right mouse button shape format 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.470
 and we are going to act exactly and when 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.830
 we insert the background into our 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.630
 operative 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.630
 Stuffed with image or texture 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:05.359
 click on file to select 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.200
 the image we say that we have background or 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.069
 photo 01 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.069
 and insert 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.060
 and now notice that once is uncertain 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.130
 the image is not provided for 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.889
 what it provides we are going to mark a 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.160
 mosaic image as texture so that 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.250
 create a mosaic with 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.290
 the own photo gives me 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.530
 and I have set by default that 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.020
 the scale to 50% so that all 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.910
 photo elements appear within 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.630
 the shape 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.630
 and we close 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.760
 still missing 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.040
 the line to the edge for it to equal 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.920
 right mouse button format 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.920
 line color image we say that without 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.730
 line and we close 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.639
 in this way our image remains 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.620
 within the selected form 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.719
 now we will insert the last object 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.460
 within our design that is the text 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.830
 of contact that is situated in the part 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.370
 right of our slide for it 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.620
 we will open the text file that has been 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.719
 published with this exercise what 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.139
 we will copy and paste it into the 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.259
 operative 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.300
 to paste it we will simply have to 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.719
 create a text box within 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.719
 insert 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.560
 anywhere in the sport 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.939
 we cooperate 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.939
 now we will select our 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.530
 text 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.860
 and we will change the format to start 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.310
 we will change the size 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.390
 to 9 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.370
 the typeface 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.770
 to caliber and that's fine 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.130
 and finally the color the color 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.020
 selected in this case is going to be a 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.569
 orange 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.349
 for example the orange of the palette 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.990
 original and now what we will do will be 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:14.040
 turn it for it we use the 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.210
 turning tool 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.889
 Y 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.100
 that we can turn it on any 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.100
 position 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.600
 if we want the turn to be 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.330
 less 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.490
 abruptly press the uppercase key of the 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.479
 keyboard 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.599
 the text is automatically placed as 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:40.289
 we want and we take it to its position 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.289
 correct 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.360
 remember what 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.840
 to rotate the text we can use the 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:56.050
 green dot 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.960
 well with this the design is finished 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.860
 and exercise number 3 of the course of 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.860
 powerpoint 2007
