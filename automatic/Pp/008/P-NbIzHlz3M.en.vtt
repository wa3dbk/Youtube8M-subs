a hell of a time getting that sled out
of<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.699> online<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
of there so I was going online and I

snow bungee which is actually kind of
cool<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.660> basically<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> giant<00:00:28.380> rubber<00:00:28.590> band

cool it's basically a giant rubber band
you<00:00:29.099> hook<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> back<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:29.939> snowmobile

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you hook up to the back here snowmobile

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.020 
you hook up to the back here snowmobile
and<00:00:30.920> he<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.250> gives<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> extra<00:00:32.820> a

and he just gives you that extra a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.150 
and he just gives you that extra a
little<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> couple<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> feet<00:00:34.230> extra

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
little bit like a couple of feet extra
to<00:00:35.309> run<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:35.670> snowmobile<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.329> build<00:00:36.480> up

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to run up your snowmobile and build up

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
to run up your snowmobile and build up
kinetic<00:00:37.020> energy<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.520> pull<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> out

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
kinetic energy into what you pull it out

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
kinetic energy into what you pull it out
instead<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.239> being<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.510> hard<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
instead of being so hard on just the

instead of being so hard on just the
rope<00:00:40.760> yank<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> sled<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.540> of

rope yank me on the sled and I kind of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
rope yank me on the sled and I kind of
like<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> idea<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.739> online<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.219> check

ends so you can clip it to a ski loop on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.050 
ends so you can clip it to a ski loop on
the<00:02:49.320> our<00:02:49.620> case<00:02:49.920> cuz<00:02:50.160> we've<00:02:50.280> got<00:02:50.400> steel<00:02:50.700> skis

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the our case cuz we've got steel skis

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.700 
the our case cuz we've got steel skis
and<00:02:51.240> seals<00:02:51.570> ski<00:02:51.900> loops<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.290> anything<00:02:52.500> else

and seals ski loops or anything else

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.890 
and seals ski loops or anything else
that's<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.460> little<00:02:53.970> bit<00:02:54.060> more<00:02:54.210> sturdy<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that's a little bit more sturdy so you

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.430 
that's a little bit more sturdy so you
can<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:57.990> also<00:02:58.140> make

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
can do that and then you can also make

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.710 
can do that and then you can also make

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.330 
didn't need nearly as much and what I
got<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.590> basically<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
got here is that basically just the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.320 
got here is that basically just the
round<00:03:09.060> four<00:03:09.960> braids<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.920> doubled<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.520> so

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
round four braids so I doubled it up so

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.560 
round four braids so I doubled it up so
realistically<00:03:13.200> there's<00:03:13.470> four<00:03:14.010> time<00:03:14.360> get<00:03:15.360> lost

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
realistically there's four time get lost

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.750 
realistically there's four time get lost
so<00:03:18.570> basically<00:03:19.320> what<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:20.130> four

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so basically what we have is four

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.360 
so basically what we have is four
strands<00:03:21.560> maximum<00:03:22.560> we've<00:03:22.739> got<00:03:22.920> here<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.190> issue

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
strands maximum we've got here is issue

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.940 
strands maximum we've got here is issue
two<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:24.840> got<00:03:24.959> two<00:03:25.110> strands<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.620> strength

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
two so we got two strands of strength

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.780 
two so we got two strands of strength
maximum<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.090> often<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.520> use<00:03:29.520> one

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
maximum here and I often not to use one

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.130 
maximum here and I often not to use one
clip<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.330> bungee<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.840> because<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.080> know

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
clip on the bungee just because I know

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.510 
clip on the bungee just because I know
these<00:03:31.320> things<00:03:31.530> aren't<00:03:31.680> ridiculously<00:03:32.220> strong

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
these things aren't ridiculously strong

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.210 
these things aren't ridiculously strong
so<00:03:33.150> I'd<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.810> use<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:35.160> that

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
so I'd like to use as much of that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.680 
so I'd like to use as much of that
bungee<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.150> think<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.390> bungee<00:03:36.630> is

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
bungee as I can so I think the bungee is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.880 
bungee as I can so I think the bungee is
gonna<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> weak<00:03:37.170> point<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.800> don't<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:39.890> so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
gonna be a weak point I don't you so

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.979 
gonna be a weak point I don't you so
that's<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.580> pretty<00:03:41.910> basic<00:03:42.090> nothing<00:03:42.450> fancy

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
that's it pretty basic nothing fancy

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.090 
that's it pretty basic nothing fancy
cost<00:03:43.680> me

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
cost me

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.449 
cost me
