00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
done on there and you can see nothing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
done on there and you can see nothing
next<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.470> convince<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> plastic

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
next when we convince the plastic

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.730 
next when we convince the plastic
bracket<00:01:20.850> exactly<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> same<00:01:21.990> idea<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.560> all

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bracket exactly the same idea it's all

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.460 
bracket exactly the same idea it's all
pretty<00:01:23.670> simple<00:01:25.220> okay<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.900> get<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> you've

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pretty simple okay so get that you've

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.660 
pretty simple okay so get that you've
got<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> line<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.159> instead<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:31.670> aligning

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
got a line this up instead of aligning

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.679 
got a line this up instead of aligning
dots<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.329> you've<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:34.130> two<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.670> small<00:01:35.880> ridges

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dots up you've got two very small ridges

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
dots up you've got two very small ridges
emergency<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.970> it's<00:01:38.970> tricky<00:01:39.210> you'll<00:01:39.420> see

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
emergency on that it's tricky you'll see

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.730 
emergency on that it's tricky you'll see
it<00:01:39.720> anyway<00:01:39.990> gay<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.790> on

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
it anyway gay and you just go put on

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.569 
it anyway gay and you just go put on
line<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> up

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.399 

right<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:48.729> fill<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.030> plastic<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:50.049> got<00:01:50.229> that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
right and fill the plastic you got that

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.609 
right and fill the plastic you got that
right<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.460> we've<00:01:54.549> got<00:01:54.640> two<00:01:54.850> parts<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.619> quite

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
right so we've got two parts on it quite

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.460 
right so we've got two parts on it quite
the<00:01:56.740> last<00:01:56.920> part<00:01:57.189> we<00:01:57.340> may<00:01:57.430> need<00:01:57.549> fire<00:01:58.320> yeah<00:01:59.320> we

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the last part we may need fire yeah we

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.179 
the last part we may need fire yeah we
can<00:01:59.590> use<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> blowtorch<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.560> tool

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
can use the blowtorch and use this tool

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.340 
can use the blowtorch and use this tool
here<00:02:03.430> which<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.909> my<00:02:04.090> dental<00:02:04.420> tool<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:05.200> got

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
here which is my dental tool it's got

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.400 
here which is my dental tool it's got
like<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.530> flat<00:02:05.860> rounded<00:02:06.460> bit<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.939> siding

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
like a flat rounded bit on the siding

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.509 
like a flat rounded bit on the siding
what<00:02:08.410> you're<00:02:08.530> good<00:02:08.709> have<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.069> melt<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
what you're good have to do is melt the

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.670 
what you're good have to do is melt the
pins<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.149> original<00:02:10.539> you'll<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.349> if

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
pins on the original you'll see if

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.900 
pins on the original you'll see if
you've<00:02:11.890> taken<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.160> headphone<00:02:12.400> jacks<00:02:12.610> after

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you've taken a headphone jacks after

coming out here these two bits they have

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.360 
coming out here these two bits they have
got<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> go<00:02:23.110> through<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.920> movie<00:02:24.130> switch

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
got to go through the movie switch

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.580 
got to go through the movie switch
bracket<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:25.480> their<00:02:25.660> mouth<00:02:25.900> they<00:02:26.110> melt

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
bracket and then their mouth they melt

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.620 
bracket and then their mouth they melt
on<00:02:26.860> yeah<00:02:27.120> obviously<00:02:28.120> haven't<00:02:28.390> got<00:02:28.510> an

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
on yeah obviously haven't got an

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.090 
on yeah obviously haven't got an
expensive<00:02:29.049> machine<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.620> I'm<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.040> to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
expensive machine so I'm just going to

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.330 
expensive machine so I'm just going to
keep<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:31.090> tool<00:02:31.630> up<00:02:31.870> when<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.950> goes<00:02:33.069> through

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
keep this tool up when it goes through

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.990 
keep this tool up when it goes through
and<00:02:33.959> melt<00:02:34.959> me<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.769> stays<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.640> what's

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and melt me on so it stays on and what's

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.699 
and melt me on so it stays on and what's
gonna<00:02:37.150> use<00:02:37.269> epoxy<00:02:37.510> resin<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.410> found<00:02:38.530> that's

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
gonna use epoxy resin so I found that's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
gonna use epoxy resin so I found that's
brilliant<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.239> little<00:02:40.390> bow<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.870> really

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
brilliant just a little bow of it really

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.039 
brilliant just a little bow of it really
keeps<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.769> still<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.760> gives<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.870> much

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
keeps it still and gives you a much

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.020 
keeps it still and gives you a much
better<00:02:44.349> mute<00:02:44.590> switch<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:45.819> what<00:02:45.970> you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
better mute switch and that's what you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.050 
better mute switch and that's what you
try<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.330> really<00:02:46.510> get<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> good<00:02:46.930> news<00:02:47.170> which

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
try to do really get a good news which

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.400 
try to do really get a good news which
so<00:02:50.730> right

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.780 

get<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:56.210> bracket<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.830> want<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.160> push<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
get the bracket and you want to push the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.070 
get the bracket and you want to push the
two<00:02:59.450> pins<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.550> plastic<00:03:01.970> pins<00:03:02.210> through<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
two pins the plastic pins through the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.560 
two pins the plastic pins through the
mute<00:03:03.260> bracket<00:03:05.440> okay<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.830> through<00:03:07.100> that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
mute bracket okay so that through that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:16.100 
mute bracket okay so that through that
so<00:03:08.570> it's<00:03:08.720> like

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.650 

like<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:20.070> see<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:22.070> right<00:03:23.070> through<00:03:23.430> that

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
like so you see that right through that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.500 
like so you see that right through that
the<00:03:24.740> propel<00:03:25.740> from<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.610> divide<00:03:27.090> your<00:03:27.120> little

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
the propel from you divide your little

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.970 
the propel from you divide your little
methods<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.870> doing<00:03:27.960> it<00:03:28.170> are<00:03:28.260> holy<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:28.740> this

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
methods of doing it are holy like this

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.250 
methods of doing it are holy like this
now<00:03:29.220> because<00:03:29.880> you've<00:03:30.210> gotta<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.690> pressure

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
now because you've gotta get pressure

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.370 
now because you've gotta get pressure
behind<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.850> sides<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.990> really<00:03:34.260> got

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
behind it and the sides you really got

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.650 
behind it and the sides you really got
me<00:03:34.410> pushing<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.910> pushing<00:03:36.300> down<00:03:36.330> at<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
me pushing it up and pushing down at the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.540 
me pushing it up and pushing down at the
same<00:03:36.810> time<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.290> found<00:03:37.920> there's<00:03:38.040> only<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.340> way

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
same time I found there's only one way

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.610 
same time I found there's only one way
to<00:03:38.610> get<00:03:38.850> your<00:03:38.940> fingers<00:03:39.240> round<00:03:39.390> in<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.470> how

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
to get your fingers round in this is how

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.699 
to get your fingers round in this is how
I<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:41.040> do<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.460> like<00:03:41.760> bass<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:43.470> trick

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I I do it like bass just this trick

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.900 
I I do it like bass just this trick
because<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:44.010> also<00:03:44.160> you've<00:03:44.400> got<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.670> have<00:03:44.760> one

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
because you also you've got to have one

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.410 
because you also you've got to have one
free<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.390> melt<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.040> talk<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.580> that's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
free to melt it talk about that that's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.800 
free to melt it talk about that that's
putting<00:03:48.720> fresh<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.050> their<00:03:49.280> do<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.580> this

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
putting fresh to their do is like this

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.140 
putting fresh to their do is like this
you<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.110> develop<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:53.760> some<00:03:53.880> ways<00:03:54.060> of

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
you kind of develop just some ways of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.180 
you kind of develop just some ways of
using<00:03:54.300> your<00:03:54.540> fingers<00:03:54.890> when<00:03:55.890> you're<00:03:56.040> doing

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
using your fingers when you're doing

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.500 
using your fingers when you're doing
this<00:03:56.280> sort<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.550> stuff<00:03:58.730> blow<00:03:59.730> towards<00:04:02.510> just

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
this sort of stuff blow towards just

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.640 
this sort of stuff blow towards just
gonna<00:04:03.600> heat<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.930> up<00:04:04.250> cuz<00:04:05.250> rad<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:07.440> like

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
gonna heat this up cuz rad it's like

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.020 
gonna heat this up cuz rad it's like
cool<00:04:07.950> ever<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.400> slightly<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:08.850> I'm<00:04:08.940> gonna

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
cool ever so slightly then I'm gonna

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.110 
cool ever so slightly then I'm gonna
push<00:04:09.239> against<00:04:09.570> these<00:04:09.750> pins<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.850> we're<00:04:12.000> gonna

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
push against these pins and we're gonna

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.599 
push against these pins and we're gonna
have<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.270> really<00:04:12.570> nice<00:04:13.400> bracket

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.999 

one<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> heat<00:04:20.169> really<00:04:20.439> transpose

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
one and the heat really transpose

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.959 
one and the heat really transpose
quickly<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.969> know<00:04:22.659> you<00:04:22.719> kind<00:04:23.199> of<00:04:23.819> run<00:04:24.819> your

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
quickly so you know you kind of run your

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:35.219 
quickly so you know you kind of run your
fingers<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.270> bit<00:04:25.449> for<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:26.229> it<00:04:26.409> is<00:04:30.240> less<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:34.229> try

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
fingers a bit for so it is less then try

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.429 
fingers a bit for so it is less then try
and<00:04:35.349> share<00:04:35.469> this<00:04:35.620> with<00:04:36.039> all<00:04:36.810> right<00:04:37.810> let's<00:04:38.289> have

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
and share this with all right let's have

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:48.670 
and share this with all right let's have
a<00:04:38.469> look<00:04:42.840> focus<00:04:43.840> on<00:04:44.020> this

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.360 

mmm<00:04:49.639> pretty<00:04:50.419> rubbish<00:04:50.630> can<00:04:51.050> see<00:04:51.289> but<00:04:51.949> now<00:04:52.130> this

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
mmm pretty rubbish can see but now this

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.150 
mmm pretty rubbish can see but now this
is<00:04:52.550> perfect<00:04:53.240> well<00:04:53.509> he's<00:04:54.020> bonded<00:04:54.560> onto<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.979> now

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.659

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
that see the two black flats today with

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.760 
that see the two black flats today with
pins<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.900> now<00:05:03.440> they're<00:05:03.650> melted<00:05:04.009> on<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
pins and now they're melted on to the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.189 
pins and now they're melted on to the
bracket<00:05:07.479> you'll<00:05:08.479> see<00:05:08.630> what<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.780> mean<00:05:08.840> if<00:05:09.080> you've

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
bracket you'll see what I mean if you've

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.700 
bracket you'll see what I mean if you've
got<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.410> stuff<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.100> they're<00:05:10.220> melted<00:05:10.610> now

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
got the stuff so they're melted now

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.060 
got the stuff so they're melted now
which<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:12.740> cool<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.940> then<00:05:14.620> could<00:05:15.620> use<00:05:15.800> some<00:05:15.979> of

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
which is cool and then could use some of

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.219 
which is cool and then could use some of
that<00:05:16.100> epoxy<00:05:16.490> resin<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:17.060> just<00:05:17.300> now<00:05:17.479> if<00:05:18.050> as

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
that epoxy resin that I just now if as

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.700 
that epoxy resin that I just now if as
an<00:05:18.350> ardent<00:05:18.770> it's<00:05:19.370> nearly<00:05:19.789> upset<00:05:19.970> now<00:05:20.560> so<00:05:21.560> what

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
an ardent it's nearly upset now so what

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.760 
an ardent it's nearly upset now so what
I<00:05:21.740> have<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:21.919> do<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.220> bit<00:05:22.430> extra<00:05:23.530> there's<00:05:24.530> a<00:05:24.590> few

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
I have to do a bit extra there's a few

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.140 
I have to do a bit extra there's a few
little<00:05:24.949> bit<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.370> then<00:05:25.490> I'll<00:05:25.550> just<00:05:25.729> put<00:05:25.970> that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
little bit and then I'll just put that

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:35.100 
little bit and then I'll just put that
on<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.419> edge<00:05:27.280> optical<00:05:28.280> epoxy<00:05:28.729> resin<00:05:30.400> on<00:05:31.400> those

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.529 

camera<00:05:36.110> there<00:05:37.070> I'll<00:05:37.880> put<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:38.180> on<00:05:38.240> those<00:05:38.389> two

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
camera there I'll put it on those two

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.999 
camera there I'll put it on those two
black<00:05:38.750> eyes<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:39.139> saw<00:05:39.229> just<00:05:39.500> now<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.860> to

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
black eyes that saw just now just to

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.180 
black eyes that saw just now just to
really<00:05:40.310> make<00:05:40.550> sure<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:40.910> good<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:42.800> really

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
really make sure it's good that really

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.659 
really make sure it's good that really
is<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> headphone<00:05:43.669> jack<00:05:43.849> so<00:05:43.880> again<00:05:44.300> just<00:05:45.669> cool

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
is the headphone jack so again just cool

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.270 
is the headphone jack so again just cool
then<00:05:47.919> complete<00:05:48.919> people<00:05:49.729> don't<00:05:49.910> circuit
