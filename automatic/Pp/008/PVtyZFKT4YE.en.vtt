00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 one 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.869
 his work 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.409
 acz 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.130
 another spanish version 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.830
 pain is the conscious and unpleasant perception that some factor that 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.870
 is affecting the integrity of our organism 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.910
 So it turns out to be an effective protection mechanism 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.900
 because before the painful warning we try to quickly suppress the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.610
 people who produce it 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.120
 the pain may be poignant like the one we feel when we get a puncture 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.160
 burning characterized by its great intensity 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.230
 or continuous that is perceived internally since it responds to internal factors such as 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.249
 for example the inflammation of some acute fourth stop organ 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.450
 Colombia 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.140
 the one who always complained about 100 dollars 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.880
 the contact with a warm object produces a pleasant sensation 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 if the temperature increases the sensation is transformed into heat that reaches 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.890
 become pain if a burn occurs 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.430
 This is possible because in all our tissues, especially in the skin 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.820
 there are special receivers 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.320
 united to end nerve endings capable of perceiving different 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.440
 sensations 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.930
 such as temperature pressure rugosity str 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.000
 when the stimulation of said receptors is very intense 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 that becomes pain 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 the nerve fibers transmit the information from the receptors to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 the central area of ​​the spinal cord before the records 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.930
 from the spinal cord heat is transmitted to the central nervous system 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.030
 the information received is integrated and elaborated as a painful sensation in a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.490
 brain nucleus called thalamus 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 a few years ago an amazing discovery was made 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.629
 In the interior of the nervous system there are cells capable of 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.769
 Chemical substances designed to reduce pain 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:22.279
 apparently these substances that were called endorphins 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.319
 act on the nerve fibers of the marrow and the brain 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.159
 decreasing the amount of painful information 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.159
 from the three affected sectors 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.439
 is 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.369
 but no more clear
