00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.870 
will actually two major gripes about the
Nexus<00:01:41.759> S<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> lack<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> micro<00:01:43.079> SD<00:01:43.439> card<00:01:43.710> support

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
Nexus S is lack of micro SD card support

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.080 
Nexus S is lack of micro SD card support
me<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.229> person<00:01:46.229> who<00:01:46.290> has<00:01:46.380> never<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.090> device

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
me a person who has never had a device

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
me a person who has never had a device
that's<00:01:48.149> had<00:01:48.570> over<00:01:48.869> eight<00:01:49.049> gigabytes<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that's had over eight gigabytes of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.700 
that's had over eight gigabytes of
storage<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:51.570> 16<00:01:51.899> gigabytes<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.409> just

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
storage I think 16 gigabytes is just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.709 
storage I think 16 gigabytes is just
fine<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> lot<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> people<00:01:55.110> who<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
fine but for a lot of people who have a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
fine but for a lot of people who have a
lot<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> music<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.500> movies<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
lot of music and movies and all that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700 
lot of music and movies and all that
kind<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> stuff<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.360> guess<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.200> could<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.439> correct

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
kind of stuff I guess I could be correct

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.920 
kind of stuff I guess I could be correct
and<00:02:01.829> another<00:02:02.159> thing<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.090> no<00:02:03.920> 720p<00:02:04.920> recording

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and another thing is a no 720p recording

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.510 
and another thing is a no 720p recording
it<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> 5<00:02:07.439> megapixel<00:02:07.590> camera<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.310> flash

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it is a 5 megapixel camera with flash

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.260 
it is a 5 megapixel camera with flash
but<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> has<00:02:09.149> no<00:02:11.300> 720p<00:02:12.300> recording

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
but it has no 720p recording

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.180 
but it has no 720p recording
some<00:02:13.900> people<00:02:14.170> say<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.920> that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
some people say that it's just that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.550 
some people say that it's just that
gingerbread<00:02:16.120> doesn't<00:02:16.810> support<00:02:17.110> 720p

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
gingerbread doesn't support 720p

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.250 
gingerbread doesn't support 720p
recording<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.150> think<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.840> more<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.110> an

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
recording but I think it was more of an

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.490 
recording but I think it was more of an
issue<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.950> internal<00:02:21.310> storage<00:02:21.790> oh<00:02:22.500> well

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
issue with the internal storage oh well

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.170 
issue with the internal storage oh well
guess<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.890> sort<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.220> showed<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
guess I sort of showed you that to you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.770 
guess I sort of showed you that to you
guys<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:27.010> don't<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:27.940> credit<00:02:28.450> service

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
guys so I don't have that credit service

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.360 
guys so I don't have that credit service
at<00:02:28.990> two<00:02:29.860> bars<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.310> 3g<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.330> got<00:02:31.590> 2.1<00:02:32.590> for

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
at two bars on 3g but I got 2.1 for

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.990 
at two bars on 3g but I got 2.1 for
megabits<00:02:33.880> per<00:02:33.940> second<00:02:34.390> download<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.000> point

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
megabits per second download and point

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.530 
megabits per second download and point
five<00:02:37.240> seven<00:02:37.630> megabits<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.260> upload<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
five seven megabits on upload and I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.780 
five seven megabits on upload and I
guess<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.830> was<00:02:41.920> more<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.280> storage<00:02:42.670> issue

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
guess that was more of a storage issue

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.730 
guess that was more of a storage issue
more<00:02:43.270> than<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.850> guess<00:02:45.850> hardware<00:02:46.450> issue<00:02:46.740> that

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
more than a I guess hardware issue that

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.120 
more than a I guess hardware issue that
makes<00:02:47.890> any<00:02:48.010> sense<00:02:48.130> oh<00:02:48.490> okay<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:49.770> round<00:02:50.770> back<00:02:50.950> we

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
makes any sense oh okay so round back we

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.020 
makes any sense oh okay so round back we
have<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> 1500<00:02:52.240> milliamp<00:02:52.630> battery<00:02:53.640> right<00:02:54.640> there

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
have a 1500 milliamp battery right there

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.270 
have a 1500 milliamp battery right there
I<00:02:55.360> know<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.050> can<00:02:56.200> see<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.560> probably<00:02:57.130> not

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
I know if you can see that probably not

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.630 
I know if you can see that probably not
and<00:02:57.550> right<00:02:58.390> here<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.990> one<00:02:59.740> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.950> selling

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
and right here is one of the selling

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.720 
and right here is one of the selling
points<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.180> Nexus<00:03:01.540> S<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.930> guess<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:03.010> right

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
points of the Nexus S I guess this right

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.370 
points of the Nexus S I guess this right
there<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.090> back<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.510> see<00:03:04.540> those<00:03:04.840> contacts

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
there on the back you see those contacts

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.940 
there on the back you see those contacts
right<00:03:06.370> there<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.570> an<00:03:07.720> NFC<00:03:08.200> chip<00:03:08.410> NFC

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
right there this is an NFC chip NFC

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400 
right there this is an NFC chip NFC
stands<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.400> Near<00:03:09.940> Field<00:03:09.970> Communication<00:03:10.410> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
stands for Near Field Communication and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.710 
stands for Near Field Communication and
what<00:03:11.740> that<00:03:11.920> means<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.370> odd<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
what that means is odd you can in the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.470 
what that means is odd you can in the
future<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.770> hasn't<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.520> took<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.210> off<00:03:16.330> in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
future it hasn't really took it off in

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.120 
future it hasn't really took it off in
the<00:03:16.570> US<00:03:16.870> in<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.350> future<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:17.860> use<00:03:17.980> your

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
the US in the future you can use your

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.400 
the US in the future you can use your
phone<00:03:18.280> almost<00:03:18.520> as<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> credit<00:03:19.120> card<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:20.230> can

phone almost as a credit card you can
just<00:03:20.560> set<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.450> will<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.800> know<00:03:23.920> pay

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
just set it on and it will you know pay

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the build quality on the Nexus S isn't

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.640 
the build quality on the Nexus S isn't
as<00:03:28.120> good<00:03:28.270> as<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> nexus<00:03:28.840> one<00:03:29.080> because<00:03:29.470> it's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
as good as the nexus one because it's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.690 
as good as the nexus one because it's
this<00:03:31.200> glossy<00:03:32.200> plastic<00:03:32.530> that's<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.459> real

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
this glossy plastic that's a real

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.990 
this glossy plastic that's a real
fingerprint<00:03:34.450> magnet<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:35.170> don't<00:03:35.800> seem<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.790> like

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
fingerprint magnet I don't seem to like

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.199 
fingerprint magnet I don't seem to like
it<00:03:37.030> as<00:03:37.540> much<00:03:37.600> as<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.050> next<00:03:38.080> one<00:03:38.580> also<00:03:39.580> on<00:03:39.910> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
it as much as the next one also on the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.150 
it as much as the next one also on the
front<00:03:40.480> we<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.870> front-facing<00:03:41.350> vga<00:03:41.590> camera

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
front we have a front-facing vga camera

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.630 
front we have a front-facing vga camera
oh<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:44.320> normally<00:03:44.830> would<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.010> would<00:03:45.610> you

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
oh it's normally would you would you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.350 
oh it's normally would you would you
would<00:03:45.880> expect<00:03:46.240> from<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.510> VGA<00:03:47.140> camera<00:03:47.470> oh<00:03:48.360> also

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
would expect from a VGA camera oh also

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.330 
would expect from a VGA camera oh also
four<00:03:50.080> inch<00:03:50.230> Super<00:03:50.530> AMOLED<00:03:51.180> display<00:03:53.160> right<00:03:54.160> now

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
four inch Super AMOLED display right now

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.130 
four inch Super AMOLED display right now
I<00:03:54.370> thought<00:03:54.700> I'd<00:03:54.790> give<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.090> guys<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:55.360> quick

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
I thought I'd give you guys a quick

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.410 
I thought I'd give you guys a quick
benchmark<00:03:56.709> since<00:03:57.010> now<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.580> quadrant<00:03:58.060> does

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
benchmark since now that quadrant does

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.449 
benchmark since now that quadrant does
support<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:59.020> your<00:03:59.050> bread<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.560> know<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.430> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
support in your bread I know in the

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.880 
support in your bread I know in the
early<00:04:00.550> Nexus<00:04:01.209> videos<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.959> didn't<00:04:02.290> crash

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
early Nexus videos that it didn't crash

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.760 
early Nexus videos that it didn't crash
or<00:04:03.250> whatever<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:03.990> so<00:04:04.990> it's<00:04:05.230> from<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.590> full

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
or whatever and so it's from the full

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.320 
or whatever and so it's from the full
benchmark<00:04:06.280> oh<00:04:06.490> no<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.000> benchmark<00:04:07.450> has<00:04:07.570> run<00:04:07.810> I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
benchmark oh no the benchmark has run I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.790 
benchmark oh no the benchmark has run I
it<00:04:10.330> says<00:04:10.720> my<00:04:11.650> device<00:04:11.860> nexus<00:04:12.730> s<00:04:12.910> got<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.709> 1004<00:04:14.709> and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
it says my device nexus s got a 1004 and

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.060 
it says my device nexus s got a 1004 and
31<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.209> barely<00:04:16.540> outperforms<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> nexus

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
31 so it barely outperforms the nexus

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.820 
31 so it barely outperforms the nexus
one<00:04:18.340> running<00:04:18.790> 2.2<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.750> above<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:22.110> this<00:04:23.110> device

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
one running 2.2 and above so this device

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.590 
one running 2.2 and above so this device
is<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.160> really<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.400> powerhouse<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.210> what<00:04:25.510> it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
is it really a powerhouse but what it

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.540 
is it really a powerhouse but what it
does<00:04:25.810> have

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
does have

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.100 
does have
is<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.750> very<00:04:27.750> powerful<00:04:28.050> GPU<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:30.180> will<00:04:30.389> show

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
is a very powerful GPU and I will show

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800 
is a very powerful GPU and I will show
you<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.289> with<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.770> quick<00:04:32.099> run<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.490> new<00:04:32.669> core<00:04:33.030> so

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.430 
but i think the it only got 59.5 because
that's<00:06:43.940> a<00:06:44.030> software<00:06:44.480> cap<00:06:44.750> I<00:06:44.930> honestly<00:06:45.140> think

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
that's a software cap I honestly think

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.160 
that's a software cap I honestly think
it<00:06:45.590> would<00:06:45.680> do<00:06:45.770> much<00:06:45.920> better<00:06:46.900> another<00:06:47.900> great

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
it would do much better another great

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.320 
it would do much better another great
thing<00:06:48.230> about<00:06:48.590> this<00:06:49.310> is<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.760> it<00:06:50.030> comes<00:06:50.240> with
