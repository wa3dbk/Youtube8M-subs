00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello I am being and this is what today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.730
 talking alone 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.560
 and today is how to paint your nails 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.410
 newspaper is super easy the only thing that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.020
 you are going to need are pieces of paper 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.300
 you look for them on the sheet of paper 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.099
 but try to cut small 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.770
 bits that are to the thing that they have 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.950
 as pure letters avoid the images you go 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.079
 to need a clear color varnish 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.540
 I'm going to use a pastel pink that uses 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.870
 as very discreet a varnish that gives 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.450
 shine is to keep a pair of scissors with 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.210
 a little boat with alcohol the first thing 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:55.160
 you have to do is paint your nails with 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:57.200
 a color that is clear since you have the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.450
 painted nails wait a few minutes to 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.310
 to dry completely and we are not going to 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.590
 applying any layer of gloss or of 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.059
 dryer or anything you're going to leave alone with 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.090
 the enamel that is thing that you use 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.010
 Then you are going to put a coruÃ±a wedge 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.470
 little boat with alcohol 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.770
 soaking until it moistens 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.070
 completely and you are going to hit the piece 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.590
 of newspaper on the nail you go to 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.170
 press approximately 20 or 30 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 seconds you take the newspaper and the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.500
 stamping of the letters will remain 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.540
 boarding in the enamel of the unne 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.490
 you can apply a little alcohol 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.040
 extra so the newspaper fits 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.730
 damp 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.890
 and now they are going to withdraw the newspaper 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.930
 and in this way 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.600
 the letters are impregnated in the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.870
 enamel and so they will do with each 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870
 a 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.410
 where to finish you're going to apply a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.240
 shine coat or dryer and your dreams 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.040
 they will be decorated in a very 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.040
 easy and the truth is that it looks easy 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.590
 outputs to the nails grow faster 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.569
 according to the hand you use for example 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.310
 if you are right-handed like me 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.379
 your nails grow much faster in the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.060
 right hand that in the left hand and 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.349
 If you are fat your nails will grow with 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.659
 much more speed in the left hand 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.400
 in the right hand and well I hope that 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.870
