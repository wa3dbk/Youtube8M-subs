00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
at my house at anyway I happen to have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.410 
at my house at anyway I happen to have
several<00:01:13.409> outlets<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.520> operated<00:01:15.240> by<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
several outlets that are operated by a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
several outlets that are operated by a
light<00:01:15.659> switch<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.549> have

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
light switch so you kind of can have

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
light switch so you kind of can have
that<00:01:17.880> dual<00:01:18.090> functionality<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.500> can

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that dual functionality there you can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.740 
that dual functionality there you can
use<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> iphone<00:01:20.909> app<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> turn<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.570> your

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
use the iphone app to turn on your

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
use the iphone app to turn on your
switch<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:22.619> turns<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.759> outlet

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
switch which then turns on your outlet

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600 
switch which then turns on your outlet
on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.540> wall<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.340> mean<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.430> very

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
on the wall and I mean it's very

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.590 
on the wall and I mean it's very
convenient<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.689> when<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.820> much<00:01:29.850> will

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
convenient and so when and how much will

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
convenient and so when and how much will
this<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.930> available<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:31.979> be

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this be available for so this will be

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
this be available for so this will be
4999<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.270> same<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> basic<00:01:34.290> Wemo<00:01:34.590> switch

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
4999 the same as the basic Wemo switch

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.679 
4999 the same as the basic Wemo switch
and<00:01:35.220> it'll<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.430> coming<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.909> summer<00:01:36.090> well

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and it'll be coming out this summer well

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
and it'll be coming out this summer well
there<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.200> additional<00:01:37.439> add-ons<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> like
