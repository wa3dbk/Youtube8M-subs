00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.790
 yes hello i am fan and i show it 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 the simplest of the simple ones 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.240
 namely how to meet body 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 It really feels like a patient for yourself 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 beginners because they do not have to much 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 The small ones are done by themselves 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.130
 a hole in the recipe is quite 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 simply we take 100 grams of white 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.980
 chocolate 100 grams of dark chocolate 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.840
 We weigh and cream 70 grams off the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 The filling we do now is called 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.329
 a ghana and a good taste 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 we will then give 30 grams 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.489
 Belize is important for us that the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 bring cream to a boil 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.390
 The chocolate should be melted 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 especially when cooking small quantities 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 then we add the hot cream 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.769
 stir it all together when you get one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.869
 wants to have a particularly creamy taste 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.030
 you can stir in butter 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.439
 but you should stir that up until 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.659
 she is completely melted when she is 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.689
 then they are done simply enter yet 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 baileys to about 30 grams is one 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 Good amount so that you can do it well 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.040
 Tastes and stir well too 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.040
 until the ghanaer is able to flow 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 we take now an insight 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.050
 injection bag I imagine the always in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.760
 Such a glass can and then gives the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.760
 liquid ganache inside 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.540
 Now I take the bag prank 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.970
 again the very down with it 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.560
 it's clean at the top so it's good here 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.350
 can close by hand 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.979
 I dare the bag so that I am with 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.289
 Print on the bag as well as not at all 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.860
 can squirt out and cut now 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:13.110
 just down the top off well and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.450
 Now I go to each praline individually 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.110
 string and fill them to just below the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.060
 The important thing is that they are not too high 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.280
 but also not close too low 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.799
 we still need room for one upstairs 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.049
 small chocolate blanket but if that 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.080
 space is too big we have one too 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.090
 big lump of chocolate in between 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.130
 let's shake that ganache really 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.239
 beautiful all corners flows that they no 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.319
 have bubbles and then if necessary 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.299
 splash again on it 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.420
 yes I'll take a self-rolled one 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.260
 sprits bag and I'm doing something 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.260
 tempered a chocolate 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.360
 close it from above 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.360
 and just cut the little one down 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.360
 tip off 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.800
 and now I just close the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.910
 praline by going circular over the 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.910
 opening over it go 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.420
 yes, we are now hawking the devil in what 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.610
 dip them in tempered chocolate 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.710
 and then on a hedgehog grid 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.540
 lay 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.070
 after one to two minutes is the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.840
 already a bit tight and chocolate 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.820
 then roll in just left and right 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.650
 over the grid over and so arises 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.650
 then a nice idea structure 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.590
 Well hollow balls you can do nowadays very much 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.320
 Just buy one can send oneself 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.570
 let the always come in places with 63 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.440
 piece and pay attention to it when buying 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.450
 that the balls are really fresh and 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.500
 You can also just give a lesson 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.930
 eat to test the chocolate because 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.370
 You can tell by the taste of the chocolate 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.080
 then whether it's a good one 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.750
 Quality is great here 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.460
 quality differences that you only notice 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.400
 if you actually ate them 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.320
 the balls are down to above have 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.120
 a hole I cut now even one on 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.040
 that they simply see it as thick 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.080
 Of course this is a very fast one 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.710
 and comfortable style pralines fast 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.000
 very very simple but they do 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.650
 of course always have a thick 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.750
 chocolate case you once have the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.370
 Cover of the ball itself and next to it 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.710
 a second layer if you have it 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.750
 cover with self-cast 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.970
 chocolates form the layer extremely thin 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.180
 and of course much fresher if 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.160
 They themselves enjoyed these balls 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.780
 are here in plastic stored by 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.440
 Of course, they are also well protected 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.800
 Do not break so easily and that is 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.000
 actually the method of industrial 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.200
 but mass production for them as 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200
 Beginner very comfortable
