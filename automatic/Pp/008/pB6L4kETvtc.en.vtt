00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello olive jÃ©gou I am 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.849
 farmer with trammargat and we've been 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.400
 contacted by the general council 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.420
 so it's been three years now for 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 make a sheep grazing test on the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.000
 moors of locarno so very low four 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 classes kilometers away from the site of the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 heaths which our goal is so we 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 is two with two farmers so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
 to watch Lake Geneva and in two months 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.620
 and so we mix two flocks 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.829
 is part of our skin and we 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 brings 80 ewes alone and on sales 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.410
 from locarn 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.329
 the goal being for both of us 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.329
 show that we can 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.570
 campus convoy how maybe 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 installed young people on a pasture 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.510
 moors 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.950
 and then we thought it was more 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 to pass for farmers who was 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.940
 already well in place to do 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.920
 the experimentation that is found 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.670
 today that last three years that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.670
 to give you that's to do 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.260
 pass on the relay on people finally by 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.040
 for farmers who themselves 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.040
 would rather be on zone 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.880
 so in fact we do not know at the end of 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.770
 three years if we will continue or if 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.470
 it will be taken by others so 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.550
 our goal is so well in 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.310
 the collective interest 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.410
 the export of media end of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.760
 maintenance of the environment but especially to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.590
 we farmers are 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:51.490
 able to install other farmers 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:53.590
 maybe with a label or a markdown 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.270
 on the momentum of the ocades instead of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 the lamb from monday so I'm 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 strong enough I'm responsible for ensuring the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.880
 monitoring vegetation under pressure 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 grazing with the breeders things 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.350
 went very well we could 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.140
 discuss do meetings and but 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.180
 especially be on the ground and expect 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 from year to year 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 what we could change to evolve 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.830
 and we had very 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.280
 interesting very fruitful for me 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.920
 it was very interesting to know the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.420
 their imperatives or in any case what he 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.170
 was it necessary to take into account 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.050
 and then from my side can give them 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.870
 also the criteria that allowed me to 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.900
 the decline is down very well between 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.450
 and improve so and then it's very 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 nice atmosphere very lenient has 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.900
 keep on going
