00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:14.340
 so this here is none other than 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.370
 the element with the panel of the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.250
 smart 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.670
 where there is precisely the air conditioner 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:28.040
 this one in the back window spin 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.800
 parking signal and safe 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.840
 goalkeeper 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.250
 then here I have already dismantled the piece already 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.730
 changed the light bulb, however 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.140
 I wanted to show you how in case you are 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.960
 he realized he couldn't see anymore 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 the lighting of the fabric or better 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.420
 of the heating of the old smart 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.820
 like you just need to change this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.620
 light bulb here that I am struck 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.239
 because this light bulb which does nothing else 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.360
 who wait to distribute 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.280
 enlightenment within this channel 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.730
 I don't know if it looks good in there to which 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.150
 in the midst of these two elements of 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.650
 plastic does nothing but distribute 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.710
 in light precisely at the controls of the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.229
 smart heating 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 so I've already changed lives 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.170
 be careful that to disassemble the bulb 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.870
 it is necessary to intervene on these three screws 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.790
 here number 1 2 and 3 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.700
 through the classic screwdriver a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.240
 stellina in this case the number is a 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.310
 anti seven once elevated precisely 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.980
 these three Berardi vines to this 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.780
 but plastic panels 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.530
 furthermore, the card will come out 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.960
 electronic attention that once 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.080
 when the electronic card is removed it will fall out 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.650
 all the buttons so then you need to 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.530
 be careful enough in the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.340
 reassembly proceeding to insert 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.330
 button holding the door vertically 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.150
 button with one hand then insects of the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.060
 card and making it fit into these 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.060
 two holes and then insert the panels 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.700
 I was not in the appropriate joints e 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.570
 rehabilitate everything 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:31.980
 let's just try the bulb 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:36.870
 functions ok and working we insert the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:47.480
 cables inside the push-button panel is assembled 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:51.420
 thus setting these two together 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.440
 notches in the appropriate joints here and 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.850
 then doing back prevailed 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.860
 attention that the brush for 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.290
 to disassemble it must be levered with a 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.290
 small screwdriver so backwards
