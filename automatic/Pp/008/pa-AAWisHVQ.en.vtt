picture the damp it and this is a

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.819 
picture the damp it and this is a
humidity<00:00:48.629> indicator<00:00:48.930> card<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
humidity indicator card kind of like a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.670 
humidity indicator card kind of like a
hydrometer<00:00:50.690> I've<00:00:51.690> heard<00:00:51.930> these<00:00:52.050> things<00:00:52.110> are

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hydrometer I've heard these things are

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
hydrometer I've heard these things are
very<00:00:52.739> inaccurate<00:00:53.520> though<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
very inaccurate though it just kind of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
very inaccurate though it just kind of
gives<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.379> rough<00:00:55.590> sense<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
gives you a really rough sense of the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
gives you a really rough sense of the
humidity<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.670> room<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> truthfully<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
humidity in the room and truthfully I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.220 
humidity in the room and truthfully I
can't<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:59.010> figure<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.460> how<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.199> read<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
can't really figure out how to read it

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.399 
can't really figure out how to read it
properly<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
properly and then you have the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
properly and then you have the
instructions<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:06.590> then<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
instructions and then you have the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450 
instructions and then you have the
humidifier<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.439> basically<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
humidifier so basically all this is is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.469 
humidifier so basically all this is is
there's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> long<00:01:12.540> skinny<00:01:13.170> sponge<00:01:14.210> inside<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
there's a long skinny sponge inside of a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.789 
there's a long skinny sponge inside of a
rubber<00:01:15.799> housing<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.340> small<00:01:18.090> holes<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.680> got

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
rubber housing with small holes it's got

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
of musicians I think I've found three

of musicians I think I've found three
downsides<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.760> product<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:16.320> first<00:03:16.560> one

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
downsides to this product the first one

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.600 
downsides to this product the first one
being<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.830> has<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> potential<00:03:20.460> to

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
being that it it has the potential to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.790 
being that it it has the potential to
leak<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.600> body<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.930> your<00:03:22.050> guitar<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.770> know

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
all it is like I said is a sponge inside

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.440 
all it is like I said is a sponge inside
of<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.530> rubber<00:03:25.800> housing<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.460> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.210> don't

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.770 
of this rubber housing and if you don't
bring<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.960> out<00:03:28.200> well<00:03:29.510> then<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:33.330> water<00:03:33.540> can

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
bring it out well then the water can

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.590 
bring it out well then the water can
seep<00:03:33.810> out<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.260> these<00:03:34.380> small<00:03:34.680> holes<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.600> get

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
seep out of these small holes and get

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the second would be the fact that the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.250 
the second would be the fact that the
only<00:03:44.010> way<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:44.460> use<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.930> have<00:03:46.140> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
only way to really use it is to have it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.660 
only way to really use it is to have it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
know it doesn't really do a lot of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.640 
know it doesn't really do a lot of
