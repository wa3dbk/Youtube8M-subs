okay<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.829> doing<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.520> FX<00:00:03.230> 6100<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
okay I'm doing this on the FX 6100 and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay I'm doing this on the FX 6100 and
we'll<00:00:05.160> get<00:00:05.310> right<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.670> I'll<00:00:05.850> try<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> make

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
we'll get right to it I'll try to make

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.610 
we'll get right to it I'll try to make
this<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.750> lot<00:00:06.930> quicker<00:00:07.170> than<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.500> other

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
this video a lot quicker than the other

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
this video a lot quicker than the other
ones<00:00:07.970> will<00:00:08.970> zero<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:10.400> I<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.210> clocked

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
ones will zero in I have it clocked

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.609 
ones will zero in I have it clocked
right<00:00:12.719> now<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.440> 5.0<00:00:14.809> the<00:00:15.809> volts<00:00:16.109> again<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.529> in

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
right now at 5.0 the volts again are in

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
right now at 5.0 the volts again are in
the<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.949> five<00:00:17.369> range<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.029> where<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.390> at

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the one five range is where it's at

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230 
the one five range is where it's at
right<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:19.100> temperature<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:21.060> about

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
right now temperature it's right about

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.990 
right now temperature it's right about
14<00:00:21.720> Celsius<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.500> idle<00:00:22.859> obviously<00:00:23.460> no<00:00:23.580> load<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
14 Celsius at idle obviously no load so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.689 
14 Celsius at idle obviously no load so
it's<00:00:24.150> cool<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.710> what<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it's cool and what we're gonna do is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.080 
it's cool and what we're gonna do is
this<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> we'll<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.550> ahead<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.789> run

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
this back out and we'll go ahead and run

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.620 
this back out and we'll go ahead and run
a<00:00:30.359> test<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.210> compares<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
a test on it to see how it compares to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.939 
a test on it to see how it compares to
the<00:00:33.840> 965

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.850 

go<00:00:43.670> ahead

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.160 

I<00:00:51.570> always<00:00:52.570> forget<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:52.990> turn<00:00:53.230> my<00:00:53.350> light<00:00:53.530> off

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:24.020 

this<00:00:57.859> is<00:00:58.010> clocked<00:00:58.280> at<00:00:58.429> 5.0

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.470 

see<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.080> faster<00:01:25.680> than<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
see it's going a little faster than the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:02:10.480 
see it's going a little faster than the
the<00:01:27.480> 4100<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.220> FX<00:01:29.550> 4100<00:01:33.800> which<00:01:34.800> it<00:01:34.980> better

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

okay<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.440> see<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.740> ran<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> four<00:02:16.910> point

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
okay and you can see it ran a four point

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.400 
okay and you can see it ran a four point
seven<00:02:17.960> one<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> scroll<00:02:22.490> down<00:02:23.410> look

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
seven one and if you scroll down look

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.710 
seven one and if you scroll down look
I'm<00:02:24.590> sorry<00:02:25.960> if<00:02:26.960> there<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.350> it's<00:02:27.530> at<00:02:27.650> 5.0<00:02:28.720> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
I'm sorry if there it is it's at 5.0 and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.900 
I'm sorry if there it is it's at 5.0 and
they<00:02:29.780> ran<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:29.990> four<00:02:30.560> seven<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.100> there<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.580> go

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
they ran a four seven one there you go

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.820 
they ran a four seven one there you go
so<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.630> here<00:02:32.750> what<00:02:32.900> I'm<00:02:32.960> going<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.110> do<00:02:33.230> is

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
so from here what I'm going to do is

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.460 
so from here what I'm going to do is
swing<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.430> over<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.480> what<00:02:38.750> I'll<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.290> these

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
swing it over and what I'll do is these

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.590 
swing it over and what I'll do is these
are<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.740> different<00:02:40.180> benches<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.450> ran<00:02:43.600> let

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
are the different benches that I ran let

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.110 
are the different benches that I ran let
me<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:44.840> adjust<00:02:44.960> the<00:02:45.320> camera<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:46.010> want<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> make

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
me just adjust the camera I want to make

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.530 
me just adjust the camera I want to make
sure<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.360> guys<00:02:47.450> can<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.990> up<00:02:50.530> okay<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.540> so

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
sure you guys can see it up okay so so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.020 
sure you guys can see it up okay so so
what<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.690> did<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.290> test<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:55.030> Cinebench

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
what I did with the test is Cinebench

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.900 
what I did with the test is Cinebench
eleven<00:02:56.990> point<00:02:57.170> five<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.650> here<00:02:57.860> 3dmark<00:02:58.490> oh<00:02:58.640> six

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
eleven point five is here 3dmark oh six

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.990 
eleven point five is here 3dmark oh six
is<00:02:59.060> over<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.360> other<00:02:59.390> side<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.970> see

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
is over the other side and you can see

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.920 
is over the other side and you can see
at<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.330> stock<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.260> three<00:03:03.530> point<00:03:03.770> three<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:05.690> it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
at a stock at a three point three in it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.390 
at a stock at a three point three in it
of<00:03:06.050> course<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.380> turbos<00:03:06.650> itself<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.220> got<00:03:07.370> a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
of course the turbos itself up you got a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.480 
of course the turbos itself up you got a
four<00:03:07.880> point<00:03:08.450> oh<00:03:08.540> six<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.800> actually<00:03:10.010> went

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
four point oh six so it actually went

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.780 
four point oh six so it actually went
the<00:03:10.700> same<00:03:10.910> speed<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:12.410> Phenom<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.980> 965

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the same speed is a the Phenom the 965

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.140 
the same speed is a the Phenom the 965
clocked<00:03:14.630> at<00:03:14.750> three<00:03:14.960> point<00:03:15.260> four<00:03:15.700> okay<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:16.730> it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
clocked at three point four okay so it

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.570 
clocked at three point four okay so it
had<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.020> same<00:03:18.260> when<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.710> comes<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.220> bench<00:03:19.430> it

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
had the same when it comes in a bench it

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.360 
had the same when it comes in a bench it
claw<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.030> did<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.270> exact<00:03:20.600> same<00:03:20.630> thing<00:03:21.370> from

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
claw it did the exact same thing from

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.070 
claw it did the exact same thing from
there<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.640> overclocked<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.450> rate<00:03:23.570> up<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.720> four

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
there I overclocked a rate up to four

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.320 
there I overclocked a rate up to four
gig<00:03:24.350> stock<00:03:25.040> voltage<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.730> didn't<00:03:25.910> touch<00:03:26.060> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
gig stock voltage so I didn't touch the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.320 
gig stock voltage so I didn't touch the
just<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.720> multiplier<00:03:27.140> no<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.620> extra<00:03:27.920> voltage

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
just a multiplier no that extra voltage

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.480 
just a multiplier no that extra voltage
you<00:03:29.330> can<00:03:29.360> see<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.690> did<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> 450<00:03:30.530> when<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.340> look

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
you can see it did a 450 when you look

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.160 
you can see it did a 450 when you look
back<00:03:31.610> at<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> 44<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.390> had<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> bump<00:03:32.990> a<00:03:33.080> little

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
back at the 44 I had a bump a little

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.460 
back at the 44 I had a bump a little
voltage<00:03:33.410> on<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:33.830> for<00:03:34.280> four<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.850> does<00:03:35.090> for<00:03:35.330> 64<00:03:36.020> 66

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
voltage on it for four it does for 64 66

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.850 
voltage on it for four it does for 64 66
and<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.010> for<00:03:37.250> 72<00:03:37.760> when<00:03:38.600> you're<00:03:38.780> at<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.140> 5.0

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
and then for 72 when you're at the 5.0

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.670 
and then for 72 when you're at the 5.0
okay<00:03:40.460> again<00:03:41.270> obviously<00:03:41.690> cranking<00:03:42.560> up<00:03:42.650> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
okay again obviously cranking up the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.770 
okay again obviously cranking up the
volts<00:03:43.100> where<00:03:43.280> they<00:03:43.400> shouldn't<00:03:43.640> be<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.660> to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
volts where they shouldn't be just to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.330 
volts where they shouldn't be just to
keep<00:03:44.960> it<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.440> where<00:03:45.530> it's<00:03:45.650> tables<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.190> run

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
keep it to where it's tables to run

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.460 
keep it to where it's tables to run
tests<00:03:46.820> no<00:03:47.360> blue<00:03:47.570> screens<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:48.050> kind<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.260> stuff

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
tests no blue screens that kind of stuff

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.380 
tests no blue screens that kind of stuff
so<00:03:48.500> but<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.460> you<00:03:49.550> come<00:03:49.670> over<00:03:49.730> here<00:03:49.940> we're<00:03:50.090> 3d

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
so but if you come over here we're 3d

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.500 
so but if you come over here we're 3d
mark<00:03:50.720> for<00:03:51.440> scaling<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:52.370> actually<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.150> scales

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
mark for scaling it actually it scales

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.200 
mark for scaling it actually it scales
better<00:03:53.930> than<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> 8150<00:03:55.010> my<00:03:55.160> opinion<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.760> it

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
better than the 8150 my opinion and it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.030 
better than the 8150 my opinion and it
jumps<00:03:56.540> up<00:03:56.720> when<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:56.990> when<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.530> obviously

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
jumps up when you when you obviously

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.220 
jumps up when you when you obviously
clock<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.610> when<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.180> gets<00:03:59.330> into<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.750> into<00:04:00.140> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
clock it when it gets into the into the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.040 
clock it when it gets into the into the
four<00:04:00.530> range<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.190> slows<00:04:01.880> down<00:04:01.910> at<00:04:02.360> that<00:04:02.510> point<00:04:02.780> I

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
four range it slows down at that point I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.870 
four range it slows down at that point I
don't<00:04:03.770> know<00:04:03.830> what<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.130> score<00:04:04.520> was<00:04:04.670> that

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
don't know what that score was that

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.640 
don't know what that score was that
didn't<00:04:05.030> even<00:04:05.060> score<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.510> high<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:06.050> then<00:04:06.290> it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
didn't even score is high and then it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.910 
didn't even score is high and then it
actually<00:04:07.130> when<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:07.910> was<00:04:08.000> clocked<00:04:08.300> at<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.570> higher

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
actually when it was clocked at a higher

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.280 
actually when it was clocked at a higher
the<00:04:09.920> voltages<00:04:10.400> either<00:04:10.760> word<00:04:11.000> either<00:04:11.720> knocking

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the voltages either word either knocking

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.920 
the voltages either word either knocking
it<00:04:12.410> down<00:04:12.940> disabling<00:04:13.940> quarters<00:04:14.360> at<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.630> point

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
it down disabling quarters at that point

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.200 
it down disabling quarters at that point
it<00:04:15.380> never<00:04:15.560> got<00:04:15.740> over<00:04:15.950> 36<00:04:16.580> Celsius<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:17.270> still

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
it never got over 36 Celsius but still

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.909 
it never got over 36 Celsius but still
obviously<00:04:20.210> it<00:04:20.570> doesn't<00:04:20.780> work<00:04:20.989> too<00:04:21.169> well<00:04:21.320> when

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
obviously it doesn't work too well when

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.040 
obviously it doesn't work too well when
it<00:04:22.669> comes<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.000> video<00:04:23.270> in<00:04:23.419> that<00:04:23.540> point

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
it comes to video in that point

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.140 
it comes to video in that point
but<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:25.009> sort<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.310> understand<00:04:25.879> at<00:04:26.000> this

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
but you can sort of understand at this

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.710 
but you can sort of understand at this
point<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:26.629> very<00:04:26.930> similar<00:04:27.259> to<00:04:28.479> really<00:04:29.479> in<00:04:29.599> my

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
point it's very similar to really in my

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.550 
point it's very similar to really in my
opinion<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.259> six<00:04:30.500> core<00:04:30.680> is<00:04:30.830> like<00:04:31.009> a<00:04:32.020> 965<00:04:33.050> in<00:04:33.409> my

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
opinion the six core is like a 965 in my

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.740 
opinion the six core is like a 965 in my
opinion<00:04:33.949> but<00:04:34.190> obviously<00:04:35.150> if<00:04:35.300> it<00:04:35.419> goes<00:04:35.539> into

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
opinion but obviously if it goes into

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.300 
opinion but obviously if it goes into
the<00:04:35.900> multi-threaded<00:04:36.560> applications<00:04:37.129> it

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
the multi-threaded applications it

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.480 
the multi-threaded applications it
should<00:04:37.639> in<00:04:37.940> theory<00:04:38.919> work<00:04:39.919> better<00:04:40.159> than<00:04:40.430> the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
should in theory work better than the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.180 
should in theory work better than the
965<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.599> at<00:04:41.810> least<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.199> would<00:04:42.349> hope<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:42.949> but

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
965 so at least you would hope so but

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.809 
965 so at least you would hope so but
there<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.490> go

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
there you go

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.850 
there you go
I<00:04:43.849> wanted<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.750> make<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:44.990> quick<00:04:45.229> video<00:04:45.349> on<00:04:45.560> it

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
I wanted to make a quick video on it

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.529 
I wanted to make a quick video on it
didn't<00:04:46.159> want<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.400> drag<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.759> out<00:04:46.819> that<00:04:47.060> much<00:04:47.240> but

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
didn't want to drag it out that much but

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.300 
didn't want to drag it out that much but
if<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.080> have<00:04:48.169> questions<00:04:48.379> obviously<00:04:48.770> pull

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
if you have questions obviously pull

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.909 
if you have questions obviously pull
stem<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:49.789> you<00:04:49.879> want<00:04:50.060> me<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.150> run<00:04:50.360> some

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
stem if you want me to run some

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.529 
stem if you want me to run some
benchmarks<00:04:51.919> or<00:04:52.520> something<00:04:52.909> you<00:04:53.240> know<00:04:53.300> I'll<00:04:53.360> do

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
benchmarks or something you know I'll do

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.379 
benchmarks or something you know I'll do
that<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:53.810> can<00:04:54.220> rerun<00:04:55.220> them<00:04:55.340> or<00:04:55.490> whatever<00:04:55.639> so
