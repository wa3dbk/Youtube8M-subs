people I didn't really want my brace to
be<00:00:54.969> seen<00:00:55.239> but<00:00:55.989> think<00:00:56.229> I<00:00:56.289> feel<00:00:56.500> quite

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
be seen but think I feel quite

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.549 
be seen but think I feel quite
self-conscious<00:00:57.309> with<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.640> brace<00:00:57.820> at<00:00:58.030> my<00:00:58.149> age

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
self-conscious with the brace at my age

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.859 
self-conscious with the brace at my age
so<00:00:59.559> my<00:00:59.979> dentists<00:01:00.519> jested<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.000> make<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.329> lingual

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
so my dentists jested to make a lingual

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.859 
so my dentists jested to make a lingual
brace<00:01:02.369> the<00:01:03.369> actual<00:01:03.640> brand<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.180> my<00:01:04.330> brace<00:01:04.600> is

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
brace the actual brand of my brace is

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.160 
brace the actual brand of my brace is
called<00:01:05.140> an<00:01:05.259> incognito<00:01:05.649> lingual<00:01:06.369> brace<00:01:06.549> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
called an incognito lingual brace and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.889 
called an incognito lingual brace and
the<00:01:08.170> reason<00:01:08.500> he<00:01:08.619> suggested<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.460> because

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
the reason he suggested that is because

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.169 
the reason he suggested that is because
with<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.929> fixed<00:01:11.409> brace<00:01:11.679> as<00:01:12.069> opposed<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:12.970> other

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
with a fixed brace as opposed to other

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.630 
with a fixed brace as opposed to other
options<00:01:13.569> I<00:01:13.960> like<00:01:14.110> Inga's<00:01:14.560> aligned<00:01:14.860> he<00:01:15.399> has

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
options I like Inga's aligned he has

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.779 
options I like Inga's aligned he has
full<00:01:16.119> control<00:01:16.330> over<00:01:16.690> my<00:01:16.929> teeth<00:01:17.459> and<00:01:18.459> he<00:01:18.580> can

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
full control over my teeth and he can

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.520 
full control over my teeth and he can
really<00:01:19.240> make<00:01:19.539> sure<00:01:19.569> that<00:01:19.780> they<00:01:20.020> move<00:01:20.200> exactly

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
really make sure that they move exactly

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.490 
really make sure that they move exactly
how<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.890> want<00:01:21.069> them<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:23.409> an

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
how you want them to and with an

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.609 
how you want them to and with an
incognito<00:01:23.770> on<00:01:24.659> he's<00:01:25.659> actually<00:01:25.869> placed<00:01:26.319> on<00:01:26.500> the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
incognito on he's actually placed on the

incognito on he's actually placed on the
inside<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.250> teeth<00:01:27.929> down<00:01:28.929> there<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:30.039> nobody

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
inside of the teeth down there so nobody

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.249 
inside of the teeth down there so nobody
nobody<00:01:31.090> knows<00:01:31.209> having<00:01:31.509> treatment<00:01:31.720> unless<00:01:32.080> you

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
nobody knows having treatment unless you

that's<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:18.030> main<00:03:18.270> problem<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.080> why<00:03:19.290> think

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
that's the main problem and why think

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
what makes them look a bit bigger is

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.370 
what makes them look a bit bigger is
that<00:03:21.150> I've<00:03:21.240> got<00:03:21.270> what's<00:03:21.600> called<00:03:21.810> quite<00:03:22.140> now

that I've got what's called quite now
smile<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.730> focus<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.390> all<00:03:24.540> on<00:03:24.570> these<00:03:24.870> two

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
smile so the focus is all on these two

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.600 
smile so the focus is all on these two
teeth<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> front<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:26.100> these<00:03:26.280> teeth<00:03:26.580> here

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
teeth in the front all these teeth here

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.670 
teeth in the front all these teeth here
it's<00:03:27.360> not<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.600> seen<00:03:27.840> awful<00:03:28.140> lot<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.290> them

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
so when I smile all the focus goes on

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.470 
so when I smile all the focus goes on
those<00:03:31.530> tt-that<00:03:32.070> different<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:36.060> cross

have<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.210> brace<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.690> we're<00:03:43.140> gonna<00:03:43.260> fix<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.710> as

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
have a brace on we're gonna fix that as

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.650 
have a brace on we're gonna fix that as
well<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.550> I'll<00:03:44.640> show<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:50.270> where<00:03:51.270> the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
well so I'll show you that where the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.690 
well so I'll show you that where the
teeth<00:03:51.900> here<00:03:52.170> sort<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.500> fold<00:03:52.800> inward<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.670> that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
teeth here sort of fold inward so that

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.030 
teeth here sort of fold inward so that
they<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:54.690> meet<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.020> top<00:03:55.350> teeth<00:03:55.590> properly

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
they don't meet the top teeth properly

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.260 
they don't meet the top teeth properly
and<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.190> can't<00:03:56.400> really<00:03:56.489> bite<00:03:56.730> together<00:03:56.880> on<00:03:57.120> that

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
and I can't really bite together on that

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.720 
and I can't really bite together on that
side<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:58.470> one<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> problem<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.580> my

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
side and it's one of the problem with my

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.760 
side and it's one of the problem with my
teeth<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.300> I've<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:01.020> quite<00:04:01.230> big<00:04:01.440> over

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
teeth is that I've got quite big over

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.340 
teeth is that I've got quite big over
bites<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.250> these<00:04:02.520> teeth<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:03.020> overlap<00:04:04.020> quite

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
bites and these teeth here overlap quite

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.500 
bites and these teeth here overlap quite
significantly<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.220> my<00:04:05.370> bottom<00:04:05.730> set<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.390> if<00:04:06.450> I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
significantly as my bottom set so if I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.670 
significantly as my bottom set so if I
turn<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.870> side<00:04:07.050> you'll<00:04:07.260> be<00:04:07.290> able<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.560> see

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
turn to the side you'll be able to see

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.520 
turn to the side you'll be able to see
that

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.160 

okay<00:04:15.490> director<00:04:16.180> while<00:04:16.359> all<00:04:16.480> those<00:04:16.600> problems

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
okay director while all those problems

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.620 
okay director while all those problems
the<00:04:17.380> orthodontist<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.190> going<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.670> restart<00:04:19.480> is

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
the orthodontist is going to restart is

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.300 
the orthodontist is going to restart is
going<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.870> actually<00:04:20.140> grind<00:04:20.380> down<00:04:20.739> my<00:04:21.250> two

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
going to actually grind down my two

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.430 
going to actually grind down my two
biggest<00:04:21.760> teeth<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:22.990> will<00:04:23.080> get<00:04:23.230> rid<00:04:23.380> of

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
biggest teeth so that will get rid of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.780 
biggest teeth so that will get rid of
those<00:04:23.500> ridges<00:04:23.860> off<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.100> bottom<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.520> you'll

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
those ridges off the bottom and you'll

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.270 
those ridges off the bottom and you'll
grind<00:04:25.240> them<00:04:25.420> down<00:04:25.570> at<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.780> sides<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.350> well<00:04:26.380> so

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
grind them down at the sides as well so

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.890 
grind them down at the sides as well so
they<00:04:27.430> actually<00:04:27.730> will<00:04:27.850> physically<00:04:28.240> be<00:04:28.510> smaller

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
they actually will physically be smaller

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.540 
they actually will physically be smaller
but<00:04:29.350> obviously<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.890> can't<00:04:29.950> grind<00:04:30.400> them<00:04:30.520> down

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
but obviously I can't grind them down

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.220 
but obviously I can't grind them down
too<00:04:30.970> much<00:04:31.180> because<00:04:31.450> if<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.780> goes<00:04:31.840> down<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.170> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
too much because if it goes down to the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.660 
too much because if it goes down to the
dentin<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.860> he<00:04:32.980> would<00:04:33.130> be<00:04:33.190> really<00:04:33.400> unhealthy

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
dentin this he would be really unhealthy

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.200 
dentin this he would be really unhealthy
but<00:04:34.180> all<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:35.500> he's<00:04:36.490> also<00:04:36.670> going<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.000> push

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
but all that so he's also going to push

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.700 
but all that so he's also going to push
them<00:04:37.360> upwards<00:04:37.840> which<00:04:38.230> I<00:04:38.320> think<00:04:38.440> it's<00:04:38.560> quite

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
them upwards which I think it's quite

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.470 
them upwards which I think it's quite
common<00:04:38.980> thing<00:04:39.250> but<00:04:39.400> my<00:04:39.670> sister<00:04:40.000> had<00:04:40.150> quite

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
common thing but my sister had quite

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.940 
common thing but my sister had quite
similar<00:04:40.840> teeth<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.200> me<00:04:41.290> like<00:04:41.470> two<00:04:41.710> bigger

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
similar teeth to me like two bigger

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.190 
similar teeth to me like two bigger
teeth<00:04:42.220> in<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.970> middle<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.480> hers<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:43.930> pushed

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
teeth in the middle so hers but pushed

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.540 
teeth in the middle so hers but pushed
up<00:04:44.350> as<00:04:44.470> well<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.770> that's<00:04:44.830> what<00:04:44.980> I'll<00:04:45.100> do<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.400> my

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
up as well and that's what I'll do to my

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.730 
up as well and that's what I'll do to my
nose<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.030> push<00:04:46.300> them<00:04:46.480> up<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.200> that<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.500> level

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
nose and push them up so that the level

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.570 
nose and push them up so that the level
of<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.010> teeth<00:04:48.340> here<00:04:48.669> will<00:04:49.150> be<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.720> same<00:04:50.580> and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
of the teeth here will be the same and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.570 
of the teeth here will be the same and
he'll<00:04:51.730> also<00:04:51.970> widen<00:04:52.600> my<00:04:52.630> smile<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.320> these<00:04:54.280> teeth

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
he'll also widen my smile so these teeth

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.070 
he'll also widen my smile so these teeth
at<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.760> front<00:04:54.850> will<00:04:55.210> get<00:04:55.300> pushed<00:04:55.540> backwards

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
at the front will get pushed backwards

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.409 
at the front will get pushed backwards
all<00:04:56.650> these<00:04:56.980> teeth<00:04:57.250> here<00:04:57.280> will<00:04:57.640> come<00:04:57.850> round<00:04:58.150> at

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
all these teeth here will come round at

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.960 
all these teeth here will come round at
the<00:04:58.450> sides<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.590> create<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.890> wider<00:05:00.190> smile<00:05:00.669> so

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
the sides to create a wider smile so

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.659 
the sides to create a wider smile so
that<00:05:01.000> they<00:05:01.270> seem<00:05:01.630> smaller<00:05:02.280> they're<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.400> quiet

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
that they seem smaller they're not quiet

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.810 
that they seem smaller they're not quiet
they<00:05:03.970> don't<00:05:04.150> draw<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.360> eye<00:05:04.510> quite<00:05:04.930> as<00:05:05.050> much

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
they don't draw the eye quite as much

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.460 
they don't draw the eye quite as much
and<00:05:06.820> those<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.660> cross<00:05:07.900> bite<00:05:08.110> will<00:05:08.230> just<00:05:08.380> be

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
and those that cross bite will just be

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.120 
and those that cross bite will just be
pushed<00:05:08.710> outwards

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
pushed outwards

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.460 
pushed outwards
an<00:05:11.670> incognito<00:05:12.090> lingual<00:05:12.690> brace<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.110> really

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
an incognito lingual brace is a really

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.050 
an incognito lingual brace is a really
expensive<00:05:13.740> option<00:05:14.400> I've<00:05:14.490> got<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.730> be<00:05:14.820> honest

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
expensive option I've got to be honest

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.740 
expensive option I've got to be honest
it's<00:05:15.330> made<00:05:15.510> about<00:05:15.750> 18<00:05:15.990> karat<00:05:16.320> gold<00:05:16.460> it's

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
it's made about 18 karat gold it's

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.260 
it's made about 18 karat gold it's
custom<00:05:18.750> made<00:05:18.960> in<00:05:19.550> Germany<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.940> reason

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
custom made in Germany and the reason

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.580 
custom made in Germany and the reason
it's<00:05:21.360> custom<00:05:21.750> made<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.080> because<00:05:22.200> it's<00:05:22.440> being

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
it's custom made is because it's being

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.650 
it's custom made is because it's being
fixed<00:05:22.920> on<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.070> inside<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.490> my<00:05:23.700> teeth<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.630> I

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
fixed on the inside of my teeth so I

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.270 
fixed on the inside of my teeth so I
can't<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.380> know<00:05:25.500> if<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.800> have<00:05:25.920> one<00:05:26.070> on<00:05:26.190> the
