00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.590
 The people here are the cabin of you. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.500

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.260

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.519
 the arm 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.519
 left here 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:53.620
 since the painting area of ​​the cabin 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:57.970
 with much improvised roles such 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.970
 help to get an idea how it was 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.190
 I'm connected because of this noise 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.290
 on the mixer 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 messy 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.870
 in the painting area this morning did not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.870
 Remember the fucking measure 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.720
 and the drying area is on that door 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.720
 on here 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:42.880
 also missing some details 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.700
 such a highlight of wardrobe and purchase 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.979
 in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 any house that works with products 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.799
 for 9 and just as wood is seen in this 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.330
 here is why it saw not applied beautiful ne 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.880

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.570
 I want to use my god, it 's one thing 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 bad to pass 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.560
 I'll put more of these here yet. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.269
 lack much Adriano thing over but 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.519
 more for you to have an idea here 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.120
 I'll also put one of the lamps 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.970
 yellow to see if I can do it here 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.970
 an area closer to a greenhouse 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.620
 foto bbc only holds up to 45 degrees 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.010
 so I can not put a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 250 degree drying also did not measure 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.540
 temperature to see how it rolls 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.620
 That's it 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.620
