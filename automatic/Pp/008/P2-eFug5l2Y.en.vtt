00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.759 
all a dream but then she noticed there
was<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.450> rainbow-colored<00:02:39.230> leaf<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.650> her

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
was a rainbow-colored leaf on her

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.390 
was a rainbow-colored leaf on her
pumpkin<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.549> realized<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> wasn't<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
pumpkin and realized that it wasn't the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.910 
pumpkin and realized that it wasn't the
end<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.310> very<00:02:46.390> simple<00:02:47.390> kids<00:02:48.380> story

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
end so it's a very simple kids story

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.490 
end so it's a very simple kids story
kind<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.700> like<00:02:49.850> Cinderella<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.600> suppose<00:02:51.019> but

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
kind of like Cinderella I suppose but

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.229 
kind of like Cinderella I suppose but
the<00:02:51.739> pictures<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.070> really<00:02:52.340> cute<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.940> that's

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
the pictures are really cute and that's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.330 
the pictures are really cute and that's
cool<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.510> they<00:02:53.989> put<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.890> with<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.070> toy

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
cool that they put this in with a toy

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.170 
cool that they put this in with a toy
because<00:02:56.950> since<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> kid's<00:02:58.549> toy<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.970> will

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
because since it is a kid's toy it will

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.150 
because since it is a kid's toy it will
give<00:02:59.360> kids<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.900> chance<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.500> practice<00:03:00.920> reading

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
give kids a chance to practice reading

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.620 
give kids a chance to practice reading
and<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.739> brings<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.489> video<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.030> an<00:03:05.360> end

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
and so that brings this video to an end

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.410 
and so that brings this video to an end
but<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.170> hope<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.530> liked<00:03:06.769> this<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.790> video<00:03:07.970> I
