different depending on the mat like yeah
that's<00:01:36.050> blue<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.770> just<00:01:37.520> when<00:01:37.730> kriebel<00:01:38.000> met

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
that's blue and just when kriebel met

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.510 
that's blue and just when kriebel met
this<00:01:38.480> was<00:01:38.750> actually<00:01:38.930> green<00:01:39.440> but<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.340> turned

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
this was actually green but it turned

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.200 
this was actually green but it turned
out<00:01:40.610> black<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.550> brown<00:01:43.850> was

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
out black and then the brown was

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.800 
out black and then the brown was
actually<00:01:44.630> gold<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:46.940> was<00:01:47.090> silver<00:01:47.450> um

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
actually gold and that was silver um

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.450 
actually gold and that was silver um
so<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.020> prices<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.220> mats<00:01:53.799> would<00:01:54.799> be<00:01:54.920> 25<00:01:55.340> to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
so the prices of the mats would be 25 to

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.990 
so the prices of the mats would be 25 to
50<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.090> would<00:01:56.210> include<00:01:56.240> shipping<00:01:58.000> costs

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
50 and that would include shipping costs

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.899 
50 and that would include shipping costs
and<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.570> mat<00:01:59.810> itself<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.689> if<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.340> sent<00:02:04.670> me<00:02:04.880> a

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
and the mat itself so if you sent me a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.410 
and the mat itself so if you sent me a
blank<00:02:05.390> met<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.110> wanted<00:02:06.380> me<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.500> draw<00:02:06.799> on

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
blank met that you wanted me to draw on

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.540 
blank met that you wanted me to draw on
I<00:02:08.420> could<00:02:08.989> do<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.979> could<00:02:10.160> bump<00:02:10.429> down

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
I could do that and I could bump down

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.270 
I could do that and I could bump down
the<00:02:10.700> price<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:12.500> can<00:02:12.650> negotiate<00:02:12.830> that
