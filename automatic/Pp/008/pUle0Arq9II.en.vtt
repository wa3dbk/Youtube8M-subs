okay so starting off with taking off the
spring<00:00:03.210> cover<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.870> Mac<00:00:04.799> PC<00:00:05.040> or<00:00:05.700> Mac<00:00:06.060> laptop

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
spring cover of the Mac PC or Mac laptop

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.089 
spring cover of the Mac PC or Mac laptop
you<00:00:07.589> got<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.799> take<00:00:07.980> well<00:00:08.910> if<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.330> look<00:00:10.099> there's

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
you got to take well if you look there's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.140 
you got to take well if you look there's
each<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.580> these<00:00:11.730> little<00:00:13.280> notches<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:15.030> hook

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
each of these little notches that hook

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.870 
each of these little notches that hook
it<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.139> laptop<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.760> you're

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it on to the laptop so what you're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.640 
it on to the laptop so what you're
supposed<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.289> top<00:00:19.470> one

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
supposed to do is we take the top one

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.730 
supposed to do is we take the top one
off<00:00:20.000> then<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.210> take<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.590> back

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
off then you take the one on the back

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.919 
off then you take the one on the back
those<00:00:23.430> two<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.880> apply<00:00:29.880> pressure

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
those two off so you just apply pressure

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.910 
those two off so you just apply pressure
kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:34.670> take<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.410> then<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
kind of take that then you just get it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.090 
kind of take that then you just get it
partially<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:39.710> don't<00:00:40.710> apply<00:00:40.890> too<00:00:40.950> much

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
partially off don't apply too much

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.490 
partially off don't apply too much
pressure<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> could<00:00:42.030> break<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.500> then

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pressure because you could break it then

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.040 
pressure because you could break it then
the<00:00:43.680> next<00:00:43.920> step<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.989> take<00:00:45.989> any<00:00:46.440> old<00:00:46.710> card<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
the next step is take any old card and

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.869 
the next step is take any old card and
then<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.770> put<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.870> slot<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.760> then<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
then you put it in the slot and then you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
then you put it in the slot and then you
slide<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> back<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> slide<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
slide it back and you slide it all the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.610 
slide it back and you slide it all the
way<00:00:58.489> until<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.789> gets<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.379> notch

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
way until it gets to about that notch

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.700 
way until it gets to about that notch
you<00:01:04.400> take<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> second<00:01:05.820> card<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:07.260> push<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you take a second card you push the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
you take a second card you push the
screen<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> screen

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
screen out a little bit or the screen

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.890 
screen out a little bit or the screen
cover<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.330> then<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.689> put

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
cover out a little bit and then you put

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.149 
cover out a little bit and then you put
another<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.420 

sometimes<00:01:22.909> kind<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.270> pain<00:01:23.540> in<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.689> butt<00:01:23.869> and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
sometimes kind of pain in the butt and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.670 
sometimes kind of pain in the butt and
you<00:01:25.430> get<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:25.970> there<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:27.170> take<00:01:27.380> both<00:01:27.619> of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
you get that in there we take both of

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.460 
you get that in there we take both of
them<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.960> slide<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.409> down<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:32.470> then

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
them you slide it down and then

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.960 
them you slide it down and then
sometimes<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.009> will<00:01:34.100> just<00:01:34.220> snap<00:01:34.490> off<00:01:34.700> like

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
sometimes it will just snap off like

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.420 
sometimes it will just snap off like
that<00:01:35.119> did<00:01:35.360> other<00:01:36.290> times<00:01:36.590> you'll<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:37.189> get<00:01:37.310> it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
that did other times you'll just get it

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.580 
that did other times you'll just get it
down<00:01:37.549> then<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.060> have<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.330> try<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.229> pry<00:01:39.530> it

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
down then you just have to try to pry it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.060 
down then you just have to try to pry it
outwards<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.869> then<00:01:41.869> at<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:42.170> point<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.680> just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
outwards and then at this point you just

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.420 
outwards and then at this point you just
keep<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.399> doing<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.729> process<00:01:45.190> until<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.310> get

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
keep on doing the process until you get

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:58.920 
keep on doing the process until you get
all<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.759> way<00:01:47.060> around<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.390> computer

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.680 

then<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.050> get<00:02:00.260> on<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.560> other<00:02:00.680> side<00:02:00.890> too<00:02:01.190> but

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
then you get on the other side too but

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.830 
then you get on the other side too but
usually<00:02:02.690> after<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.020> get<00:02:03.140> these<00:02:03.940> you<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.240> for

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
usually after you get these you just for

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:28.130 
usually after you get these you just for
the<00:02:05.900> most<00:02:06.110> purchase<00:02:06.470> pull<00:02:06.680> right<00:02:06.890> off

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.290 

and<00:02:29.140> then<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.950> off<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.090> how<00:02:31.240> you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
and then it's off and that's how you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.380 
and then it's off and that's how you
take<00:02:31.450> off<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.590> screen<00:02:33.190> cover<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:34.060> Mac

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
take off the screen cover of a Mac

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.540
