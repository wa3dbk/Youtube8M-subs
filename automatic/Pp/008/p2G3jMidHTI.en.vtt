00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 well I review this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 monokey and extensible we take 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.200
 let us prolong we see that it can become 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:18.859
 very long even go up to a meter 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:21.240
 almost and what all the world is then 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.590
 exceedingly we prayed seen in other cases 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.220
 this time there is a small accessory 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 that really very nice very useful 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 let's pull the tab see here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 tongues dinner in the morning the tongue 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's see how I did it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.920
 ok we will see it so this gets longer 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.629
 very ok it's under there is a video from a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 fourth and we can attack it as well as 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.710
 up here any other tripod then 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.570
 even on a normal easel we can 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 take and use our phone 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.309
 on the easel the other things you need 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.899
 to stabilize oneself because beyond 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.969
 phone resumes with a camera then 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.980
 the camera a need to 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.699
 stabilization to be managed in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.680
 better way 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.680
 so he can learn to keep phone 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.600
 maybe not even beyond that we can 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.610
 use things for this 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 settling from and sensitive here are there 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.659
 of the elections that is loosening this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.240
 let's loosen or not this game then 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.000
 we tighten the clutch 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 well we put this up here and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.610
 let's turn this wheel ok finally 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.560
 inside phone arrived to the alleged 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 let's see what the phone is 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 closed fairly stable ha 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.640
 said let's say except things for sports though 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.369
 let's say shine normal walking is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 excellent gives us the opportunity to stretch 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.649
 the phone then away from the hand 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.780
 so this is already a great thing 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.329
 we can also give the phone a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.250
 treatment of the recovery instead 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.869
 to take the phone so where everyone 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.570
 they make a usual mistake they reject this 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.850
 button the volume buttons that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.409
 they create the zoom while keeping the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.939
 phone remains easier 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.310
 the phone is more stable because a 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.680
 account is to manage the phone 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.079
 so that one can learn but it is difficult 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.899
 an account a firm grip in this 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.300
 way is much safer and more natural and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.360
 therefore to this possibility without 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.150
 consider that you can do a type of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.489
 trolley type from bottom to top 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.280
 from right to left than with a 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.930
 simple movement of the wrist to move 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.750
 the camera and a lot more way 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 natural so definitely seen also 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.239
 the paltry price of these accessories 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.420
 approved and serve to transform a 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.030
 normal cell phone in a camera that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.220
 it is managed much better so now me 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.220
 I will put more or less what they are called a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.510
 telescopic monopod and cell phone holder 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.510
 I will not even put in the description 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.240
 Italy Italy Italy 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270
 of course 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.270
 to
