00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.830
 Handy box and that is the box music 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 one from technaxx or whatever 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 This manufacturer is called 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.000
 and yes I would say I catch the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.710
 Just unpack it 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.850
 yes okay so definitely on the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 page to click on one side 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.910
 all of you can be so peter of both 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.179
 pages on whether it is relevant now 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
 is no idea 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.809
 So we have the box in silver here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 and down here we have fruit 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.579
 Wrong around the manual on 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.239
 German English French Spanish 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.350
 and Italian 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 yes here in front of it again 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.640
 little description and down there 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.129
 same and facebook climb that again 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.760
 wrong around and in this quasi 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:03.989
 manual is located once 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 such a manual me 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.700
 Not much is up here now 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.920
 okay okay you can do that 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.680
 yes, we in it is important in there 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 how are you at safety instructions 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.070
 probably and so if that creates 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.590
 read 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:28.080
 then we have an aux here in here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 Cable to connect with any 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.210
 player and a power cable 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.840
 the side input for in the box and on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.220
 the side of a usb stick so a usb 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 Connection USB stick exactly in any case 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 can be about the box charge what 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.140
 other not if you do not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.509
 like a tablet playstation laptop 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 you also want to recharge then you can 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.250
 buy an adapter in the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 outlet goes or you have at home 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.270
 another dc 5 volt power supply rumfliegen 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.920
 like me here for example and on 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 the other side exactly this connection 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.239
 then you can use the car you should 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.830
 but be careful that there is output dc 5 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.240
 volt has 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.160
 yes then we just come to the box 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.160
 it looks really pretty chic 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.820
 and very well made of brushed 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.270
 aluminum 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.040
 they are available in pink green silver black 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.900
 and blue 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.590
 where black is the current price 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.810
 Amazon 19 90 and all other colors 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.860
 cost just 25 euro 24 something I 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 will definitely the video again 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.380
 Write description 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.990
 and yes we have a speaker 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.110
 and because a speaker so stereo 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.440
 with a protective net also made of aluminum 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.390
 I think so feels like 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 In any case, the very well processed 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.310
 What kind of price can you really get there 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.820
 say nothing 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.360
 and up here we have a usb 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.670
 connection 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.950
 here we have a micro sd card 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.930
 slot here is the power switch then 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.170
 Here we have the laughter in for that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.730
 cable here is the charging port and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.700
 here the antenna connection sees so 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.690
 everything alike 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.220
 well you should not necessarily one now 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.810
 aux connection with the dc 5 volt 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.400
 connection confused and could be his 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.090
 central of this little piece 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.530
 you do not want to break off that 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.870
 so it can give it back radio 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.459
 per micro sd play is no perks 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.000
 play or it can be up here 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.170
 play usb radio goes only if one 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 here an antenna is inserted 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.440
 or you can the cable there 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 put it in the wrong way with packaging 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.230
 threw 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.970
 or you can just here the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.830
 but plugged in because 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.650
 it made of metal effects then also ukw 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.300
 choose when you will make now 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.800
 it immediately out automatically on radio 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.290
 umspringt if nothing is plugged 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.200
 we have a blue led down here 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.500
 the box is the same for all colors 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.820
 again off when the box is off 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.980
 you see, you will also see this led 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.160
 red if you had hired her if 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.690
 while she is on then this will 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.610
 Led violet so I'll be right back 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.200
 just make a separate video where 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.100
 I just turn the box on and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.060
 yes the sound you play what you 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.200
 probably over the microphone anyway 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.169
 not so good but the sound is 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.460
 really really good so here I am 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.410
 back and I have now 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.480
 I mean 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.540
 brought together usb stick where 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.190
 loud music sad and have me 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.650
 just the best song 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.730
 picked out what a little something has whether 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.950
 you like it and do not like it anymore 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.190
 even so I do not care 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.190
 to blame 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.430
 By the way, I forgot about that 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.710
 say if you're here plus so here 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.440
 go's song to the right here goes left 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.850
 got left then here valium plus 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.950
 wool - then here break or play and 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.900
 over here we can between usb sd 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.900
 and switch radio 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.010
 Yes, I'll just start 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:28.040
 quickly back out at no 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:31.490
 to get the gema problems so I know 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.290
 not how much you hear in the video now 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.290
 In any case, the sound is really good 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.360
 and also really good bucks here 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.880
 the back comes out of the good air 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.470
 Connect so the bass is not 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.680
 bad and generally the sound quality 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.419
 is not bad i already have one 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.860
 few times that the box oversteers 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.020
 if you have to maximum volume 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.030
 gone where is I suspect it 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.110
 the quality of the audio files is and 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.520
 not on the box itself 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.410
 You can also get up very often 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.630
 hear the highest volume without that 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:10.990
 Something overrides everyone 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.400
 case that was an unboxing and review by 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.840
 this box here and I hope it has 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.740
 pay you 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.130
 Just leave an abo there and yes that 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.130
 it was already
