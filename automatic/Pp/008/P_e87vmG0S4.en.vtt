00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.810
 talk about being Saturday of a lot of rain here 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.430
 in the kartódromo of the great beach since 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.990
 We're going to roll the track. Let's do it. 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.449
 a thermal plant efficiency test 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.980
 metal horse here in the team's pits 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.380
 kart reiter 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.829
 for this test we will use a kart 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.960
 of the category f400 sport and sicart 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.859
 uses a motor home is 400 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 engine that develops 22 hp to 7200 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.400
 rpm 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.110
 first we measure the temperature of the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.060
 collector to reach peaks of 316 degrees 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.830
 Now tell me the end of the pipe. 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.830
 reach 200 degree peaks 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.670
 and finally we measured the temperature of 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.410
 Exhaust exhaust at 120 degrees 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 all within the rotation limit 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.809
 established now let's apply the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 original metal horse technique 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.250
 the tape technically at the moment if it is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.379
 made from basalt fiber the ribbons 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.640
 of basalt fiber need not be 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.640
 wet for installation 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.899
 to finish, just cut the end of the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.500
 tape and fasten with the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.649
 names now let's re-measure the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 The temperature of heat applied 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.300
 collector video around 100 degrees one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.850
 reduction of 68% 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.560
 the end of the net pipe around 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 Reduction of 62% and finally 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 temperature of the gas leaving the exhaust or 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.600
 we shared a gain of 78% in the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 exhaust temperature and pressure 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.440
 for the short escape as of kart 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 the guys and 6-hour efficiency 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.799
 applied in kart 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.050
 you saw how it reduced the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.789
 canon collector temperature and 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.800
 increased the temperature of the gas outlet 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.569
 leakage enhancing the flow 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.539
 another important point for use 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.879
 in the kart is to facilitate the calculation 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.319
 because the go-kart is caught behind and 

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:04.140
 many times the pilot ends up burning 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.879
 overalls in the exhaust pipe paraná during 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.899
 the verification will look for your position 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.149
 during a race 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.280
 Good, I'm going to stay here and talk to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.110
 People are just sending mail to rome 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.620
 metal org.br 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 thanks
