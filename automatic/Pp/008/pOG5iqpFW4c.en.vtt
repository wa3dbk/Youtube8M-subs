00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello my girls welcome today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.420

 please and I invite you to see the tutorial 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's start by passing us a base of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.740
 shadow on our entire eyelid this is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.740
 a whole skin and from the cake brand 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 now I'm going to apply throughout my basin 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.540
 a shade of brown roses already shadow 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.230
 mate and let's put with a brush 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.230
 chubby girl 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.130
 let's now take our palette of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.380
 costales sense the smoky and let's 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.750
 choose this dark color we 're going to 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.620
 put on the outer edge as in the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.620
 internal too 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.699
 now we only have to blur and for that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.370
 you can change your brush for one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.320
 more chubby and circular mind let's go 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.619
 blurring and degrading very well the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.619
 colour 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.899

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.789

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.670
 super cute and we will apply it in 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.710
 our mobile eyelid and then if you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.079

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.240

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.439
 it has some golden flashes so 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.439

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.620

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.620

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.640
 We will also apply false eyelashes and 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.860

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.320

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.069
 eyelashes with mask 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.829
 in my face I wear a bikini that 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.950
 you know that it does not cover 100% but 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.989
 I use it daily and then now girls 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.290
 and also to blush my cheeks with 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.859
