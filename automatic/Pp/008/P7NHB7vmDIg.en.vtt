00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.710
 tutorial with this little palette in 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
 does it's more than a palette it's a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.609
 set of which contains a little everything 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 we need if we go on a weekend 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.300
 so we can only learn that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.699
 some extra products for example for 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.380
 a little for comfort principle with that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.360
 speed and we all in home 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.020
 urban decay yet indicated if they 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 mark they like 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.510
 particularly 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 many of you have asked me to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
 do a tutorial with it's product 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 found in this palette has 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.500
 so see it if you've watched and at 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.070
 the end I give you my opinion on this 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 together 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.010
 velvet will show you what's in it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 this set up to chic number one for 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 you and furnished so know tourist and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.070
 several headlights whose shapes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 darker there are some that are 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 my so they 'll be bria we have a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 force which we served as playoffs 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 for us a bluff in roundness and in the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 portion of the lot had three chances in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 the first run saw the bear in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.390
 ranges which one has a pencil which in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 the 24 7 with my life enso and finally 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 we have a guy required the rejection for 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.890
 the moment jeannie that apply a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 Korean fountain by eyebrow gillet and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.360
 that's all because all the rest 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.869
 found in this box in fact this 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 together 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 I wanted to start by fetching 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 the bronze in skiing right here the report in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.320
 spin but I gave the tempo to his 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.180
 legs 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.729
 so this is the kid mali except that if 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.920
 you have a tax that more rosy 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.180
 that's what the jury a little bit 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.180
 to accept that the ideal 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.790
 this time we will not make the hole 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.160
 for the person I use she lives it 113 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.160
 Shale journalists 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.690
 I will then hold but the bluff so 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.690
 it's a good laugh 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.170
 and still quite pigmented so 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.070
 finally the attention for 80 m and go I 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.200
 close your eyes 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.060
 I have already applied a base I have a thousand 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 motion jobs to bathe me in the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.910
 original version 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.820
 so I come to get a brush at 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 rounded tip this one is the 305 of 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.100
 pineapple chips and come get the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.840
 first lighthouse of the page including this one 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.500
 is the only man of eyl 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.920
 so it's a kind of copper and rosé 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.930
 with pépets inside and I 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.020
 I'll put that on the eyelid 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020
 mobile 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.510
 for the outer corner portion I'm going 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.540
 take me back 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.739
 the strong so this one is the only man 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 the east breeze 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.629
 it's super good it's a kind of tones 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.180
 darker with a tone more brown than 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.060
 grease 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.579
 then unspoken colors are 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.299
 juxtaposed I press we removed tap 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.620
 with the second of a jump as are 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.930
 a little bit said emma who will come 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.669
 except in hen and then that I'll 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.549
 search a country are dome-shaped 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.189
 where this one 224 from mac and I'm going 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.829
 take first that the lighthouse the most 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.939
 clear here that is a format is this 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.380
 the fixed man and I did not trace the vintage 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:47.990
 like this 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.200
 I take a pretty dense brush and the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.230
 do it right here that's called 50 50 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.020
 fifty fifty and I'm going to redo the arcade 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.310
 brow 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.230
 I will select the small facelift 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.750
 we speak and I will take back the faro 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.250
 resist that so far and I 'm going 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.760
 the employee to come to their of 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.760
 lower lashes 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.010
 we have lost intensity at different levels 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.060
 so I did not take back the lighthouse factory 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.520
 is on the other hand a bit at the outer corner 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.630
 he does go back to do it with eyes that I 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.630
 go back on the eyelid 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.590
 I'm going to take the pencil that comes in 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.080
 the planet their claims to standards this 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.900
 tag is a super good enough rich strand 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.730
 who is not too hot tracy engineer 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.670
 Euro higher than that it will come 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.750
 to act as a high liner is a scholar 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.640
 data even threw a little more 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.260
 definition to the league mission brel 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.390
 working line will otherwise than is 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.120
 will quote vaille and children have had to 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.770
 to have dreaded done more ibuki I know 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.190
 not yet why I 'm going to opt in 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.190
 to follow 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.680
 we finish the material eyes with the 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.970
 master is provided in small 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.500
 boxes so this is the project I have 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.169
 never tested so it'll be a 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.620
 first in China with a touch 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.720
 of gloss of this talent is so sealed to 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.750
 the wood in the liquid range 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.850
 I really like the packaging is like 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.220
 a grain of the pavement really cool 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.139
 for your products 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:37.000
 it's a small detail even then a 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.190
 color that is enough going on everywhere 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.620
 it is natural that is to the naked but 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.389
 that they give so it's actually in 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.460
 I my case it was my color lips 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.020
 but a little darker that 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.919
 looks a little bit more 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.710
 dressed 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.440
 that's a suggestion of water that you 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.970
 can do with the naked and run of 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.780
 Others claimed in 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.539
 I must admit that is a big fan 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.650
 to produce indicated I'm still 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:07.419
 a little disappointed by this palette the 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.789
 level of effort because the pace car 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.530
 is very good the pencil also the cut 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.020
 worry and the small and close soon the 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.599
 found in all blocks 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.780
 fleischer bundy which managed not specified 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.970
 but that's the color so let's stop 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.010
 sss high but in terms of pigmentation 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.070
 women hang much less at 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.780
 the eyelid that usually and they have 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.030
 less time despite a base 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.139
 applied below so that gives me 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.580
 lots that go a lot more 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.260
 natural that are going to be a little less 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.150
 long hold what can hurt us 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.250
 negative fronts just looking 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.030
 a pigmented look and I - town 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.880
 intense 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.520
 as for the bronze in roubaix 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.949
 change 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.169
 at the beginning of the video I was worried about his 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.410
 legs in my body it's not so 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.000
 wrong 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.440
 except that she knew she was affected and pink 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.810
 only before you agree not 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.370
 all I love the blush I 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.080
 door very often I find it to be 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.419
 good goes everywhere he is pink loved 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.659
 is not too baby while his mac os 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.159
 marrow and the lighthouse as well 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.479
 time the illuminator I find 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:08.030
 because there are no big spas there 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.229
 is inside where does it come from? 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.150
 I think it's still a good 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.979
 buy because honestly all of us 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.180
 in this palette the water except the 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:19.069
 healthy products and unless a ball 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.759
 always a crime I find the idea is 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.009
 really good 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.680
 to have everything in there then the products 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.810
 In short, the naked theme challenges me 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.909
 a lot so it'll be first a 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.840
 projectile to the tone of your skin 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:31.759
 and where that's what you're looking for 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.740
 wait for pigmentation for your headlights 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.150
 on this month I wish a happy birthday 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.469
 day I invite you to subscribe to 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.130
 my channel then we will know in a 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:39.130
 next video
