VW Rabbit or golf depending on where
you're<00:00:24.500> from

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770

engineering<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:27.140> don't<00:00:27.380> know<00:00:27.740> but<00:00:28.070> yes<00:00:28.280> there

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
engineering I don't know but yes there

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.910 
engineering I don't know but yes there
we<00:00:28.580> go<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.020> this<00:00:30.020> is<00:00:30.260> what<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.530> 90<00:00:30.830> horsepower

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
we go and this is what a 90 horsepower

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.589 
we go and this is what a 90 horsepower
so<00:00:31.369> it's<00:00:31.520> not<00:00:31.699> exactly<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.090> most<00:00:32.210> powerful

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
so it's not exactly the most powerful

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.250 
so it's not exactly the most powerful
car<00:00:32.750> we've<00:00:32.840> ever<00:00:32.960> had

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
car we've ever had

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.640 
car we've ever had
but<00:00:33.680> anyway<00:00:34.070> 2100<00:00:35.059> pounds<00:00:35.270> it's<00:00:36.170> also<00:00:36.260> one<00:00:36.620> of

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
but anyway 2100 pounds it's also one of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.830 
but anyway 2100 pounds it's also one of
the<00:00:36.890> first<00:00:37.100> hot<00:00:37.370> hatches<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:38.059> were<00:00:38.660> ever

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
the first hot hatches that were ever

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.030 
the first hot hatches that were ever
made<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.140> not<00:00:39.230> quite<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> first<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:39.920> but

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
made it's not quite the first one but

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.799 
made it's not quite the first one but
it's<00:00:40.160> one<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.400> very<00:00:40.550> early<00:00:40.790> ones<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.659> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
it's one of the very early ones so the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.509 
it's one of the very early ones so the
pros<00:00:42.050> on<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:42.559> actually<00:00:42.830> a<00:00:42.860> very<00:00:43.129> fun

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
pros on this it's actually a very fun

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.490 
pros on this it's actually a very fun
car<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.820> drive<00:00:43.970> it's<00:00:44.750> not<00:00:44.900> particularly<00:00:45.140> fast

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
car to drive it's not particularly fast

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.810 
car to drive it's not particularly fast
but<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.800> can<00:00:45.920> sort<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.100> check<00:00:46.280> it<00:00:46.400> about<00:00:46.580> into

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
but you can sort of check it about into

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.149 
but you can sort of check it about into
corners<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.330> it's<00:00:48.229> just<00:00:48.470> all<00:00:48.620> yeah<00:00:48.739> good<00:00:48.949> fun

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
corners and it's just all yeah good fun

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.500 
corners and it's just all yeah good fun
to<00:00:49.250> drive<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.489> also<00:00:49.670> relatively<00:00:50.120> cheap<00:00:50.330> five

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
to drive it's also relatively cheap five

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.840 
to drive it's also relatively cheap five
thousand<00:00:50.870> credits<00:00:51.140> isn't<00:00:51.680> exactly<00:00:51.949> much<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
thousand credits isn't exactly much the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.759 
thousand credits isn't exactly much the
cons<00:00:53.089> well<00:00:53.479> it<00:00:53.720> is<00:00:53.839> an<00:00:53.960> F<00:00:54.080> class<00:00:54.260> car<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
cons well it is an F class car and

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.270 
cons well it is an F class car and
overall<00:00:55.100> isn't<00:00:55.280> particularly<00:00:56.150> fast<00:00:56.979> but<00:00:57.979> yeah

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
overall isn't particularly fast but yeah

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.640 
overall isn't particularly fast but yeah
it<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.909> is<00:00:59.030> fun<00:00:59.299> to<00:00:59.510> drive<00:00:59.690> pretty<00:01:00.350> more<00:01:00.530> and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
it is it is fun to drive pretty more and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.910 
it is it is fun to drive pretty more and
fast<00:01:00.830> so<00:01:01.129> that's<00:01:01.309> kind<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.580> okay<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.229> getting

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
fast so that's kind of okay so getting

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.700 
fast so that's kind of okay so getting
this<00:01:04.010> kind<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.280> role<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:05.049> rather<00:01:06.049> tricky<00:01:06.380> much

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
this kind of role is rather tricky much

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.510 
this kind of role is rather tricky much
like<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.729> Beatles<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.110> KA<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.130> lack<00:01:10.369> of

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
like the Beatles and the KA the lack of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.760 
like the Beatles and the KA the lack of
speed<00:01:10.850> does<00:01:11.180> kind<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.869> prove<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.260> :<00:01:12.530> that's<00:01:12.650> it

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
speed does kind of prove it : that's it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.650 
speed does kind of prove it : that's it
I<00:01:12.860> even<00:01:13.070> try<00:01:13.190> using<00:01:13.520> another<00:01:13.730> curb<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.450> get<00:01:14.600> it

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
I even try using another curb to get it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.910 
I even try using another curb to get it
to<00:01:14.720> roller<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.200> managed<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.590> get<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.740> massive

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
to roller then managed to get a massive

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.890 
to roller then managed to get a massive
tank<00:01:16.220> slapper<00:01:16.400> going<00:01:16.790> look<00:01:17.480> what<00:01:17.570> I<00:01:17.600> have<00:01:17.810> on

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
tank slapper going look what I have on

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.450 
tank slapper going look what I have on
that<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.170> but<00:01:18.320> yes<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.100> isn't<00:01:19.280> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
that one but yes and it isn't the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.850 
that one but yes and it isn't the
fastest<00:01:19.880> car<00:01:20.090> in<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.510> world<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.080> because<00:01:21.770> it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
fastest car in the world and because it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.010 
fastest car in the world and because it
is<00:01:21.890> on<00:01:22.100> road<00:01:22.550> suspension<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:23.690> should

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
is on road suspension I just should

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.590 
is on road suspension I just should
point<00:01:24.170> out<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:24.470> car<00:01:24.620> here<00:01:24.800> is<00:01:24.830> standard<00:01:25.600> yeah

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
point out this car here is standard yeah

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.360 
point out this car here is standard yeah
it<00:01:26.810> was<00:01:27.110> kind<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.470> difficult<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.920> got<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.190> two

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
it was kind of difficult it got on two

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.520 
it was kind of difficult it got on two
wheels<00:01:28.580> which<00:01:29.420> made<00:01:29.990> me<00:01:30.080> think<00:01:30.110> that<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.440> was

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
wheels which made me think that it was

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.000 
wheels which made me think that it was
quite<00:01:30.650> possible<00:01:30.710> doing<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.310> standard<00:01:31.700> and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
quite possible doing this a standard and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.490 
quite possible doing this a standard and
yeah<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.160> lack<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.700> speed<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.380> sort<00:01:36.380> of

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
yeah the lack of speed is sort of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.350 
yeah the lack of speed is sort of
problematic<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:37.490> Guess's<00:01:37.700> again<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.180> see

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
problematic now Guess's again you see

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.630 
problematic now Guess's again you see
there<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.870> quite<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.860> quite<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> lot<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.430> a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
there is quite it's quite a lot of a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.160 
there is quite it's quite a lot of a
suspension<00:01:41.030> travel<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.540> car<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
suspension travel in this car the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.410 
suspension travel in this car the
suspension<00:01:42.470> must<00:01:42.770> mean<00:01:42.980> very<00:01:43.820> very<00:01:44.060> soft<00:01:44.270> on

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
suspension must mean very very soft on

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.510 
suspension must mean very very soft on
it<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.470> yes<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.980> didn't<00:01:46.190> actually<00:01:46.280> take

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it and but yes it didn't actually take

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.710 
it and but yes it didn't actually take
as<00:01:46.610> long<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.760> I<00:01:46.880> was<00:01:46.970> expecting<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.330> roll<00:01:47.600> this

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
as long as I was expecting to roll this

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.290 
as long as I was expecting to roll this
thing<00:01:47.870> standard<00:01:48.260> here<00:01:48.410> we<00:01:48.470> go<00:01:48.620> that's<00:01:49.430> rolled

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
thing standard here we go that's rolled

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.790 
thing standard here we go that's rolled
and<00:01:50.600> now<00:01:50.870> we're<00:01:51.020> gonna<00:01:51.140> through<00:01:51.470> multiple

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
and now we're gonna through multiple

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.550 
and now we're gonna through multiple
rolls<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:53.510> on<00:01:53.600> its<00:01:53.810> star<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.200> didn't

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
rolls and it so on its star I didn't

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.080 
rolls and it so on its star I didn't
quite<00:01:54.650> land<00:01:54.770> on<00:01:54.890> its<00:01:55.010> wheels<00:01:55.190> oh<00:01:55.370> yes<00:01:55.909> there

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
quite land on its wheels oh yes there

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.880 
quite land on its wheels oh yes there
has<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.540> pw<00:01:57.080> rabbit<00:01:57.320> roll<00:01:57.470> completely

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
has to pw rabbit roll completely

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.770 
has to pw rabbit roll completely
standard<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.430> didn't<00:01:59.000> take<00:01:59.090> anywhere<00:01:59.390> near<00:01:59.630> as

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
standard I didn't take anywhere near as

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.030 
standard I didn't take anywhere near as
long<00:01:59.840> as<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:00.020> was<00:02:00.080> expecting<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.500> roll<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.860> one

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
long as I was expecting to roll that one

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.180 
long as I was expecting to roll that one
despite<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.960> speed<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.470> there<00:02:03.620> we<00:02:03.710> go

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
despite it's a speed but there we go

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.040 
despite it's a speed but there we go
I'm<00:02:04.610> quite<00:02:04.850> quite<00:02:05.180> pleased<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.840> I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
I'm quite quite pleased with that one I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.999 
I'm quite quite pleased with that one I
have<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.740> say<00:02:06.920> now<00:02:07.959> up<00:02:08.959> next<00:02:09.259> we<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.679> got<00:02:09.890> this

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
have to say now up next we have got this

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.960 
have to say now up next we have got this
this<00:02:10.069> one<00:02:10.340> has<00:02:10.429> been<00:02:10.580> one<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.789> most

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
this one has been one of the most

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.149 
this one has been one of the most
requested<00:02:11.090> cars<00:02:11.599> we've<00:02:12.290> had<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> PCAT

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
requested cars we've had it is the PCAT

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.729 
requested cars we've had it is the PCAT
Iver<00:02:13.489> on<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.909> don't<00:02:14.360> have<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.780> Super<00:02:15.080> Sport<00:02:15.170> DLC

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
Iver on I don't have the Super Sport DLC

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.380 
Iver on I don't have the Super Sport DLC
so<00:02:16.489> we're<00:02:16.909> just<00:02:16.939> rolling<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.049> standard<00:02:18.349> one

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
so we're just rolling the standard one

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
so we're just rolling the standard one
987<00:02:20.390> horsepower<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.590> quite<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.799> lot

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
987 horsepower because we quite a lot

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.770 
987 horsepower because we quite a lot
though<00:02:22.129> 4,400<00:02:23.090> pounds

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
though 4,400 pounds

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.380 
though 4,400 pounds
yeah<00:02:24.769> I'm<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.069> particular<00:02:25.640> very<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.269> to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
yeah I'm not particular very I have to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.089 
yeah I'm not particular very I have to
say<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.599> can't<00:02:27.079> really<00:02:27.170> explain<00:02:27.290> why<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.799> just

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
say I can't really explain why I just

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.640 
say I can't really explain why I just
don't<00:02:28.280> particularly<00:02:28.849> like<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.200> pros<00:02:30.409> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
don't particularly like it the pros to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.410 
don't particularly like it the pros to
it<00:02:30.739> are<00:02:30.860> well<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.220> incredibly<00:02:31.939> fast<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.360> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
it are well it's incredibly fast in a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.059 
it are well it's incredibly fast in a
straight<00:02:32.450> line<00:02:32.840> we<00:02:33.019> all<00:02:33.140> know<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
straight line we all know that and the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.500 
straight line we all know that and the
acceleration<00:02:34.519> is<00:02:34.760> phenomenal<00:02:35.269> as<00:02:35.360> well

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
acceleration is phenomenal as well

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.149 
acceleration is phenomenal as well
because<00:02:36.079> it's<00:02:36.230> about<00:02:36.440> its<00:02:36.590> four-wheel<00:02:36.950> drive

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
because it's about its four-wheel drive

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.819 
because it's about its four-wheel drive
the<00:02:37.849> cons<00:02:38.120> are<00:02:38.450> well<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.079> not<00:02:39.290> really<00:02:39.799> that

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
the cons are well it's not really that

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.890 
the cons are well it's not really that
nice<00:02:40.250> or<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> car<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.790> drive<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.480> handling

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
nice or a car to drive the handling

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.589 
nice or a car to drive the handling
isn't<00:02:42.079> really<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:42.920> good<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.489> can't<00:02:43.730> can't

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
isn't really that good and I can't can't

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.759 
isn't really that good and I can't can't
really<00:02:44.750> tell<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.079> because<00:02:45.379> it

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
really tell you it's just because it

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.649 
really tell you it's just because it
accelerates<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.370> fast<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.359> it<00:02:47.480> kind<00:02:47.629> of

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
accelerates so fast that it kind of

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.759 
accelerates so fast that it kind of
catches<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.140> out<00:02:48.170> where<00:02:48.409> you<00:02:48.470> need<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.709> start

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
catches you out where you need to start

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.619 
catches you out where you need to start
braking<00:02:49.220> four<00:02:49.340> corners<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.609> stuff<00:02:49.819> but<00:02:50.420> yeah

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
braking four corners and stuff but yeah

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.899 
braking four corners and stuff but yeah
that<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> handling<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.980> not<00:02:52.400> quite<00:02:52.640> as

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
that the handling is just not quite as

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.119 
that the handling is just not quite as
good<00:02:53.090> as<00:02:53.420> I'd<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.470> if<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.650> was<00:02:54.739> pretty

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
good as I'd like if I was pretty

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.890 
good as I'd like if I was pretty
terrible<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.329> guess<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.629> do<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.840> a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
terrible is I guess it to do with a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.199 
terrible is I guess it to do with a
four-wheel<00:02:57.170> drive<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.680> extra<00:02:57.950> white<00:02:58.209> it's

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
four-wheel drive in the extra white it's

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.910 
four-wheel drive in the extra white it's
sort<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.359> a<00:02:59.450> man<00:02:59.569> thusly<00:02:59.780> distinct<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.349> caring

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
sort of a man thusly distinct and caring

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.559 
sort of a man thusly distinct and caring
now<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.400> there<00:03:01.849> are<00:03:02.000> some<00:03:02.150> real<00:03:02.359> problems

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
now this there are some real problems

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.530 
now this there are some real problems
we're<00:03:02.870> trying<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.079> get<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.260> car<00:03:03.409> to<00:03:03.470> roll

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
we're trying to get this car to roll

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.640 
we're trying to get this car to roll
much<00:03:05.540> like<00:03:05.780> with<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.959> Aston<00:03:06.230> Martin<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
much like with the Aston Martin and the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.280 
much like with the Aston Martin and the
NASCAR<00:03:07.129> we<00:03:07.280> had<00:03:07.459> last<00:03:08.180> week<00:03:08.510> when<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.109> go<00:03:09.230> to

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
NASCAR we had last week when you go to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.750 
NASCAR we had last week when you go to
take<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> corners<00:03:09.859> normally<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.519> would<00:03:10.609> take

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
take the corners normally you would take

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.819 
take the corners normally you would take
it<00:03:10.879> flat<00:03:11.090> out<00:03:11.120> that's<00:03:12.109> what's<00:03:12.260> doing<00:03:12.379> most<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
it flat out that's what's doing most the

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.740 
it flat out that's what's doing most the
cars<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.670> we've<00:03:13.819> been<00:03:14.000> trying<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.299> roll<00:03:14.540> here

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
cars that we've been trying to roll here

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.240 
cars that we've been trying to roll here
and<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.109> racing<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.530> take<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.739> fan<00:03:15.920> as<00:03:16.069> well

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
and in racing you take a fan as well

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.970 
and in racing you take a fan as well
problem<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.510> very<00:03:17.690> one<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.230> fast<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
problem is the very one is so fast that

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.369 
problem is the very one is so fast that
it<00:03:19.879> does<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.299> if<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.720> take<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.019> with<00:03:21.139> any

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
it does that if you take it with any

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.439 
it does that if you take it with any
speed<00:03:21.769> is<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.220> fast<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.639> so<00:03:22.879> little<00:03:23.030> turning

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
speed is so fast and so little turning

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.569 
speed is so fast and so little turning
but<00:03:24.049> if<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.319> take<00:03:24.500> any<00:03:24.680> sort<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.040> speed<00:03:25.340> into

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
but if you take any sort of speed into

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.030 
but if you take any sort of speed into
the<00:03:25.699> corner<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.690> just<00:03:27.049> go<00:03:27.620> at<00:03:27.739> you're<00:03:27.889> gonna

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the corner you just go at you're gonna

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.800 
the corner you just go at you're gonna
hit<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.220> wall<00:03:28.459> which<00:03:29.150> means<00:03:29.389> that<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.569> was<00:03:29.720> having

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
hit a wall which means that I was having

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.629 
hit a wall which means that I was having
to<00:03:29.989> try<00:03:30.169> and<00:03:30.199> take<00:03:30.379> it<00:03:30.440> slower<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.040> avoid<00:03:31.310> keep

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
to try and take it slower to avoid keep

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.250 
to try and take it slower to avoid keep

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.629 
trying to kind of take this corner a
little<00:03:42.709> bit<00:03:42.799> slower<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.099> you<00:03:43.310> could<00:03:43.489> actually

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
little bit slower so you could actually

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.849 
little bit slower so you could actually
get<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.060> car<00:03:44.239> around<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.440> just<00:03:45.680> did

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
this is sort of about ninety a hundred

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.740 
this is sort of about ninety a hundred
miles<00:03:59.190> an<00:03:59.400> hour<00:03:59.489> trying<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.849> roll<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
miles an hour trying to roll it and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.500 
miles an hour trying to roll it and
somehow<00:04:01.379> I<00:04:01.500> managed

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
somehow I managed

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.830 
somehow I managed
spun<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.629> there<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:05.700> yeah<00:04:05.849> that's<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> sort

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
spun it there but yeah that's the sort

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.699 
spun it there but yeah that's the sort
of<00:04:06.870> piece<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.230> were<00:04:07.290> looking<00:04:07.379> at<00:04:07.560> mean

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
of piece that we were looking at mean

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.100 
of piece that we were looking at mean
the<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.580> rabbit<00:04:08.910> rolled<00:04:09.150> up<00:04:09.510> what<00:04:09.930> was<00:04:10.019> that

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
the the rabbit rolled up what was that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990 
the the rabbit rolled up what was that
doing<00:04:10.290> 50<00:04:10.799> 60<00:04:11.190> miles<00:04:11.370> an<00:04:11.489> hour<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.730> think<00:04:11.849> it

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
doing 50 60 miles an hour I think it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.229 
doing 50 60 miles an hour I think it
probably<00:04:12.090> near<00:04:12.480> 60<00:04:12.840> or<00:04:12.959> 70<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:14.060> there<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.150> go

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
probably near 60 or 70 but there we go

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.000 
probably near 60 or 70 but there we go
that's<00:04:15.629> just<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> Veyrons<00:04:16.290> do<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
that's just what the Veyrons do it it's

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.620 
that's just what the Veyrons do it it's
just<00:04:17.160> sort<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:18.000> over<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> curb<00:04:18.389> and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
just sort of going over the curb and

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.330 
just sort of going over the curb and
yeah<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.560> was<00:04:19.620> time<00:04:19.769> for<00:04:19.889> some<00:04:20.010> upgrades

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
hit the wall and hit that tire by not

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.980 
hit the wall and hit that tire by not
pretty<00:04:41.190> hard<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.610> did<00:04:42.000> trifle<00:04:42.419> out<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.539> few<00:04:42.780> times

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
pretty hard I did trifle out a few times

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.420 
pretty hard I did trifle out a few times
with<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.350> I've<00:04:43.470> modified<00:04:43.770> one<00:04:44.010> it's<00:04:44.160> still<00:04:44.280> in

so there we go that is a very run being

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.860 
so there we go that is a very run being
flung<00:04:47.789> at<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:47.970> wall<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.419> did<00:04:48.570> manage<00:04:48.750> to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
flung at the wall and it did manage to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.000 
flung at the wall and it did manage to
roll<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.169> even<00:04:49.350> did<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.500> front<00:04:49.620> flip<00:04:49.710> off<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
roll it even did a front flip off the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.400 
roll it even did a front flip off the
hit<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.340> tire<00:04:50.550> oh<00:04:50.699> there<00:04:51.630> we<00:04:51.750> go<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:52.050> final

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
hit the tire oh there we go the final

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.760 
hit the tire oh there we go the final
car<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> Dodge<00:04:54.150> Ram<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:55.139> think<00:04:55.650> quite

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
car is this is a Dodge Ram I think quite

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.840 
car is this is a Dodge Ram I think quite
a<00:04:55.830> lot<00:04:55.919> of<00:04:55.950> people<00:04:56.130> were<00:04:56.190> suggested<00:04:56.580> pickup

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
a lot of people were suggested pickup

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.610 
a lot of people were suggested pickup
trucks<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.360> someone<00:04:57.900> was<00:04:57.990> suggesting<00:04:58.320> around

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
trucks and someone was suggesting around

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.670 
trucks and someone was suggesting around
so<00:04:58.979> I<00:04:59.010> went<00:04:59.550> for<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.700> Dodge<00:04:59.880> Ram<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.530> I'm<00:05:01.530> not

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
so I went for the Dodge Ram and I'm not

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.890 
so I went for the Dodge Ram and I'm not
really<00:05:01.770> sure<00:05:01.979> why<00:05:02.160> over<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:02.880> Salina<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.330> got

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
really sure why over the Salina I got

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.379 
really sure why over the Salina I got
like<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.139> Dodge<00:05:04.260> Ram<00:05:04.789> okay<00:05:05.789> so<00:05:05.849> what<00:05:06.240> do<00:05:06.300> we

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
like the Dodge Ram okay so what do we

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.060 
like the Dodge Ram okay so what do we
got<00:05:06.510> for<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.720> round<00:05:06.900> it's<00:05:06.990> 500<00:05:07.470> horse<00:05:07.650> which

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
got for the round it's 500 horse which

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.620 
got for the round it's 500 horse which
makes<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.460> quite<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.700> bloomin<00:05:09.060> powerful<00:05:09.450> I

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
makes it quite a bloomin powerful I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.120 
makes it quite a bloomin powerful I
think<00:05:10.110> that's<00:05:10.500> why<00:05:10.590> quite<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> lot

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
think that's why quite a lot

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.010 
think that's why quite a lot
five<00:05:11.400> thousand<00:05:11.820> one<00:05:11.880> hundred<00:05:12.060> pounds<00:05:12.599> which

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
five thousand one hundred pounds which

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.629 
five thousand one hundred pounds which
makes<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.620> second<00:05:14.130> heaviest<00:05:14.430> thing<00:05:14.580> I've

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
makes it the second heaviest thing I've

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.940 
makes it the second heaviest thing I've
ever<00:05:14.729> had<00:05:14.940> behind<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.419> hammer<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.900> pros<00:05:16.770> on

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
ever had behind the hammer the pros on

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.680 
ever had behind the hammer the pros on
this<00:05:17.190> well<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.580> could<00:05:17.820> just<00:05:18.090> about<00:05:18.330> carry

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
this well it could just about carry

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.930 
this well it could just about carry
anything<00:05:19.050> it<00:05:19.169> is<00:05:19.200> humongous<00:05:20.039> it's<00:05:20.789> also<00:05:20.880> a

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
anything it is humongous it's also a

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.610 
anything it is humongous it's also a
relatively<00:05:21.450> fast<00:05:21.810> considering<00:05:22.289> this<00:05:22.470> is<00:05:22.590> a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
relatively fast considering this is a

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.650 
relatively fast considering this is a
huge<00:05:23.099> pickup<00:05:23.430> truck<00:05:23.669> it's<00:05:24.090> top<00:05:24.270> speed<00:05:24.510> like

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
huge pickup truck it's top speed like

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.540 
huge pickup truck it's top speed like
160<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:27.090> cons<00:05:27.360> are<00:05:27.570> well<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.889> very<00:05:29.190> very

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
160 the cons are well it is very very

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.150 
160 the cons are well it is very very
very<00:05:29.820> big<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.320> one<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.440> these<00:05:31.530> wouldn't<00:05:31.950> fit

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
very big and one of these wouldn't fit

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.100 
very big and one of these wouldn't fit
down<00:05:32.310> most<00:05:32.580> English<00:05:32.970> roads<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.479> don't<00:05:34.020> even

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
down most English roads I don't even

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.600 
down most English roads I don't even
think<00:05:34.260> one<00:05:34.530> would<00:05:34.620> fit<00:05:34.860> down<00:05:34.979> where<00:05:35.160> Road

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
think one would fit down where Road

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.520 
think one would fit down where Road
where<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.789> live<00:05:36.150> it's<00:05:36.570> they're<00:05:36.690> just<00:05:36.870> humongous

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
where I live it's they're just humongous

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.879 
where I live it's they're just humongous
things<00:05:37.979> however<00:05:38.639> for<00:05:39.060> rolling<00:05:39.450> well<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:40.380> not

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
things however for rolling well it's not

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.440 
things however for rolling well it's not
going<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.190> be<00:05:41.250> particularly<00:05:41.520> hard<00:05:41.849> and<00:05:42.360> this

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
going to be particularly hard and this

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.330 
going to be particularly hard and this
is<00:05:42.510> my<00:05:42.599> first<00:05:42.960> attempt<00:05:43.349> with<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.800> there<00:05:44.250> we

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
is my first attempt with it and there we

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.730 
is my first attempt with it and there we
go<00:05:44.490> yes<00:05:44.700> lesson<00:05:45.360> mean<00:05:46.200> he<00:05:46.260> went<00:05:46.410> over<00:05:46.650> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
go yes lesson mean he went over the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.670 
go yes lesson mean he went over the
first<00:05:46.919> time<00:05:47.039> it<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.550> very<00:05:47.639> tall<00:05:48.060> car<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.680> so

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
first time it is a very tall car and so

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.990 
first time it is a very tall car and so
the<00:05:49.830> center<00:05:50.010> of<00:05:50.160> gravity<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.639> quite<00:05:50.820> high

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
the center of gravity is quite high

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820 
the center of gravity is quite high
making<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:51.900> pretty<00:05:52.380> easy<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.650> roll<00:05:52.800> over

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
making this pretty easy to roll over

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.279 
making this pretty easy to roll over
he's<00:05:53.099> also<00:05:53.220> very<00:05:53.490> very<00:05:53.610> fast<00:05:53.970> so<00:05:54.599> I<00:05:54.630> was<00:05:54.840> going

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
he's also very very fast so I was going

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.719 
he's also very very fast so I was going
back<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.470> sort<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:55.830> set<00:05:55.950> up<00:05:56.039> my<00:05:56.099> second<00:05:56.400> run<00:05:56.520> and

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
back to sort of set up my second run and

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.190 
back to sort of set up my second run and
I<00:05:56.789> managed<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.090> first<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.659> that<00:05:57.750> was<00:05:57.840> rolling

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
I managed to first and that was rolling

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.070 
I managed to first and that was rolling
off<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.409> completely<00:05:59.070> different<00:05:59.219> curb<00:05:59.990> here<00:06:00.990> we

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
off a completely different curb here we

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.189 
off a completely different curb here we
go

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
go

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.959 
go
I<00:06:02.229> hadn't<00:06:02.800> seen<00:06:03.069> that<00:06:03.099> curve<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.550> few<00:06:03.729> times

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
I hadn't seen that curve a few times

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.519 
I hadn't seen that curve a few times
there<00:06:04.300> was<00:06:04.569> I<00:06:04.779> was<00:06:04.960> wondering<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.259> forget<00:06:05.499> a

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
there was I was wondering to forget a

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.390 
there was I was wondering to forget a
car<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.800> roll<00:06:05.949> off<00:06:06.099> it<00:06:06.279> and<00:06:06.400> the<00:06:07.210> Dodge<00:06:07.389> Ram

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
car to roll off it and the Dodge Ram

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.679 
car to roll off it and the Dodge Ram
succeeded<00:06:09.400> in<00:06:09.669> falling<00:06:10.300> off<00:06:10.389> a<00:06:10.449> different

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689 
succeeded in falling off a different

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.320 
succeeded in falling off a different
curve<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.289> there<00:06:11.529> we<00:06:11.620> go<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:12.370> is<00:06:12.400> all<00:06:12.999> three

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
curve so there we go that is all three

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.689 
curve so there we go that is all three
cars<00:06:13.569> rolled<00:06:14.319> today<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:15.009> still<00:06:15.430> nothing

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
cars rolled today and still nothing

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:16.830 
cars rolled today and still nothing
beyond<00:06:15.939> me<00:06:16.029> and<00:06:16.060> most<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.419> these<00:06:16.479> cars<00:06:16.719> were

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
beyond me and most of these cars were

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.540 
beyond me and most of these cars were
kept<00:06:16.990> standard<00:06:17.439> except<00:06:17.949> for<00:06:18.069> the<00:06:18.129> viral<00:06:18.430> that

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
kept standard except for the viral that

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.959 
kept standard except for the viral that
was<00:06:18.669> slightly<00:06:18.849> modified<00:06:20.279> so<00:06:21.279> yes<00:06:21.520> sorry<00:06:21.789> I'm

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
was slightly modified so yes sorry I'm

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.089 
was slightly modified so yes sorry I'm
slightly<00:06:22.330> dying<00:06:22.599> I<00:06:22.779> don't<00:06:22.960> know<00:06:23.020> something

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
slightly dying I don't know something

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.679 
slightly dying I don't know something
I<00:06:24.129> hope<00:06:24.430> they<00:06:24.669> will<00:06:24.999> leave<00:06:25.150> you<00:06:25.240> with<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.419> super

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
I hope they will leave you with a super

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.330 
I hope they will leave you with a super
slow-mo<00:06:25.990> of<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.169> ramp<00:06:26.379> mainly<00:06:27.039> because<00:06:27.159> this

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
slow-mo of the ramp mainly because this

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
slow-mo of the ramp mainly because this
is<00:06:27.460> the<00:06:27.550> only<00:06:27.699> one<00:06:27.789> where<00:06:27.909> the<00:06:27.999> camera<00:06:28.240> doesn't

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
is the only one where the camera doesn't

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.420 
is the only one where the camera doesn't
get<00:06:28.539> stuck<00:06:28.719> behind<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.080> fence<00:06:29.259> for<00:06:30.069> next<00:06:30.279> week
