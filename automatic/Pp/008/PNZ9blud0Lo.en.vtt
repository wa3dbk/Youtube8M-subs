00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.720
 hello and welcome to blow side of 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.490
 still a cooler still a top flow 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.770
 this time we go to thermalright 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.160
 with the appearance of cyan in muscle version 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.380
 so thanks to the muscles we have a 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.780
 red box but surprisingly we have 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.020
 a white fan and black 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.450
 fan 140 mm with fasteners 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.460
 120 that will turn 2,700 to 1,300 turns 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.570
 per minute only then it's 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.489
 cynicism that will make some noise 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.290
 necessarily but the speed of rotation 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.940
 is not very high on the other hand 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.710
 might have dreamed that it's coming down a 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.269
 little more package set without having nevertheless 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.489
 at the performance level of course 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.879
 and noise pollution performance by 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.370
 compared to the size of the radiator that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.460
 measures 60 mm high fan no 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.630
 including we add 13 mm 14 mm to little 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 it still remains reasonable 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.900
 Comes in a lot of compact housing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.880
 we have six heat pipes a finish these 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.420
 terms a light we want to say that's 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.640
 very clean 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.740
 it's almost perfect so for the test 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.970
 980x of course without overclocking and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.340
 with overclocking we will try to 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.759
 push hard but not sure that it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 works we will bring out our little ones 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.130
 mini-itx motherboards to do a test 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:45.460
 very fast then we start with our 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:48.630
 asus then there we see pretty much 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.840
 heard that did not necessarily arise 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.049
 correctly that normally it touches 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.630
 at the PCI Express 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.310
 that's the base then seems pretty much 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.380
 center and there it does not pass and like 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.780
 these should pass pci express 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.190
 available supply stage no 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 problem is at the level of memory 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.670
 as often then if we raise like 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.350
 if we see 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.910
 we have a cutout so we should 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 still be memory with 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.790
 maybe a small radiator 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:27.650
 we recover our zotac 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.120
 and then there we do very classic 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 pose like those here the memory again a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.609
 times with a notch that should not 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.689
 to be blocked and if one poses in this sense 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:42.950
 pci express blocked so the choice is 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.510
 imposed so inevitably there is no 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.340
 really of choice but we can 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.989
 install it a priori on a lot of 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.650
 configuration as often at 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.430
 thermalright knew we found here a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.230
 small bar that allows radiators 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.250
 simply not to sink 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.349
 we press on it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.159
 the test we deal with it very quickly 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.159
 and we wish you a good day
