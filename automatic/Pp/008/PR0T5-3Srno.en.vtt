00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 the last thing we're going to see now is the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 accompaniment know how it accompanies the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.450
 strength as after the blow after 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.239
 of the impact that you hit with few 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.190
 differences there is an accompaniment that is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.480
 the extension of the impulse to see how 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.480
 is the accompaniment 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.850
 is correct the one behind the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.640
 ball that we have already seen that its 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.620
 Accompaniment is unique 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.130
 the difference of the accompaniments 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:21.290
 as before it will always depend on the impact 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.260
 if I hit the ball with the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.659
 equal breaks 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.670
 it's the plane 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:34.789
 this is how the accompaniment has always been 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.729
 will be from the outside in as well as if 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.070
 I did 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.330
 as if I wanted to study the body is a 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.220
 different accompaniment and difference 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 is that the accompaniment is a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.610
 population to the right so 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.740
 so to the right this would 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.800
 so that the ball bounces to the right 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.430
 they are three different accompaniments only 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.530
 you do the basic that is the plane but 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.020
 as I said it 's good just now 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.720
 you should be taught to cut well and to 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.970
 shoot well and at the end the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.100
 completion that is the search for 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.000
 balance to see how you stay after 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.000
 to finish the blow 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.170
 to see it to see it well we are going to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.280
 simulate that you make a point from here and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.350
 then you take out 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.670
 the ball enters but not between you still 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.830
 the point but to your right to a reverse 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.220
 or the ball half track what you want 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.940
 seven balls you finish the point is worth what 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.870
 you finish image 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.880
 imaginary have ever done this 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.880
 well the plastics all this kind of 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.180
 they are shadows but as if you were 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.180
 playing with the same intensity father 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.580
 I'm very nearly in the classroom notice that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.460
 almost within your technique be 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.850
 established stereotyped since this 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.790
 is chosen has the habit of raising 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.490
 sometimes and catch the ball you know that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.970
 it's not going to go well and almost the ball is thrown 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.830
 and you're already waiting for the run I do not know 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.500
 how many times have I seen in the time that 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.450
 we are here to do that 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.870
 45 times is too much that's the lack of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.180
 confidence that you have in putting the ball 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.470
 on your site a person who puts the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.470
 ball your level never does 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.270
 never juan carlos cubas and all this 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.270
 many times this 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.870
 this has not been done many times because 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.870
 you have confidence in your hand 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.200
 ah
