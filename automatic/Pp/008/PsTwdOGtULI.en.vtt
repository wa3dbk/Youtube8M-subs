this<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:19.409> offset<00:01:19.979> post<00:01:20.750> 365<00:01:21.750> maybe

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this is a back offset post 365 maybe

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
this is a back offset post 365 maybe
closer<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.650> 350<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.369> sure<00:01:23.520> exactly<00:01:23.729> where

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
closer to 350 I'm not sure exactly where

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
closer to 350 I'm not sure exactly where
it<00:01:24.150> was<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.650> side<00:01:25.860> view<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it was but just a side view so you can

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
kind of see me hitting depth there and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.710 
kind of see me hitting depth there and
this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.860> another<00:01:29.460> set<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> 3<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> said<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

according to my program I just do back

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
according to my program I just do back
offsets<00:01:36.060> until<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.720> feel<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.530> can't<00:01:37.770> hit

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890

anymore<00:01:38.130> sets<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.610> 3<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.360> percentage<00:01:39.899> so

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
anymore sets of 3 at this percentage so

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.580

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.849 
dining a few more weeks I actually
started<00:03:31.870> testing<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> water<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.739> seeing

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
started testing the water and seeing

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.289 
started testing the water and seeing
where<00:03:33.040> my<00:03:33.069> strengths<00:03:33.519> really<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.180> I'm

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
where my strengths really and I'm

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.720 
where my strengths really and I'm
actually<00:03:34.480> much<00:03:35.049> stronger<00:03:35.470> than<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.950> when<00:03:36.639> it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
actually much stronger than this when it

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.430 
actually much stronger than this when it
comes<00:03:36.910> down<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.750> even<00:03:37.989> on<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> lighter

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
comes down to it so even on a lighter

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.280 
comes down to it so even on a lighter
weight<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:40.000> happy<00:03:40.180> with<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.420> but

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
weight so I'm happy with that but

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.229 
weight so I'm happy with that but

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
first of all I do a conventional

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.180 
first of all I do a conventional
deadlift<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:01.989> more<00:04:02.260> back<00:04:02.620> focused<00:04:03.130> just

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
deadlift and it's more back focused just

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.039 
deadlift and it's more back focused just
the<00:04:03.459> way<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.579> do<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:04.030> just<00:04:04.269> works<00:04:04.480> just

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
the way I do it just works just

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.280 
the way I do it just works just
mechanically<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.889> me<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.190> works<00:04:06.340> best<00:04:07.290> and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
mechanically for me that works best and

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.440 
mechanically for me that works best and
two<00:04:09.040> it's<00:04:09.250> not<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.639> much<00:04:09.760> about<00:04:09.819> dropping<00:04:10.359> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
two it's not so much about dropping the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.420 
two it's not so much about dropping the
butt<00:04:10.660> as<00:04:10.840> much<00:04:11.260> as<00:04:11.440> finding<00:04:11.889> mechanically

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
butt as much as finding mechanically

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.879 
butt as much as finding mechanically
what<00:04:12.549> works<00:04:12.819> best<00:04:13.030> for<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:14.530> main<00:04:14.680> thing

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
what works best for you the main thing

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.099 
what works best for you the main thing
is<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.040> your<00:04:15.310> spine<00:04:15.579> stays<00:04:15.880> straight<00:04:16.299> that

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
is that your spine stays straight that

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
is that your spine stays straight that
you're<00:04:17.289> driving<00:04:17.440> through<00:04:17.769> your<00:04:17.889> heels<00:04:18.280> you're

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
you're driving through your heels you're

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.849 
you're driving through your heels you're
keeping<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.389> bar<00:04:19.570> close<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> at<00:04:20.829> all

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
keeping the bar close to you at all

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.930 
keeping the bar close to you at all
times<00:04:22.050> and<00:04:23.050> then<00:04:23.800> you're<00:04:23.919> being<00:04:24.099> as<00:04:24.490> efficient

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
times and then you're being as efficient

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.129 
times and then you're being as efficient
as<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.300> with<00:04:25.479> movement<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.020> know

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
as you can with movement you know

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.450 
as you can with movement you know
everybody's<00:04:26.590> got<00:04:26.620> different<00:04:27.039> leverages

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
everybody's got different leverages

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.110 
everybody's got different leverages
everybody's<00:04:28.210> got<00:04:28.360> different<00:04:28.690> proportions

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
everybody's got different proportions

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.279 
everybody's got different proportions
but<00:04:31.120> that's<00:04:31.390> just<00:04:31.570> what<00:04:31.780> works<00:04:31.960> for<00:04:32.080> me<00:04:32.200> I

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
but that's just what works for me I

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:32.559 
but that's just what works for me I
don't

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
don't

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.939 
don't
try<00:04:32.809> to<00:04:32.869> go<00:04:33.080> out<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.259> my<00:04:33.349> way<00:04:33.379> to<00:04:33.589> do<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
try to go out of my way to do that

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.249 
try to go out of my way to do that
that's<00:04:34.129> just<00:04:34.460> what<00:04:34.999> I<00:04:35.029> found<00:04:35.270> optimally<00:04:35.960> works

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
that's just what I found optimally works

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.139 
that's just what I found optimally works
for<00:04:36.529> me<00:04:37.479> yo<00:04:38.479> lo
