against the right edge of the foot you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
against the right edge of the foot you
will<00:00:58.469> need<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> prepare<00:00:58.949> bias<00:00:59.489> binding<00:00:59.730> strips

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
will need to prepare bias binding strips

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
will need to prepare bias binding strips
that<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.870> an<00:01:00.989> eighth<00:01:01.140> inch<00:01:01.410> wide<00:01:01.710> I

that are one in an eighth inch wide I
have<00:01:02.640> starched<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.149> fabric<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> give<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> some

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
have starched my fabric to give it some

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
have starched my fabric to give it some
body<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.250> feed<00:01:05.519> through<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
body so that it will feed through the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.300 
body so that it will feed through the
bios<00:01:06.210> binder<00:01:06.659> more<00:01:06.840> easily<00:01:07.200> you'll<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bios binder more easily you'll need to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
bios binder more easily you'll need to
feed<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.820> bias<00:01:09.030> strip<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> bios<00:01:10.200> binder

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
feed the bias strip into the bios binder

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
feed the bias strip into the bios binder
that's<00:01:11.189> done<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.670> easily<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.299> an<00:01:12.450> angled

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that's done more easily with an angled

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 
that's done more easily with an angled
and<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> insert<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and we're going to insert it into the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
and we're going to insert it into the
wide<00:01:15.540> part<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.380> bias<00:01:16.650> binder<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.909> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
project I'm going to put it on this pot

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
project I'm going to put it on this pot
holder<00:02:18.680> today<00:02:20.410> I've<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.890> laid<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.370> edge<00:02:22.520> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
holder today I've just laid the edge of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.680 
holder today I've just laid the edge of
the<00:02:22.880> pot<00:02:23.180> holder<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.840> groove<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> foot

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
the pot holder in the groove of the foot

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.880 
the pot holder in the groove of the foot
and<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.280> my<00:02:29.209> needle<00:02:29.570> has<00:02:29.780> been<00:02:30.080> moved<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.860> a

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
and so my needle has been moved to a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.280 
and so my needle has been moved to a
left<00:02:31.280> position<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.480> may<00:02:32.630> want<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.900> play<00:02:33.140> with

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
left position you may want to play with

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.610 
left position you may want to play with
that<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.430> your<00:02:35.090> needle<00:02:35.690> drops<00:02:35.959> exactly

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
that so that your needle drops exactly

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.699 
that so that your needle drops exactly
where<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.890> want<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:38.050> me<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.560> like

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
where you want it for me this is like

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.670 
where you want it for me this is like
magic

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680
