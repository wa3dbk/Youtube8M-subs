sorry I can see on the mini-map that
somebody<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.810> solid<00:03:59.139> I<00:03:59.230> try<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.500> throw<00:03:59.739> a

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
somebody to solid I try to throw a

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.050 
somebody to solid I try to throw a
grenade<00:03:59.919> and<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.340> think<00:04:00.519> he's<00:04:00.639> already<00:04:00.880> got

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
grenade and I think he's already got

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.690 
grenade and I think he's already got
killed<00:04:01.329> though

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
killed though

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.520 
killed though
and<00:04:02.849> this<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.540> little<00:04:03.870> Hill<00:04:04.170> here<00:04:04.200> you're<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
and this this little Hill here you're a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.990 
and this this little Hill here you're a
bit<00:04:04.650> exposed<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.550> quite<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> nice

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
bit exposed it can be quite a nice

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.320 
bit exposed it can be quite a nice
position<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.870> then<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.040> objective<00:04:08.489> with<00:04:09.060> I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
position to then be the objective with I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.140 
position to then be the objective with I
get<00:04:09.870> taken<00:04:10.260> out<00:04:10.379> there<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:11.640> enough<00:04:11.879> times

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
get taken out there I think enough times

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.380 
get taken out there I think enough times
past<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.660> think<00:04:12.870> we<00:04:12.959> actually<00:04:13.110> end<00:04:13.440> up<00:04:13.590> getting

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
past I think we actually end up getting

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.960 
past I think we actually end up getting
destruction<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.629> on<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:15.930> video<00:04:16.970> so

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
destruction of a on this video so

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.569 
destruction of a on this video so
hopefully<00:04:18.180> that's<00:04:18.480> provided<00:04:18.989> using<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:19.410> nice

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
hopefully that's provided using a nice

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.120 
hopefully that's provided using a nice
strategies<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:20.760> tactics<00:04:21.530> used<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:22.889> make
