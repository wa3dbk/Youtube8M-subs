00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.219
 military weapons firing techniques 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.520
 combat conditions different from technology 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.410
 shooting and sporting weapons in the dash then 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.220
 what's good just not on the shooting range 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.220
 good at war 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.700
 you see a shooting technique with a position 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.000
 lying with a belt 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.000
 pay attention to the gas on the store he 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.840
 relies on arm belt overlap not 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.739
 through the arm arm under the belt belt 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.290
 presses the magazine to the hand the same 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.670
 position at the front of the lesson arrow 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:53.960
 is strictly under the arms of the belt 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.700
 cross the elbow on the side pay 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 attention as a belt overlaps over 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.610
 shop and overlap the elbow 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.930
 the belt is tightened the belt works as a stop 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.510
 using hard stop do not shoot 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.030
 preferably here is the emphasis when fired 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 rifle here toss up and bullets 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:23.570
 accordingly go up too when 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.659
 sniper position is high 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.750
 grass and shoot lying down is not necessary 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.659
 apply the method of shooting from the knee 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.240
 with this method the upper part of the body 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.270
 the arrow works exactly the same as when 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.270
 prone position elbow rests on 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.729
 knee and elbow is building under 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.860
 a rifle 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.579
 heel is strictly under the knee all 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.130
 it forms a straight line draw 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.259
 attention to belt belt 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.720
 he overlaps his elbow and overlaps over 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.960
 the shop the whole brunt of the weapons falls 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 him 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.890
 Bedouin way of shooting top 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.500
 body arrow works exactly the same 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.920
 the weight of the weapon falls on the leg strap 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920
 in Turkish 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.750
 second Bedouin way 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.269
 shooting one foot pushed forward 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.950
 the elbow rests on it so that the arrow does not 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.019
 swinging left to the other leg 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.019
 horizontal position you can shoot 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.860
 when the position of the arrow is in 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.049
 scrub and shoot impossible not lying 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:53.819
 do not rock on the method of shooting 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:57.150
 standing while the store relies on the left 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.489
 hand he again overlaps the belt and 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.569
 the whole weight of the rifle falls on 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.569
 stretched belt 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.780
 rifle front view 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.659
 center of gravity arrow and his heels 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.099
 are on the same straight line this 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:24.209
 lines can not be broken otherwise rifle 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.209
 will flood right-left 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:36.659
 the belt is taut it allows the arrow 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.659
 shoot standing for quite a long time 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.349
 of time, too, he is stuck for 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.060
 shop and by the elbow 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.450
 strung up without a weapon falls on him 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.450
 can shoot
