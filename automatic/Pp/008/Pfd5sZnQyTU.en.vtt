00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 today you come back from me today 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.550
 again in unboxing and i was there 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 at media market and has me the first time 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.650
 roccat kone grabbed that she took the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 but not otherwise you have the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.920
 packaging and she has 8002 dpa this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 Function like disco keyboard here with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 pipes where we have two up and down 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.879
 we each have a different color 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 can light up 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.680
 then we have down here still with 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.170
 Information plays it a bit though 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.170
 here is only with roccat talk aim and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.079
 then advertised with the weights 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:03.300
 So it looks like a good mouse 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.399
 In the background you will see the friction or 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.420
 the box webber 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.860
 pinsafe black this is the new mouse pad 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.259
 I saw that there and thought so 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.709
 you take equal time with and tests 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 the whole thing out and I just want it 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:25.050
 Let's say we catch the mouse 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.030
 better from america and then 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:34.470
 Let's just cut that one down 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.619
 moment so Beck and what we first 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.130
 see here is the installation 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.500
 quick start guide belongs again 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.500
 fully into the top ten stands 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.700
 maybe there is not any more 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.240
 we'll see you soon 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 take a look at the mouse 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:13.299
 At the time , I also got her as me 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.230
 forgot is a moment that 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:20.849
 to record weights 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.849
 because this one in the small box inside 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:33.099
 it works or is not 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.660
 that were certainly how clearly so have there 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:43.090
 We then weigh the five weights 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:46.030
 fukushima camera that you get there or 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:52.079
 less is definitely here 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.079
 five grams on it and are four dishes 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.569
 here we have the optics tds i think 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.000
 almost the same structure as the one about 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.799
 I did not have any plus that personally 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.389
 had the roccat kova here by the way 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.000
 the laser and must say is big mouse 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.380
 not very good in hand here 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.049
 again the easy shift function and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.819
 prefaces beckford left mosters 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.870
 bill what haste for this button 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.519
 is I do not know you can 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.250
 probably also revive a lot 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.109
 move independently and then have 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.200
 Let's go two keys to the 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.900
 standard used by the dpi 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.419
 adjust 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.849
 then we come to the cable that you have 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.599
 its substances transformation of the knot 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.859
 to change 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:53.530
 which I personally like that very much 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.690
 annoying is opinion after then again the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.239
 usb usb 2.0 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.950
 Rocket is the same as I think 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.200
 remained 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.769
 writes me nothing in it to be further 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.420
 so then we make someone the imp 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:26.310
 purely formal has that somehow 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:29.220
 turn so lenz power tripod on xbox 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.970
 not quite perfect should play me 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.729
 if you buy a tripod 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.940
 40 quite as perfect, I am taking 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.940
 Ten grams pure 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 that's the whole thing 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:49.260
 then you do it then you put it here 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.330
 on it again and we see two here 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.729
 arrows must be on each other 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:05:02.340
 and then you just turn it all over 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:06.930
 in turn sits like that and then we have 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:13.410
 here's the likes and that's about it 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:15.389
 im been mentioning the mausrad is 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:23.430
 a four-way mausrad and became common 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:25.979
 renewed that is pretty quiet doll 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 from me had the roccat kone + and there 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.190
 that was pretty loud just like that 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:35.810
 at the coba that was also very loud and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.810
 I have to say that I like it already 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.090
 such a pc connects because I like the whole 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.439
 At first there may not be one 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.419
 independent video to follow 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:51.699
 and I would say 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:57.340
 Let's start, let's move on 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:06:06.090
 with this one on court this is 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:10.779
 the mouse pad is so flexible here 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:14.889
 i also had the aluminum that is 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:17.139
 I believe in the hand and I have myself 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.939
 now decided for the first because 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:23.379
 I personally found that feels 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:25.000
 better to ewald on the side and 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:30.539
 behind everything is not back to her 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.129
 and her slips as medimax do it 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:37.659
 is in any case was well received even the 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:41.279
 moving very much feels everyone else 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.279
 everything is better 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:50.830
 and then come to the quick intelligence 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:56.009
 guide then have the most unnecessary last then 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:58.839
 we also managed to do it here so often 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:06.669
 look if there is something in it apparently 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:09.520
 not this card does not shine anymore 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.990
 not so hiermann the whole yes above 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.170
 Everything could be labeled now 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.670
 to see bad but should be enough 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.950
 then we have only pre-made thing 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:32.320
 for theory for multimedia counterstrike 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:35.020
 and who are the only Control Elements 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.400
 we finished all this here too i hope 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:42.100
 like to get involved and I will 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.190
 Test the whole here and then you see 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.530
 sometimes just one week I think sometimes 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.790
 the iks cd with lighting but first 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.270
 I want my own opinion of it 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.760
 form 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.760
 everything that we see us
