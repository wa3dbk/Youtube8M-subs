hi<00:00:01.530> there<00:00:01.740> everyone<00:00:02.129> I've<00:00:02.850> been<00:00:03.210> trying<00:00:03.720> of

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi there everyone I've been trying of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.720 
hi there everyone I've been trying of
like<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.770> find<00:00:05.460> tutorials<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:07.099> dust<00:00:08.099> clouds

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
like to find tutorials on dust clouds

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.390 
like to find tutorials on dust clouds
that<00:00:12.230> basically<00:00:13.230> come<00:00:13.469> out<00:00:13.679> from<00:00:13.920> objects

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
that basically come out from objects

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.829 
that basically come out from objects
that<00:00:14.490> are<00:00:14.610> being<00:00:14.759> dropped<00:00:15.150> heavy<00:00:15.420> objects

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
that are being dropped heavy objects

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.460 
that are being dropped heavy objects
have<00:00:16.049> been<00:00:16.080> dropped<00:00:16.470> onto<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.920> ground<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
have been dropped onto the ground and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.099 
have been dropped onto the ground and
doesn't<00:00:19.470> seem<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:20.060> anything<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.600> on

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
doesn't seem to be anything really on

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
doesn't seem to be anything really on
the<00:00:22.980> internet<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> thought<00:00:24.150> I'd<00:00:24.269> put<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the internet so I thought I'd put a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
the internet so I thought I'd put a
quick<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.019> together<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> today<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
quick one together for you today and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.120 
quick one together for you today and
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.560> effect<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.650> we're<00:00:28.949> basically

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this is the effect that we're basically

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
this is the effect that we're basically
looking<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:31.700> very<00:00:32.700> very<00:00:33.000> quick<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.140> can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
looking at very very quick so you can

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
looking at very very quick so you can
see<00:00:34.410> particles<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.460> soon<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> hits<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
see particles as soon as it hits the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.250 
see particles as soon as it hits the
ground<00:00:36.149> particles<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:38.899> really<00:00:39.899> jump<00:00:40.140> off

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
ground particles just really jump off

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.090 
ground particles just really jump off
the<00:00:40.410> ground

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the ground

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.389 
the ground
rise<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:41.940> move<00:00:42.930> away<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
rise up and then move away from the the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
rise up and then move away from the the
object<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.910> disappear<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> I'll<00:00:46.680> show<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
object and disappear so I'll show you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
object and disappear so I'll show you
the<00:00:47.190> setup<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:50.059> we've<00:00:51.059> got<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the setup that I've got here we've got a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
the setup that I've got here we've got a
ground<00:00:51.750> plane<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> set<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> ground

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
ground plane so you set up a ground

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680 
ground plane so you set up a ground
plane<00:00:54.500> I've<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.280> cube<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> course<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
plane I've got the cube of course that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
plane I've got the cube of course that
all<00:00:57.989> I've<00:00:58.350> done<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.980> we'll<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.699> move<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
all I've done is we'll just move out a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.830 
all I've done is we'll just move out a
wee<00:01:00.329> bit<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.789> maybe<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
wee bit so you can see maybe go to the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
wee bit so you can see maybe go to the
front<00:01:04.500> view<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.439> simply<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.369> hits

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
front view so that that simply just hits

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.520 
front view so that that simply just hits
the<00:01:08.909> ground<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.159> where<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.580> hits<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.090> ground

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the ground and where it hits the ground

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
the ground and where it hits the ground
you've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.760> frame

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you've got to set up on that frame

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
you've got to set up on that frame
you've<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> set<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.759> particle

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you've got to set up your particle

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.340 
you've got to set up your particle
system<00:01:20.689> explosion<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> mission<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:24.350> we'll

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
system explosion or a mission so we'll

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.399 
system explosion or a mission so we'll
go<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.740> again<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.580> I'll<00:01:27.479> show<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.110> did

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
go in again and I'll show you how I did

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
go in again and I'll show you how I did
that<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:30.320> wireframe<00:01:32.180> I've<00:01:33.180> done<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that if we go into wireframe I've done I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.340 
that if we go into wireframe I've done I
put<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:35.270> another<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.630> plane<00:01:36.960> in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
put a little another little plane in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550 
put a little another little plane in
here<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.229> I've

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
here and you can see that I've

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.160 
here and you can see that I've
subdivided<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> few<00:01:41.610> times<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.960> give

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
subdivided a few times just to just give

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.980 
subdivided a few times just to just give
it<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> few<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.860> particles<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> shoot<00:01:45.720> off<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it a few more particles to shoot off the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
it a few more particles to shoot off the
faces<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.899> then<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.500> done<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
faces and then what I've also done is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.740 
faces and then what I've also done is
that<00:01:50.939> you'll<00:01:51.119> notice<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.869> travels<00:01:52.409> with

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
that you'll notice that it travels with

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.940 
that you'll notice that it travels with
the<00:01:55.909> thing<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.380> impacting<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the thing that it's impacting with and I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.830 
the thing that it's impacting with and I
just<00:01:59.219> find<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.969> Weaver<00:02:00.299> easier<00:02:00.719> if

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
just find that's a Weaver easier if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.560 
just find that's a Weaver easier if
you've<00:02:00.960> got<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> whole<00:02:01.469> lot<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.799> objects

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
you've got a whole lot of objects

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.230 
you've got a whole lot of objects
dropping<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.500> they've<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.799> got<00:02:04.829> their<00:02:05.159> own

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
dropping and they've all got their own

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.180 
dropping and they've all got their own
particle<00:02:06.240> systems<00:02:06.689> it's<00:02:06.840> much<00:02:07.079> easier<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.799> find

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
particle systems it's much easier I find

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.059 
particle systems it's much easier I find
to<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:09.060> link<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.509> together<00:02:09.890> rather<00:02:10.890> than

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
to to link them together rather than

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.150 
to to link them together rather than
have<00:02:11.400> them

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
have them

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.580 
have them
scattered<00:02:12.550> all<00:02:12.700> over<00:02:12.730> your<00:02:13.540> plane<00:02:13.960> area<00:02:14.410> or

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
scattered all over your plane area or

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.830 
scattered all over your plane area or
have<00:02:14.830> even<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.640> vertex<00:02:16.060> maps<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.510> your<00:02:16.660> plane

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
have even have vertex maps on your plane

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.400 
have even have vertex maps on your plane
area<00:02:18.360> excuse<00:02:19.360> me

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
area excuse me

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.190 
area excuse me
so<00:02:20.830> I've<00:02:20.920> animated<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.610> basically<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.660> come

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
so I've animated that basically to come

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.680 
so I've animated that basically to come
down<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.940> I'll<00:02:25.300> show<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.570> come<00:02:25.960> down<00:02:26.200> with

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
I've the very next frame so it's hiding

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080 
I've the very next frame so it's hiding

under the cubes very next frame I've

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.140 
under the cubes very next frame I've
expanded<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.410> just<00:02:47.530> sitting<00:02:48.160> beyond

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
expanded it so it's just sitting beyond

put<00:04:54.050> them<00:04:54.199> out<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.949> field<00:04:55.129> of<00:04:55.310> view<00:04:55.400> of

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
put them out of the the field of view of

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.140 
put them out of the the field of view of
the<00:04:55.580> camera<00:04:56.319> basically<00:04:57.319> a<00:04:57.650> cube<00:04:58.129> and<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.909> sphere

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
the camera basically a cube and a sphere

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.179 
the camera basically a cube and a sphere
that<00:04:59.750> I've<00:04:59.840> pulled<00:05:00.139> out<00:05:00.319> of<00:05:00.500> shape<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:00.800> they're

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
that I've pulled out of shape so they're

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.969 
that I've pulled out of shape so they're
not<00:05:01.460> too<00:05:01.699> uniform<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.629> then<00:05:03.169> selected<00:05:03.770> both

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
not too uniform and then selected both

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.450 
not too uniform and then selected both
of<00:05:04.250> them<00:05:04.430> gone<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.389> object<00:05:05.990> group<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.189> create

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
of them gone to object group and create

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.050 
of them gone to object group and create
new<00:05:07.909> group<00:05:08.439> it's<00:05:09.439> all<00:05:09.740> there<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.819> that

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
new group it's all there is to to that

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.040 
new group it's all there is to to that
and<00:05:11.360> so<00:05:12.050> if<00:05:12.379> I<00:05:12.590> was<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.009> select<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:14.300> again<00:05:14.719> I

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
and so if I was to select that again I

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.879 
and so if I was to select that again I
click<00:05:15.590> on<00:05:15.770> group<00:05:16.069> and<00:05:16.599> these<00:05:17.599> two<00:05:17.960> are<00:05:18.259> called

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
click on group and these two are called

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.179 
click on group and these two are called
group<00:05:20.889> very<00:05:21.889> creative<00:05:22.370> name<00:05:22.400> I<00:05:22.819> know<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:25.039> can

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
group very creative name I know you can

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.829 
group very creative name I know you can
also<00:05:25.340> have<00:05:25.699> children<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.949> will<00:05:28.219> greatly

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
also have children but this will greatly

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.180 
also have children but this will greatly
increase<00:05:29.839> your<00:05:29.870> render<00:05:30.529> time<00:05:30.770> because

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
increase your render time because

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.399 
increase your render time because
obviously<00:05:31.370> there's<00:05:31.879> more<00:05:32.110> particles<00:05:33.110> in<00:05:33.289> the

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
obviously there's more particles in the

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.369 
obviously there's more particles in the
scene<00:05:34.180> but<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.360> could<00:05:35.629> be<00:05:35.810> quite<00:05:35.960> cool<00:05:36.319> in

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
scene but it could be quite cool in

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.550 
scene but it could be quite cool in
terms<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:37.129> just<00:05:37.400> dust<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.240> bits<00:05:38.659> of<00:05:38.839> bits<00:05:39.379> of

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
terms of just dust and bits of bits of

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.320 
terms of just dust and bits of bits of
rock<00:05:39.860> or<00:05:40.069> whatever<00:05:40.839> flying<00:05:41.839> out<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:44.210> other

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
rock or whatever flying out the other

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.110 
rock or whatever flying out the other
thing<00:05:44.599> that<00:05:44.629> we<00:05:44.810> need<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.020> do<00:05:45.409> is<00:05:45.800> to<00:05:46.460> create<00:05:47.089> a

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
thing that we need to do is to create a

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.149 
thing that we need to do is to create a
material<00:05:50.120> which<00:05:50.900> I've<00:05:51.169> done<00:05:51.409> here<00:05:51.469> it's

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
material which I've done here it's

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:58.059 
material which I've done here it's
simply<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:55.099> standards<00:05:56.620> default<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.770> comes

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
simply the standards default that comes

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.490 
simply the standards default that comes
up<00:05:58.370> with<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:58.729> doc<00:05:58.939> views<00:05:59.300> I've<00:05:59.750> switched<00:06:00.229> off

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
up with the doc views I've switched off

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.170 
up with the doc views I've switched off
specularity<00:06:01.069> because<00:06:01.610> we<00:06:01.759> don't<00:06:01.969> want

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
specularity because we don't want

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.579 
specularity because we don't want
highlights<00:06:03.250> in<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.460> in<00:06:04.759> the<00:06:05.169> dust<00:06:06.789> particle

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
highlights in the in the dust particle

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.990 
highlights in the in the dust particle
transparency<00:06:09.589> obviously<00:06:10.189> dust<00:06:10.460> is<00:06:10.699> slightly

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
transparency obviously dust is slightly

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.749 
transparency obviously dust is slightly
transparent<00:06:11.560> so<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.589> said<00:06:12.889> that<00:06:13.039> to<00:06:13.189> raytrace

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
transparent so I said that to raytrace

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.540 
transparent so I said that to raytrace
0.5<00:06:14.569> alpha<00:06:15.729> with<00:06:16.729> no<00:06:17.569> specular<00:06:18.199> and<00:06:18.469> for<00:06:19.460> an

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
0.5 alpha with no specular and for an

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.959 
0.5 alpha with no specular and for an
owl<00:06:19.669> of<00:06:19.909> 0.3<00:06:20.659> and<00:06:20.990> a<00:06:21.650> bit<00:06:21.800> of<00:06:21.919> a<00:06:22.009> blend<00:06:22.250> of<00:06:22.430> 0.3

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
owl of 0.3 and a bit of a blend of 0.3

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:30.809 
owl of 0.3 and a bit of a blend of 0.3
5.5<00:06:24.729> and<00:06:25.729> then<00:06:26.479> if<00:06:26.750> we<00:06:26.900> go<00:06:27.139> back<00:06:27.439> to<00:06:28.449> our

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
5.5 and then if we go back to our

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.030 
5.5 and then if we go back to our
particles<00:06:31.819> tab

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
particles tab

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.220 
particles tab
you<00:06:33.610> can<00:06:33.820> see<00:06:34.210> in<00:06:34.630> here<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.530> render<00:06:36.040> it<00:06:37.230> tells

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
you can see in here the render it tells

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.610 
you can see in here the render it tells
you<00:06:38.500> what<00:06:38.950> material<00:06:39.670> mines<00:06:40.270> material<00:06:40.870> Oh<00:06:41.020> -<00:06:41.080> so

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
you what material mines material Oh - so

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.250 
you what material mines material Oh - so
material<00:06:42.160> -<00:06:42.370> is<00:06:42.550> what<00:06:42.730> it's<00:06:42.880> set<00:06:43.090> to<00:06:43.120> now<00:06:43.990> it's

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
material - is what it's set to now it's

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.100 
material - is what it's set to now it's
not<00:06:44.440> applied<00:06:44.890> to<00:06:44.920> the<00:06:45.280> particle<00:06:46.240> system<00:06:46.570> it<00:06:46.930> is

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
not applied to the particle system it is

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.330 
not applied to the particle system it is
actually<00:06:47.560> applied<00:06:47.920> to<00:06:48.670> these<00:06:48.940> two<00:06:50.340> objects

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
actually applied to these two objects

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.000 
actually applied to these two objects
here<00:06:51.640> so<00:06:52.030> you<00:06:52.090> will<00:06:52.300> see<00:06:52.600> when<00:06:53.500> I<00:06:53.530> click<00:06:53.860> on

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
here so you will see when I click on

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.580 
here so you will see when I click on
them<00:06:54.220> and<00:06:54.340> collect<00:06:54.760> the<00:06:54.880> material<00:06:55.590> it's

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
them and collect the material it's

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.470 
them and collect the material it's
actually<00:06:56.890> applied<00:06:57.430> to<00:06:57.460> these<00:06:57.760> two<00:06:58.120> and<00:06:58.360> then

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
actually applied to these two and then

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.810 
actually applied to these two and then
these<00:06:58.750> two<00:06:59.110> are<00:06:59.140> applied<00:06:59.770> to<00:07:00.070> the<00:07:00.490> particle

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
these two are applied to the particle

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.770 
these two are applied to the particle
system<00:07:02.040> so<00:07:03.040> that's<00:07:03.280> really<00:07:03.700> all<00:07:04.120> there<00:07:04.360> is<00:07:04.390> to

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
system so that's really all there is to

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.670 
system so that's really all there is to
it<00:07:04.930> oh<00:07:05.220> yes<00:07:06.220> one<00:07:06.520> last<00:07:06.550> thing<00:07:07.240> is<00:07:07.650> click<00:07:08.650> on

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 
it oh yes one last thing is click on

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.120 
it oh yes one last thing is click on
your<00:07:08.890> plane<00:07:09.520> and<00:07:09.970> click<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:11.020> physics<00:07:11.470> tab<00:07:11.800> and

your plane and click the physics tab and

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.890 
your plane and click the physics tab and
you<00:07:12.280> want<00:07:12.430> to<00:07:12.550> set<00:07:12.760> that<00:07:12.940> to<00:07:13.000> collision<00:07:13.750> in

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
you want to set that to collision in

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.820 
you want to set that to collision in
cases<00:07:14.890> any<00:07:15.130> sort<00:07:15.460> of<00:07:15.520> lingering<00:07:16.680> pieces<00:07:17.680> of

particle<00:07:31.420> system<00:07:31.810> and<00:07:31.960> then<00:07:32.560> they<00:07:32.740> won't

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:32.920 
particle system and then they won't

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.380 
particle system and then they won't
penetrate<00:07:33.250> through<00:07:33.640> the<00:07:33.670> floor<00:07:33.970> they'll<00:07:34.180> just

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390 
penetrate through the floor they'll just

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.630 
penetrate through the floor they'll just
bounce<00:07:34.690> and<00:07:34.990> slide<00:07:35.680> along<00:07:35.950> the<00:07:36.100> ground<00:07:36.310> and

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:36.640 
bounce and slide along the ground and

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.600 
bounce and slide along the ground and
then<00:07:37.150> you<00:07:37.270> I<00:07:37.540> haven't<00:07:37.900> changed<00:07:38.860> any<00:07:39.250> of<00:07:39.490> these

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
then you I haven't changed any of these

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.910 
then you I haven't changed any of these
settings<00:07:40.120> but<00:07:40.360> obviously<00:07:41.290> you<00:07:41.380> can<00:07:41.530> play<00:07:41.740> with

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:41.920 
settings but obviously you can play with

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.560 
settings but obviously you can play with
those<00:07:42.040> as<00:07:42.250> well<00:07:42.400> you<00:07:42.910> click<00:07:43.180> on<00:07:43.300> kill

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570 
those as well you click on kill

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.680 
those as well you click on kill
particles<00:07:44.110> as<00:07:44.290> soon<00:07:44.530> as<00:07:44.650> they<00:07:44.830> contact<00:07:45.690> the

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
particles as soon as they contact the

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.020 
particles as soon as they contact the
collision<00:07:47.290> plane<00:07:47.620> they<00:07:48.100> will<00:07:48.280> disappear<00:07:48.520> they

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.030 
collision plane they will disappear they

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.680 
collision plane they will disappear they
will<00:07:49.180> die<00:07:49.530> you've<00:07:50.530> got<00:07:50.710> soft<00:07:51.430> body<00:07:51.700> and<00:07:51.820> all

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.690 
will die you've got soft body and all

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.700 
will die you've got soft body and all
sorts<00:07:52.990> of<00:07:53.050> great<00:07:53.260> things<00:07:53.320> in<00:07:53.740> here<00:07:55.710> stickiness

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.710 
sorts of great things in here stickiness

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.580 
sorts of great things in here stickiness
and<00:07:57.160> things<00:07:57.550> too<00:07:57.820> to<00:07:58.600> mess<00:07:58.750> around<00:07:58.900> with<00:07:59.170> and

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.590 
and things too to mess around with and

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.500 
and things too to mess around with and
that's<00:07:59.890> all<00:08:00.100> there<00:08:00.220> is<00:08:00.310> to<00:08:00.550> it<00:08:00.700> and<00:08:00.880> so<00:08:03.510> you

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.510 
that's all there is to it and so you

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.710 
that's all there is to it and so you
render<00:08:05.260> you<00:08:05.440> can<00:08:05.590> render<00:08:05.830> it<00:08:05.950> out<00:08:06.160> and<00:08:06.720> you

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 
render you can render it out and you

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.480 
render you can render it out and you
will<00:08:07.930> get<00:08:08.170> this<00:08:08.380> great<00:08:08.650> result<00:08:09.180> have<00:08:10.180> fun
