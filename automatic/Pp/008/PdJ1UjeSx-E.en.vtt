video<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.260> i<00:00:43.290> thought<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:43.920> an

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
video but i thought this would be an

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
video but i thought this would be an
interesting<00:00:44.629> file<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.960> edit<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.980> know<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:48.329> looks

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
interesting file to edit I know it looks

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
interesting file to edit I know it looks
like<00:00:48.750> she's<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.170> too<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.379> makeup<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
like she's got too much makeup on in a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
like she's got too much makeup on in a
shot<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.480> always<00:00:51.690> seem<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
shot like this which they always seem to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
shot like this which they always seem to
put<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.379> too<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.559> makeup<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.610> why

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

one<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.059> recommendations<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> comes

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
one of my recommendations when it comes

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.799 
one of my recommendations when it comes
to<00:00:55.379> photographing<00:00:56.160> models<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.940> easy<00:00:57.390> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to photographing models is go easy on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
to photographing models is go easy on
the<00:00:58.050> make<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> cakes<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.219> there

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the make up because it cakes on there

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
the make up because it cakes on there
and<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> gets<00:01:00.420> all<00:01:00.570> reflective<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.379> looks

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and it gets all reflective and it looks

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
and it gets all reflective and it looks
all<00:01:01.680> weird<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.579> ways<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> bring

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
all weird but there are ways to bring

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.450
