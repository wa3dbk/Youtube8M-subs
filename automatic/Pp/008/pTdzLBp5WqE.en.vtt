problematic well wait for volume if this
work<00:01:21.399> if<00:01:21.579> this<00:01:21.729> paraffin<00:01:22.119> were<00:01:22.329> in<00:01:22.509> solution

work if this paraffin were in solution
at<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.409> higher<00:01:23.560> temperature<00:01:23.969> then<00:01:24.969> we<00:01:25.119> would

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
at a higher temperature then we would

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.709 
at a higher temperature then we would
use<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:26.039> thousand<00:01:27.039> times<00:01:27.249> or<00:01:27.579> even<00:01:27.639> up<00:01:27.939> 10,000

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
use a thousand times or even up 10,000

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.260 
use a thousand times or even up 10,000
times<00:01:28.869> less<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:30.189> our<00:01:30.369> product<00:01:30.819> in<00:01:30.999> order<00:01:31.179> to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
times less of our product in order to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.819 
times less of our product in order to
keep<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.659> in<00:01:31.749> solution<00:01:32.200> from<00:01:32.289> crashing<00:01:32.740> out

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
keep it in solution from crashing out

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.870 
keep it in solution from crashing out
into<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.100> slit<00:01:33.249> my<00:01:33.429> favor

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.630 

so<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.390> doesn't<00:01:38.600> really<00:01:38.840> matter<00:01:39.340> how<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.399> add

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
so it doesn't really matter how we add

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.819 
so it doesn't really matter how we add
this<00:01:40.939> at<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.810> point<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.350> I'm<00:01:42.439> going<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.619> add

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
this at this point so I'm going to add

00:01:42.829 --> 00:02:07.310 
this at this point so I'm going to add
the<00:01:43.039> product<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:47.539> actual<00:01:47.899> crew

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.309 

see

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
see

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.550 
see
Group<00:02:10.009> pours<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.489> quite<00:02:11.030> easily

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
Group pours out quite easily

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.770 
Group pours out quite easily
and<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.220> what<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.880> agitation<00:02:14.510> right<00:02:14.660> now

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
and then what the agitation right now

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.809 
and then what the agitation right now
it's<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.050> require<00:02:15.200> agitation<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
it's going to require agitation which it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.850 
it's going to require agitation which it
would<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.450> field<00:02:17.690> as<00:02:17.840> well<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.650> order<00:02:18.739> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
would in the field as well in order to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.710 
would in the field as well in order to
get<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.190> sub<00:02:19.520> solidified<00:02:20.060> paraffin<00:02:20.540> into

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
get this sub solidified paraffin into

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.910 
get this sub solidified paraffin into
solution<00:02:22.330> okay<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.390> as<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.720> can<00:02:23.810> see<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.709> on

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
solution okay so as you can see here on

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.610 
solution okay so as you can see here on
this<00:02:25.099> spatula<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.620> solidified

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
this spatula we have the solidified

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.280 
this spatula we have the solidified
paraffin<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.700> let's<00:02:28.880> continue<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.360> agitate

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.610 

okay<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.349> here<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:37.160> are<00:02:37.900> about<00:02:38.900> 20<00:02:39.290> seconds

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
okay so here we are about 20 seconds

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.140 
okay so here we are about 20 seconds
later<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.069> see<00:02:40.220> significantly<00:02:40.880> smaller

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
later you can see significantly smaller

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.559 
later you can see significantly smaller
will<00:02:41.450> continue<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.870> serve<00:02:42.910> again<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.239> is<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
will continue to serve again this is the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.680 
will continue to serve again this is the
amount<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.959> product<00:02:45.350> that<00:02:45.440> you've<00:02:45.560> added<00:02:45.739> is

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
amount of product that you've added is

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
amount of product that you've added is
very<00:02:47.690> quickly<00:02:48.970> falsifying<00:02:50.920> paraffin

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
very quickly falsifying paraffin

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.309 
very quickly falsifying paraffin
it's<00:02:53.550> gone<00:02:54.410> 30<00:02:55.410> seconds

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
okay as you can see about 30 seconds
