00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.229
 today we eat stuffed roasted peppers 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.209
 for this recipe in which we mix 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.219
 meat and vegetables we will use to 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.860
 four people a kilo of minced meat 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.500
 half onion a little bit of salt 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.160
 preferably not refined pepper 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.220
 about 400 grams of tomato a glass of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.170
 white wine 2 large red peppers and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.090
 of course virgin olive oil 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.950
 extra 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 The first thing we will do is chop the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.630
 onion we will use a room for the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.530
 tomato sauce and another room for 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.530
 sauté the meat 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.580
 in a pan better than Teflon 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.130
 we will put over medium heat oil 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.500
 enough to cover the fund and 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.450
 when it is hot we will put the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 onion that we had previously chopped 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.800
 and we'll leave her home 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.500
 once the onion is sautéed 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 after two or three minutes 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 we will add the tomato let's make a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 tomato sauce or fried tomato this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.540
 tomato can be a canned 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 we have bought or a canned 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 do ourselves closing the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 empty the boats in the bain- marie we put 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.870
 a little bit of salt and a little bit of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 Pepper 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.010
 at the same time to take advantage of the time 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.230
 We will put in another pan over high heat 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.630
 enough oil to cover the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.300
 background and when the oil is hot 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.290
 we will put the other quarter of onion 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.290
 we had stung before 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.790
 We follow the same process once 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.830
 the onion is cooked after two 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.830
 or three minutes we add the meat 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.780
 on the other hand and after about 10 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 minutes the tomato will have done what 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.110
 we will have been moving from time to 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.110
 when to make us better 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.810
 we will have been moving the meat once 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.330
 in when to be done 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.090
 evenly after about 10 minutes 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.740
 the meat will always be cooked with the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630
 strong fire because we want to be 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.610
 I cooked and not that the meat is cooked 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.010
 with what approximately we will have 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.170
 made the tomato sauce and the meat 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 same time we put a little bit of 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.810
 salt a little pepper 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340
 and we add the glass of white wine 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.350
 while the wine alcohol evaporates 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 that we have added to the meat we are going to 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.310
 pass the tomato sauce for a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.760
 blender we will have let it cool down 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.769
 shortly before 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360
 once the alcohol has evaporated 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.099
 Wine that we will know because it does not smell 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.890
 to alcohol but he will have left all his 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.689
 We are going to add a couple of cases 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.180
 of the tomato sauce that is going to give 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.829
 very soft if after filling 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.599
 the peppers will have plenty of meat with 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.940
 Tomato can always be reused 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.480
 to make some macaroni with sauce 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.480
 bolognese 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.630
 now we go with the peppers les 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.820
 we remove the stem that we are going to 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.160
 book and all the nerves and all the 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.410
 pips that have peppers inside 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.540
 They provide us with vitamin C that protects us 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.390
 against infections as well 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
 vitamin e which is antioxidant and phosphorus 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.330
 that helps us to train our 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.330
 bones and our teeth 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.700
 Once the peppers clean 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.020
 fill with meat 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.330
 we all know that the pepper is 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.250
 originating from america and colon brought him to 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.200
 Spain on its first trip after 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.630
 discovery and presented it to the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.670
 Catholic kings his original name is 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.770
 agile and all its varieties were 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.170
 spicy that's why it was called 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.300
 pepper as a substitute for pepper 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.340
 from which the Venetian merchants 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.340
 they had the monopoly of commerce 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.990
 Once the peppers stuffed 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.150
 we cover again with the stem so that 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.220
 do not leave the meat in the oven and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.300
 we prick it with a toothpick so that 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.300
 stem is well attached 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.490
 in pre-Columbian cultures the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.470
 spicy pepper was used 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.900
 curiously to combat the heat 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.520
 now let's use the peppers and to 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.489
 we will have preheated the oven to 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.670
 180 degrees we put a little salt 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.400
 a little oil and a little bit of 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.970
 white wine and we will put the oven alone 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.970
 under 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.039
 after about 45 minutes and having them 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.500
 turned the peppers once 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.719
 we will have them ready and until the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.770
 next recipe if you liked
