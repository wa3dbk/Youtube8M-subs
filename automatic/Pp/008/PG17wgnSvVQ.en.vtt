00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
one note to remove this 13 millimeter

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.889 
one note to remove this 13 millimeter
bolt<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.030> need<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> hold<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:52.699> with<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.910> 8<00:00:54.440> no

bolt you need to hold it with an 8 no
let's<00:00:57.899> find<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.350> wrench<00:00:59.160> here<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
let's find a wrench here you need to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.480 
let's find a wrench here you need to
hold<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> 17<00:01:08.310> millimeter

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
hold this one with a 17 millimeter

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
hold this one with a 17 millimeter
wrench<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.570> pull<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.860> 13<00:01:11.250> millimeter

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
wrench as you pull out the 13 millimeter

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
wrench as you pull out the 13 millimeter
bolt<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.510> need<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> hold<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.320> from

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
bolt out you need to hold this one from

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
bolt out you need to hold this one from
spinning<00:01:15.049> problem<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:17.670> wrench<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
spinning problem is this wrench was a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.399 
spinning problem is this wrench was a
little<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.750> too<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.860> wide<00:01:20.780> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.140> tell

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
little bit too too wide if you can tell

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.130 
little bit too too wide if you can tell
it's<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.189> too<00:01:23.369> wide<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> sticks

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it's a little bit too wide and it sticks

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.480 
it's a little bit too wide and it sticks
out<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.900> have<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.470> half-ass<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
out so I have to kind of half-ass it and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.870 
out so I have to kind of half-ass it and
hold<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:31.290> 18<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.729> really

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
hold it on with my 18 but it really

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.789 
hold it on with my 18 but it really
should<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.390> narrow<00:01:34.110> thin<00:01:34.909> thin<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.180> way

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
should be a narrow thin thin this way

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.510 
should be a narrow thin thin this way
then<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:39.500> 17<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> should<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
then this way 17 it should really be to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
then this way 17 it should really be to
hold<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> take<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> caliper

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
hold it and then to take out the caliper

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.270 
hold it and then to take out the caliper
bracket

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.070 

take<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.580> caliper<00:01:51.120> bracket<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.520> an<00:01:53.670> 18

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.990 

there's<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:59.600> 1918<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:02.040> take<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> caliper

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
there's a 1918 to take out the caliper

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
there's a 1918 to take out the caliper
bracket<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> 13<00:02:05.460> over<00:02:05.760> here<00:02:06.170> 17<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> hold<00:02:07.530> us

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
bracket so 13 over here 17 to hold us

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.890 
bracket so 13 over here 17 to hold us
from<00:02:07.920> spinning<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.580> 18<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.150> take<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.480> caliper

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
from spinning and 18 to take the caliper

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.200 
from spinning and 18 to take the caliper
bracket<00:02:10.260> out<00:02:12.260> brake<00:02:13.260> bleeder<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.210> already

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
bracket out brake bleeder I already

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.540 
bracket out brake bleeder I already
checked<00:02:16.970> wherever<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:20.040> obvious<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
checked wherever it is it's obvious the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.050 
checked wherever it is it's obvious the
brake<00:02:20.730> bleeder<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> 9<00:02:21.420> millimeter<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:23.060> now

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
brake bleeder is a 9 millimeter and now

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.970 
brake bleeder is a 9 millimeter and now
we're<00:02:24.240> dealing<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.900> torques<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.590> has

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
we're dealing with the torques that has

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.480 
we're dealing with the torques that has
to<00:02:26.160> come<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:27.080> what<00:02:28.080> size<00:02:28.320> torts<00:02:28.710> I'll<00:02:29.130> check

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
to come out what size torts I'll check

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:57.330 
to come out what size torts I'll check
in<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.970> moment

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.500 

okay

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.809 

so<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.170> exact<00:03:01.560> fit<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.069> already<00:03:02.340> tried<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
so the exact fit I already tried the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.229 
so the exact fit I already tried the
bigger<00:03:03.030> size<00:03:03.360> out<00:03:03.629> didn't<00:03:03.959> work<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:05.150> what<00:03:06.150> do

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
bigger size out didn't work so what do

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:14.930 
bigger size out didn't work so what do
we<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.940> there's<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.900> t30<00:03:13.940> t30

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
we have here so there's a it's a t30 t30

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.259 
we have here so there's a it's a t30 t30
and<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:16.739> don't<00:03:16.890> want<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.190> screw<00:03:17.700> around<00:03:17.730> with

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
and you don't want to screw around with

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.940 
and you don't want to screw around with
a<00:03:19.200> regular<00:03:19.709> screwdrivers<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.739> want

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
a regular screwdrivers on this you want

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.759 
a regular screwdrivers on this you want
to<00:03:22.980> use<00:03:23.069> impact<00:03:23.629> whether<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.780> mechanical

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
to use impact whether a mechanical

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.280 
to use impact whether a mechanical
impact<00:03:26.329> adapter<00:03:27.329> where<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.840> hit<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.110> with<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
impact adapter where you hit it with a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.259 
impact adapter where you hit it with a
hammer<00:03:28.379> but<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:30.569> have<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.290> those<00:03:31.409> but<00:03:32.239> use<00:03:33.239> a

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
hammer but I have one of those but use a
