00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.840
 the match is we change it a 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.280
 rolling case we keep it 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.160
 we have not changed at the level 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 of the structure just the graph 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.010
 on the other hand a match and I was it is a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.810
 evolution of a match is still a bit 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 more rigid a little more pop a little 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 more stability at high speed for 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.859
 jigs that ride a little bit more 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.689
 loud what they wanted the board 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.320
 versatile freestyle with so much 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 camber in the middle such hybrid hybrid 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 swing like in the middle with wall 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 authors at the front and back 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.739
 to give a little more versatility 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 and flu with the corner so the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.960
 rainbow which holds slightly tendency to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.239
 look like dh 2 that pretty much the same 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.199
 the same core but just a difference 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.969
 of euros who have the dh 2 of the match and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.420
 I was a little bigger, we had a lot more 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.770
 versatile thanks civilian outfit for the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 peace was seen so I will test myself 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 the newcomer to the range what 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 machete I was in 58 wild 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.689
 So me it's the match is for me 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.950
 remains a safe bet I was great 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.600
 intrigue is attested to test this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 new box is so we feel in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.049
 snow contact it's a little bit more 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.009
 aggressive a little more incisive than the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.320
 match is classic but I know that the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 camber with rocker for me it remains 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 it remains the best compromise 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.590
 why because we get hooked 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.590
 it regains pop in and in fact it went 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.310
 account that when playability and in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.200
 tolerance 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.260
 we are very close to a body topple 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.260
 or a camber 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.720
 still higuain so so super great 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.390
 board it hangs well there is a link 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.790
 there is a big pop his raise well this is 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 tolerant and we pushed a little 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.410
 snow will be paul and it absorbs super 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 well ground because of the rocker and so 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.530
 that's okay it's really the board 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.030
 versatile to do everything cheap and 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.100
 freestyle but who played this pass 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.690
 everywhere and who at speed flinches no 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.880
 what more to say that join that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.830
 that there is no problem 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.470
 well here and this part shots 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.470
 heart this year on the test site
