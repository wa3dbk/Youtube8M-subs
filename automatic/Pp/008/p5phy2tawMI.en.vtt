00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.599
 hello and welcome again in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 this test 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.980
 but now my studio so 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
 today we are going to talk about my helmet to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.710
 leucate really with which I roll 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.210
 for several months the mojito helmet 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 that's what he likes a lot 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 aesthetically and then he is very 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.660
 comfortable we feel right away from 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 when we stand up on the head we feel that it is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 very different from what we tried 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.969
 in the past in terms of comfort then 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.579
 now what makes this comfort 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.500
 foremost on the mojito it's going to be the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.289
 point it is very light either to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.129
 fork out less light you will feel it on 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.910
 the head is 2 120 grams this helmet 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 and beyond that, what makes it so successful 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 in relation to its weight goes is that in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.910
 General a 220 g helmet 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.189
 we are at 200 euros or even more and there 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.170
 with the mojito we are below 150 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.170
 euros public 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.890
 the other important comfort element that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 is going to be the inner foams that are 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.530
 antibacterial washable machine is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 thick enough which you will have a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 feeling of curiosity constantly 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 when you wear the mojito other details 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.759
 I remember that the mojito helmet and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.869
 the whole range cast is made in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.189
 italy next to bergamo so here we go 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.619
 find a little class in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.740
 Italian skirt chin straps 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.509
 is leather so it's leather 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 synthetic marine qr which is the most 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.829
 high quality synthetic leather from 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 market and this quality of leather has for 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.340
 particularity of resisting the ground so this 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.119
 which can be useful in relation to the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.590
 perspiration and other elements 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.710
 terms of comfort obviously at the level 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.770
 of jugular you will see a better 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.450
 touch I want to say that nylon 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.619
 who when he's going to rub is definitely going 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 often cause irritation 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 when we were a little sensitive that's it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.879
 can ask some things 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.730
 problems 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.040
 so the leather strap is an element 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.709
 very important now the element the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.590
 more important on the helmet the mojito 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.739
 it is the occipital tightening system 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.610
 on two joints that will come down 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.280
 very low 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.900
 it is unique in castres while there 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 I deliberately exaggerate obviously you 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 never put it like that but the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.980
 most cases what we are going to tighten 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.569
 very high at this point we have to the bone 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.519
 occipital at the back of the skull 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.590
 it's not always nice 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.560
 often a pressure point at this level 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.319
 there I will ride on you Simon whole 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.209
 after you go serve him and a lot 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.970
 lower highest level of the neck and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.590
 spread the pressure over more width 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.840
 so you are going to need 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.099
 if you can the past if they go up 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.050
 are going to need to squeeze it a lot 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.840
 less than a traditional helmet for 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.409
 get a hold quite 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.750
 secure seeing if you can turn around 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.860
 here we see that you put it very low 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.959
 you used to put it in this 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.510
 position there there is no need for the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.250
 squeeze one is on a position where he 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.930
 already holds very well there is a good 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.150
 held there is no need to squeeze more 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 in general a helmet is used in the background 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.379
 there if I want to squeeze more I can 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.650
 to go but it's useless here it's going 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.970
 rather be unpleasant what would have 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.470
 been indispensable on another father this 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.450
 what is absolutely useless 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.769
 on the mojito that's when we arrive 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.580
 pressure is enough 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.310
 soon after things as interesting 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.840
 great comfort and we have a helmet that 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.570
 is really very very very compact 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.160
 really it is very very good 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.650
 the head it goes very very well and it 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.690
 it's another aesthetic and super point 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.850
 super interesting but here it is very 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.660
 compact very rounded with this break 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.360
 on the back good here it is that it is 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.630
 awesome and the other big big argument 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.370
 it is available on 18 colors 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.020
 different with a base of black and 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.380
 white base you are going to have some 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.910
 classic colors black black white 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.130
 red white red which are colors 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.790
 that we find very often and on 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.080
 bikes or on club outfits but 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.060
 you will be able to have more things 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.410

 blue fluo the same blue as the team 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.690
 sky and the sky kit that rolls obviously 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.040
 with a good part of the helmet range 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.360
 and of course with the mojito so here at 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.530

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 especially very comfortable with the mojito 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.870
 all this makes it the best seller helmet of
