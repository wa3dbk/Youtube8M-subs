Hi! My name is George Lebedev,

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.452
I'm the CEO of Giftery.ru.

00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.742
I'm going to tell you about a way to make your life easier

00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:11.967
and more pleasant.

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:13.519
My friend lives in St. Petersburg.

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:14.944
We're online friends

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:17.086
and this morning I've found out it is his birthday.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:19.701
I'd love to give him a real gift,

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:21.924
but a trip to St. Petes is a bit out of my way today.

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:24.852
I go to giftery.ru

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:27.725
and choose a brand to give.

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:28.968
Serge is into fashion,

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:32.498
so the choices available at "Kupi VIP" shopping club should work.

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:34.167
I choose a greeting card,

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:35.687
write a message,

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.382
set delivery time

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:43.330
and e-mail address to send the gift to: seryoga@glazkov.ru.

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:45.697
Our product is a virtual gift certificate.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:50.138
It is sent along with the greeting card as an e-mail message.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.035
The recipient can just show it at the cashier

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:54.979
or enter the number in the correspondent field while shopping online.

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:58.131
They can use the certificate whenever they like.

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.267
So, why are we great?

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.639
First, placing an order is easy.

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:04.320
Even with only a couple of minutes to spare,

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:05.940
you have enough time to give a gift.

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.363
Second, it's fast and distance doesn't matter.

00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:12.149
Your friend might be in any city in any country, even on a different continent

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:14.352
they'll still get your present in mere seconds. 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.013
And third, it is a chance to make a gift even more enjoyable:

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:20.458
they can choose it themselves.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.784
There are dozens of well-known brands in our catalog

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:24.774
and the list grows every week.

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:29.787
You can pay for the gift with a credit card, 

00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:33.105
WebMoney, Yandex.Money or Visa QIWI Wallet.

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.423
Foreign clients can also use PayPal.

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:40.352
For those who keep up with their friends on Odnoklassniki, Vkontakte or Facebook,

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:42.173
we've made suitable applications.

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:45.340
To give your friend a gift you don't have to know their e-mail address,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.133
you can just choose them from the list of your friends

00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:49.692
and they will get the notification.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.774
For those on the move we've made mobile applications.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:58.227
You can access all functions of Giftery with your iPhone or Android smartphone.

00:01:58.513 --> 00:01:59.536
That's it, I've got to go.

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.961
My colleague, the one I did congratulate in time,

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.558
is inviting everyone to her Birthday party.

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:05.534
Remember: gift giving is easy.
