higher so he's got really about three
different<00:01:29.770> choices<00:01:30.190> there<00:01:30.730> if<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.060> was<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.860> set

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
different choices there if I was to set

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.250 
different choices there if I was to set
its<00:01:33.040> router<00:01:33.280> hike<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.970> there<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:35.140> was

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
its router hike on there so that was

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.440 
its router hike on there so that was
just<00:01:35.409> one<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.920> one<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.000> extra<00:01:37.270> little

features I did for him so anyway I got

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.320 
features I did for him so anyway I got
my<00:01:40.150> prints<00:01:40.600> out<00:01:40.750> here<00:01:41.020> they're<00:01:41.320> gonna<00:01:41.920> cut<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.760 
my prints out here they're gonna cut the
aluminum<00:01:43.330> angle<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.100> z-axis<00:01:45.100> rails<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
aluminum angle for the z-axis rails and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.260 
aluminum angle for the z-axis rails and
I'll<00:01:47.770> maybe<00:01:48.010> fire<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.430> camera<00:01:48.729> back<00:01:48.909> up<00:01:49.120> when

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
I'll maybe fire you camera back up when

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
okay got both the z-axis angles cat and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.610 
okay got both the z-axis angles cat and
I<00:02:20.240> probably<00:02:20.450> mentioned<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.960> before<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:21.560> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
I probably mentioned this before one of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.130 
I probably mentioned this before one of
the<00:02:21.680> other<00:02:21.800> videos<00:02:22.660> but<00:02:23.660> I'll<00:02:23.810> go<00:02:23.900> ahead<00:02:23.960> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the other videos but I'll go ahead and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
the other videos but I'll go ahead and
take<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.590> yeah<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.060> cut<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.420> real<00:02:26.660> easy

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
take in yeah you can cut this real easy

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.860 
take in yeah you can cut this real easy
with<00:02:27.200> your<00:02:27.920> miter<00:02:28.160> saw<00:02:28.430> if<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.670> have<00:02:28.850> one<00:02:29.120> if

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
with your miter saw if you have one if

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.480 
with your miter saw if you have one if
you<00:02:30.050> got<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> carbide<00:02:30.620> tip<00:02:30.770> plate<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.370> there

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
you got a carbide tip plate on there

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.800 
you got a carbide tip plate on there
which<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.820> think<00:02:31.850> most<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.360> them<00:02:32.450> are<00:02:32.600> these

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
which I think most of them are these

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
which I think most of them are these
days<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:34.130> we'll<00:02:34.250> go<00:02:34.370> through<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:34.700> soft

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
days and we'll go through this soft

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.490 
days and we'll go through this soft
aluminum<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.690> easy<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.320> nice

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
aluminum really easy and you get a nice

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.370 
aluminum really easy and you get a nice
nice<00:02:37.370> work<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.360> it'll<00:02:38.540> make<00:02:38.690> leave<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
nice work and it'll make leave just a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.470 
nice work and it'll make leave just a
little<00:02:39.590> bit<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.610> know<00:02:40.640> slight<00:02:41.000> bird<00:02:41.270> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
little bit of a you know slight bird you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.130 
little bit of a you know slight bird you
just<00:02:41.630> take<00:02:41.920> little<00:02:42.920> file<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.690> file<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.959> off

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
just take little file here file that off

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.560 
just take little file here file that off
and<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:45.560> nice<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.070> smooth<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:46.550> no<00:02:47.090> problem

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
and it's nice and smooth so no problem

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.930 
and it's nice and smooth so no problem
another<00:02:48.260> thing<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.620> want<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.950> point<00:02:49.610> out<00:02:49.820> about

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
another thing I want to point out about

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.730 
another thing I want to point out about
these<00:02:50.240> angles<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.930> got<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.140> remember<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
these angles is you got to remember and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.020 
these angles is you got to remember and
again<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> think<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.400> mentioned<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:52.850> in<00:02:53.000> my

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
again I think I mentioned this in my

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.870 
again I think I mentioned this in my
other<00:02:53.300> video<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.500> you're<00:02:54.590> putting

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
other video but what you're putting

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.400 
other video but what you're putting
drilling<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.940> holes<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.300> these<00:02:56.420> angles<00:02:56.840> you

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
drilling the holes for these angles you

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.230 
drilling the holes for these angles you
got<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.620> make<00:02:57.740> sure<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.070> do<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.459> one<00:02:58.700> way<00:02:58.880> and

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
got to make sure to do a one one way and

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.880 
got to make sure to do a one one way and
then<00:02:59.390> one<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.750> opposite<00:03:00.230> because<00:03:00.440> there<00:03:00.740> are

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
then one the opposite because there are

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.050 
then one the opposite because there are
a<00:03:00.920> Writing<00:03:01.520> Lab<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.090> make<00:03:02.870> sure<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.170> don't

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
a Writing Lab so make sure you don't

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.460 
a Writing Lab so make sure you don't
know<00:03:05.060> set<00:03:05.420> up<00:03:05.450> your<00:03:05.690> drill<00:03:05.870> press<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.140> drill

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
know set up your drill press and drill

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.660 
know set up your drill press and drill
above<00:03:06.680> them<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.040> have<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.340> both<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.640> same

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
above them and have them both the same

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.050 
above them and have them both the same
way<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.989> won't<00:03:09.200> work<00:03:10.030> okay<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.450> managed<00:03:12.080> to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
way that won't work okay I managed to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.670 
way that won't work okay I managed to
beat<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.090> rails<00:03:14.420> put<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> z-axis<00:03:15.200> here

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
beat the rails put on the z-axis here

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.550 
beat the rails put on the z-axis here
got<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.459> other<00:03:16.940> mount<00:03:17.269> or<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> router<00:03:18.080> Matic

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
got the other mount or a router Matic

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.670 
got the other mount or a router Matic
should<00:03:18.830> say<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.910> here<00:03:20.360> get<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:21.430> bearing<00:03:22.430> now

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.580 

all<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.550> ready<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.910> go<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.690> guess<00:03:29.230> probably

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
all this ready to go so I guess probably

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.910 
all this ready to go so I guess probably
the<00:03:29.800> next<00:03:30.100> step<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.500> trip<00:03:32.770> to

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the next step is they get a trip to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.860 
the next step is they get a trip to
Lowe's<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.430> gets<00:03:33.640> them<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.000> before<00:03:34.390> us<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.690> make

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
Lowe's it gets them to before us to make

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.680 
Lowe's it gets them to before us to make
the<00:03:35.050> frame<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.620> go<00:03:35.770> ahead<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.570> start<00:03:37.570> making

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the frame and go ahead and start making

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.930 
the frame and go ahead and start making
the<00:03:37.900> crank<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.650> was<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.220> spent<00:03:39.730> all<00:03:39.820> I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the crank for this was that spent all I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.790 
the crank for this was that spent all I
lack<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.480> need<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.870> cut<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.080> few<00:03:41.320> other<00:03:41.500> little

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
lack I need to cut a few other little

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:52.590 
lack I need to cut a few other little
parts<00:03:42.810> some<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.960> y<00:03:44.140> axis<00:03:48.180> Y<00:03:49.180> axis<00:03:51.600> nothing

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
parts some of the y axis Y axis nothing

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.270 
parts some of the y axis Y axis nothing
I<00:03:52.690> might<00:03:52.870> miss<00:03:53.020> you<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:53.350> is<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.980> with

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
I might miss you do is I think it with

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.040 
I might miss you do is I think it with
the<00:03:54.430> first<00:03:54.700> video<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.450> was<00:03:55.690> talking<00:03:55.990> about

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
the first video I was talking about

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.620 
the first video I was talking about
maybe<00:03:56.560> this<00:03:56.800> roughly<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.790> size<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.270> my<00:03:58.450> other

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
maybe this roughly the size of my other

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.300 
maybe this roughly the size of my other
machine<00:03:58.780> which<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.380> behind<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.770> camera<00:04:00.130> there

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
machine which is behind the camera there

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.960 
machine which is behind the camera there
about<00:04:00.580> 40<00:04:01.420> inches<00:04:01.570> wide<00:04:01.750> by<00:04:02.320> 26<00:04:02.890> inch<00:04:03.430> worth<00:04:03.850> of

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
about 40 inches wide by 26 inch worth of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.380 
about 40 inches wide by 26 inch worth of
cutting<00:04:04.300> area<00:04:04.630> but<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:06.580> know<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.700> got<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.090> bought

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
cutting area but you know I got I bought

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.850 
cutting area but you know I got I bought
two<00:04:07.770> eight-foot<00:04:08.790> angles<00:04:10.110> which<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.650> know<00:04:11.740> by

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
two eight-foot angles which you know by

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.110 
two eight-foot angles which you know by
the<00:04:11.950> time<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.160> cut<00:04:12.430> them<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.610> half<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.820> get

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
the time you cut them in half you get

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.670 
the time you cut them in half you get
four-foot<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:13.990> called<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.530> there

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
four-foot so I called you in there

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.380 
four-foot so I called you in there
that's<00:04:14.950> hey<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.280> know<00:04:15.520> might<00:04:16.060> as<00:04:16.090> well<00:04:16.180> make
