00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
excited about it and this gameplay isn't
from<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.590> unfortunately<00:00:29.250> i<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.029> had

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
from that unfortunately i have not had

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.569 
from that unfortunately i have not had
an<00:00:30.300> opportunity<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.869> test<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:32.520> know

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
an opportunity to test it but you know

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.450 
an opportunity to test it but you know
this<00:00:32.820> leads<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.329> an<00:00:33.480> interesting<00:00:33.690> thought

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
this leads me to an interesting thought

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.720 
this leads me to an interesting thought
on<00:00:35.570> how<00:00:36.800> Treyarch<00:00:37.800> has<00:00:37.890> approached<00:00:38.340> call<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
on how Treyarch has approached call of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
on how Treyarch has approached call of
duty<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.360> seems<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:41.010> legitly

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
duty like it seems like they legitly

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.650 
duty like it seems like they legitly
have<00:00:42.000> listened<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> community<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.510> lot

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
have listened to the community and a lot

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
have listened to the community and a lot
of<00:00:45.719> people<00:00:45.870> give<00:00:46.140> track<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> bad<00:00:46.710> rap<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> mean<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of people give track a bad rap I mean I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540 
of people give track a bad rap I mean I
don't<00:00:48.050> black<00:00:49.050> ops<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> balanced<00:00:50.039> game<00:00:50.250> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
don't black ops is a balanced game I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
don't black ops is a balanced game I
think<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.570> things<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
think that it has some things where it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
think that it has some things where it
gets<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.550> frustrating<00:00:53.940> even<00:00:54.570> more<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
gets really frustrating even more so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
gets really frustrating even more so
than<00:00:55.170> modern<00:00:55.469> warfare<00:00:55.620> 2<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.399> that's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
than modern warfare 2 and I think that's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
than modern warfare 2 and I think that's
just<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.270> played<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.020> much<00:00:58.170> we

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
just because we played it so much we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
just because we played it so much we
played<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:58.890> call<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> duty<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> past

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
played so much call of duty in the past

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.840 
played so much call of duty in the past

on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> next<00:01:20.460> title<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.630> we're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
on the next title I think we're going to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
on the next title I think we're going to
be<00:01:22.080> pretty<00:01:22.320> satisfied<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
be pretty satisfied with what we have to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.570 
be pretty satisfied with what we have to
see<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.720> support<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.409> black<00:01:26.009> ops<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
see I think support and black ops is the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
see I think support and black ops is the
only<00:01:26.759> thing<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> has<00:01:27.390> kept<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:27.869> playing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
only thing that has kept people playing

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
only thing that has kept people playing
it<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.520> nice<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.060> they

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
it and it's nice to see that they

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690

they've<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:30.900> listened<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.460> haven't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
like i said this back in like I think it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.580 
like i said this back in like I think it
was<00:01:40.860> either<00:01:40.979> December<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.110> cod<00:01:43.320> 4

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
was either December and so in a cod 4

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.039 
was either December and so in a cod 4
gameplay<00:01:44.180> actually<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.360> cod<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.810> live

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
gameplay actually is my cod for live

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
gameplay actually is my cod for live
commentary<00:01:46.530> i<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.680> talking<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.220> how<00:01:47.790> they

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
commentary i was talking about how they

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.600 
commentary i was talking about how they
should<00:01:48.540> create<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> fast-paced<00:01:50.100> playlist

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
should create like a fast-paced playlist

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.920 
should create like a fast-paced playlist
where<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:50.970> rid<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> ghosts<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.570> second

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
where they got rid of ghosts and second

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
where they got rid of ghosts and second
chance<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> maybe<00:01:52.560> made<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> there

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
chance and maybe made it so that there

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.340 
chance and maybe made it so that there
were<00:01:54.060> things<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> slow<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> game<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
if I play a knife him again and that was

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.140 
if I play a knife him again and that was
a<00:02:49.200> poor<00:02:49.950> showing<00:02:50.160> his<00:02:50.400> skill<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.970> guys

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a poor showing his skill on that guys

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
a poor showing his skill on that guys
but<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.600> know<00:02:51.690> what<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.140> heck<00:02:52.290> he<00:02:52.440> was

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
but I don't know what the heck he was

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.500 
but I don't know what the heck he was
thinking<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.610> he<00:02:53.730> was<00:02:53.880> back<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> topic

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
thinking but he was back to the topic

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.330 
thinking but he was back to the topic
these<00:02:55.140> games<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.530> take<00:02:55.740> forever<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.310> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
these games just take forever and I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.010 
these games just take forever and I
think<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.700> black<00:02:57.150> ops<00:02:57.390> who<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.660> really

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
think it black ops who will really

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.190 
think it black ops who will really
benefit<00:02:58.410> from<00:02:58.470> having<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.960> because<00:03:00.960> she<00:03:01.080> could

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
benefit from having a because she could

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.230 
benefit from having a because she could
say<00:03:01.410> fast<00:03:01.740> paced<00:03:01.980> playlist<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.030> think

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
say fast paced playlist and I think

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120 
say fast paced playlist and I think
basically<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.140> arise<00:03:04.530> from<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.980> is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
basically what will arise from that is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.100 
basically what will arise from that is
it'll<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.210> know<00:03:06.240> these<00:03:06.450> updates<00:03:06.900> keep

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
it'll you know these updates keep

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
it'll you know these updates keep
breathing<00:03:07.560> new<00:03:07.740> life<00:03:07.770> in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.310> black<00:03:08.550> ops<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
breathing new life in the black ops it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.550 
breathing new life in the black ops it
keeps<00:03:09.090> giving<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.540> given<00:03:09.870> us<00:03:09.960> something<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.410> do

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
keeps giving it given us something to do

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.500 
keeps giving it given us something to do
like<00:03:10.740> every<00:03:10.980> time<00:03:11.100> we<00:03:11.250> all<00:03:11.400> quit<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:12.240> all<00:03:12.360> keep

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
like every time we all quit we all keep

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.530 
really keep the game fresh I think that
the<00:03:38.100> way<00:03:38.280> they've<00:03:38.490> supported<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.060> game<00:03:39.240> keeps

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540

it fresh I guess you know the DLC it can
be<00:03:42.390> responsible<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.110> lot<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.530> fresh

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
be responsible for a lot of the fresh

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.610 
be responsible for a lot of the fresh
take<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.120> black<00:03:45.990> ops<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:46.500> in

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
take that you have on black ops but in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.750 
take that you have on black ops but in
the<00:03:46.710> same<00:03:46.890> respect<00:03:48.170> DLC<00:03:49.170> has<00:03:49.650> gotten<00:03:50.010> old<00:03:50.070> to

the same respect DLC has gotten old to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.730 
the same respect DLC has gotten old to
the<00:03:50.880> point<00:03:51.090> where<00:03:51.360> if<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:52.170> were<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.560> release

the point where if they were to release

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.920 
the point where if they were to release
another<00:03:53.100> map<00:03:53.550> pack<00:03:53.850> I'm<00:03:54.090> not<00:03:54.270> so<00:03:54.510> sure<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.750> I

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
another map pack I'm not so sure that I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.560 
another map pack I'm not so sure that I
would<00:03:55.050> have<00:03:55.290> bought<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.880> that's<00:03:56.880> because<00:03:57.360> I've

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
would have bought it that's because I've

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.090 
would have bought it that's because I've
had<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.380> enough<00:03:58.680> maps<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.070> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
had you know I got enough maps in the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.320 
had you know I got enough maps in the
game<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.460> I<00:03:59.490> hardly<00:03:59.880> actually<00:04:00.450> play<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.740> maps

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
game and I hardly actually play the maps

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.120 
game and I hardly actually play the maps
that<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:04.020> newer<00:04:04.200> maps<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.890> know<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.010> don't

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
that the newer maps you know I don't

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.560 
that the newer maps you know I don't
really<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.670> whole<00:04:05.880> lot<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.120> them<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.540> far

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
really like a whole lot of them so far

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.120 
really like a whole lot of them so far
as<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.990> map<00:04:07.200> packs<00:04:07.470> ago<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.710> don't<00:04:07.950> really

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
as the map packs ago I don't really

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.440 
as the map packs ago I don't really
think<00:04:08.250> that's<00:04:08.400> what's<00:04:08.670> keeping<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:09.090> fresh<00:04:09.300> I

think that's what's keeping it fresh I

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.940 
think that's what's keeping it fresh I
think<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.780> fact<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.140> they've<00:04:10.350> supported<00:04:10.710> it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
think the fact that they've supported it

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.590 
think the fact that they've supported it
they've<00:04:11.400> patched<00:04:11.700> weapons<00:04:12.210> they<00:04:12.330> patch

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
they've patched weapons they patch

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.140 
they've patched weapons they patch

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.860 
having to worry about a ghost camper and
I<00:04:47.009> think<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.370> new<00:04:47.639> this<00:04:48.120> new<00:04:48.270> playlist<00:04:48.660> will

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
I think this new this new playlist will

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.420 
I think this new this new playlist will
will<00:04:49.259> give<00:04:49.410> us<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.620> fresh<00:04:49.830> take<00:04:50.009> on<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.280> we'll

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
will give us a fresh take on that we'll

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.279 
will give us a fresh take on that we'll
see<00:04:50.610> how<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.759> goes<00:04:50.900> I'm<00:04:51.900> going<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.139> be<00:04:52.199> getting

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
see how it goes I'm going to be getting

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.379 
see how it goes I'm going to be getting
some<00:04:52.590> new<00:04:52.740> playlist<00:04:53.550> gameplay<00:04:53.940> coming<00:04:54.270> up

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
some new playlist gameplay coming up

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.779 
some new playlist gameplay coming up
here<00:04:54.569> soon<00:04:54.810> apparently<00:04:55.500> from<00:04:56.490> what<00:04:56.550> I've

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
here soon apparently from what I've

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.249 
here soon apparently from what I've
heard<00:04:56.819> there's<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.270> lot<00:04:57.599> of<00:04:57.630> noobs<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:58.110> this

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
heard there's a lot of noobs in this

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.680 
heard there's a lot of noobs in this
playlist<00:04:58.500> which<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.069> strange<00:04:59.520> i<00:04:59.909> was

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
playlist which is strange i was

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.600 
playlist which is strange i was
expecting<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.500> opposite<00:05:02.159> i<00:05:02.190> was<00:05:02.340> expecting

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
expecting the opposite i was expecting

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.189 
expecting the opposite i was expecting
it<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.880> be<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.210> bit<00:05:03.330> more<00:05:03.509> competitive

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
it to be a little bit more competitive

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.439 
it to be a little bit more competitive
but<00:05:04.500> i<00:05:04.949> think<00:05:05.460> what<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.699> is<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:05.880> people<00:05:06.330> have

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
but i think what it is is people have

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.629 
but i think what it is is people have
been<00:05:06.630> able<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.110> rely<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:07.740> their<00:05:08.039> ghosts<00:05:08.400> and

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
been able to rely on their ghosts and

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.159 
been able to rely on their ghosts and
second<00:05:08.970> chance<00:05:09.180> for<00:05:09.389> so<00:05:09.569> long<00:05:09.780> even<00:05:10.020> though

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
second chance for so long even though

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.629 
second chance for so long even though
they<00:05:10.830> themselves<00:05:11.190> hate<00:05:11.970> it<00:05:13.159> but<00:05:14.159> now<00:05:14.340> they're

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
they themselves hate it but now they're

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.430 
they themselves hate it but now they're
able<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:15.000> break<00:05:15.599> free<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.319> they

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
able to break free of that and they

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.870 
able to break free of that and they
don't<00:05:16.620> know<00:05:16.710> how<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:16.860> play<00:05:17.130> when<00:05:17.310> there's<00:05:17.460> UAVs

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
don't know how to play when there's UAVs

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.909 
don't know how to play when there's UAVs
up<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.330> we'll<00:05:18.840> see<00:05:18.960> how<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.110> goes<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.740> don't

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
up so we'll see how that goes I don't

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.399 
up so we'll see how that goes I don't
ever<00:05:20.099> use<00:05:20.280> ghost<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.509> get<00:05:21.659> seen<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.050> UAV

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
ever use ghost and I get seen on the UAV

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.770 
ever use ghost and I get seen on the UAV
all<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.710> time<00:05:22.889> guys<00:05:23.159> so<00:05:23.729> I'm<00:05:24.210> interested<00:05:24.750> to

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
all the time guys so I'm interested to

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.610 
all the time guys so I'm interested to
see<00:05:25.169> how<00:05:26.389> how<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.419> do<00:05:27.569> in<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:27.990> playlist<00:05:28.259> i

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
see how how I do in this playlist i

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.379 
see how how I do in this playlist i
think<00:05:29.069> i<00:05:29.130> should<00:05:29.310> do<00:05:29.460> fairly<00:05:29.759> well<00:05:29.970> because<00:05:30.330> i

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
think i should do fairly well because i

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.730 
think i should do fairly well because i
never<00:05:30.449> used<00:05:30.840> ghost<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.169> don't<00:05:31.289> even<00:05:31.349> have<00:05:31.440> ghost

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
never used ghost I don't even have ghost

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.159 
never used ghost I don't even have ghost
pro<00:05:32.039> i<00:05:32.280> think<00:05:32.789> i'm<00:05:32.880> still<00:05:33.150> like<00:05:33.330> six<00:05:33.780> or<00:05:33.960> seven

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
pro i think i'm still like six or seven

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.890 
pro i think i'm still like six or seven
aircraft<00:05:34.919> destroyed<00:05:35.520> things<00:05:36.270> away<00:05:36.630> from

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
aircraft destroyed things away from

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.950 
aircraft destroyed things away from
getting<00:05:37.139> ghost<00:05:37.469> pro<00:05:37.770> so<00:05:38.419> i'm<00:05:39.419> not<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:39.750> sure<00:05:39.780> how

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
getting ghost pro so i'm not so sure how

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.740 
getting ghost pro so i'm not so sure how
well<00:05:40.380> I'll<00:05:40.590> doing<00:05:40.949> it<00:05:41.070> but<00:05:41.280> I'm<00:05:41.550> excited<00:05:42.479> to<00:05:42.599> be

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
well I'll doing it but I'm excited to be

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.570 
well I'll doing it but I'm excited to be
able<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.139> use<00:05:43.440> some<00:05:43.710> of<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.889> crappy<00:05:44.130> weapons

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
able to use some of the crappy weapons

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.730 
able to use some of the crappy weapons
now<00:05:44.789> because<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.659> main<00:05:45.840> thing<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.139> holds<00:05:46.440> me

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
now because the main thing that holds me

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.350 
now because the main thing that holds me
back<00:05:46.770> from<00:05:47.009> using<00:05:47.610> some<00:05:47.789> of<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:47.969> weapons<00:05:48.150> that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
back from using some of the weapons that

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.110 
back from using some of the weapons that
I<00:05:48.479> want<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.750> use<00:05:48.990> is<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:49.550> there's<00:05:50.550> I<00:05:50.759> can't

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
I want to use is that there's I can't

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.529 
I want to use is that there's I can't
use<00:05:51.240> UAVs<00:05:51.750> okay<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.729> think<00:05:53.880> anytime<00:05:54.300> you're

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
use UAVs okay so I think anytime you're

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.480 
use UAVs okay so I think anytime you're
using<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.840> dual<00:05:55.050> scorpions<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.830> you're<00:05:56.340> in

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
using the dual scorpions and you're in

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.879 
using the dual scorpions and you're in
the<00:05:56.639> face<00:05:56.849> type<00:05:57.180> thing<00:05:57.479> ghost<00:05:58.259> campers<00:05:58.710> are

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
the face type thing ghost campers are

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.459 
the face type thing ghost campers are
your<00:05:59.099> biggest<00:05:59.400> enemy<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.120> I<00:06:00.569> think<00:06:00.840> basically

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
your biggest enemy and I think basically

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.010 
your biggest enemy and I think basically
a<00:06:02.069> home<00:06:02.430> that's<00:06:02.789> what<00:06:03.000> keeps<00:06:03.210> me<00:06:03.330> like<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
a home that's what keeps me like the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.279 
a home that's what keeps me like the
infield<00:06:04.349> for<00:06:04.590> example<00:06:05.009> is<00:06:05.159> a<00:06:05.219> poor<00:06:05.610> weapon<00:06:06.289> the

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
infield for example is a poor weapon the

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.050 
infield for example is a poor weapon the
only<00:06:07.620> advantage<00:06:07.860> you<00:06:08.159> ever<00:06:08.430> get<00:06:08.789> with<00:06:08.940> the

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
only advantage you ever get with the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.450 
only advantage you ever get with the
infield<00:06:09.360> is<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.690> fact<00:06:10.199> that<00:06:10.319> it<00:06:10.469> has<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.710> rate

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
infield is the fact that it has a rate

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.969 
infield is the fact that it has a rate
of<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:11.940> know<00:06:12.060> at<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.389> solid<00:06:12.719> rate<00:06:13.020> of<00:06:13.139> fire<00:06:13.380> like

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
of you know at a solid rate of fire like

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.520 
of you know at a solid rate of fire like
it's<00:06:14.130> very<00:06:14.370> manageable<00:06:15.060> and<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.810> recoil<00:06:16.319> on

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
it's very manageable and the recoil on

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.740 
it's very manageable and the recoil on
it<00:06:16.680> is<00:06:16.830> very<00:06:17.130> low<00:06:17.370> okay<00:06:18.150> those<00:06:18.389> are<00:06:18.419> the<00:06:18.630> only

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
it is very low okay those are the only

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.620 
it is very low okay those are the only
advantages<00:06:19.380> as<00:06:19.590> it<00:06:20.039> does<00:06:20.190> low<00:06:20.460> damage<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:21.180> it

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
advantages as it does low damage and it

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.300 
advantages as it does low damage and it
doesn't<00:06:21.960> fire<00:06:22.110> fast<00:06:22.409> enough<00:06:22.740> to<00:06:22.889> make<00:06:23.039> it<00:06:23.219> a

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
doesn't fire fast enough to make it a

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.730 
doesn't fire fast enough to make it a
high<00:06:23.460> tier<00:06:23.699> weapon<00:06:24.090> so<00:06:24.840> basically<00:06:25.590> the

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
high tier weapon so basically the

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.399 
high tier weapon so basically the
infield<00:06:26.280> is<00:06:26.430> outclassed<00:06:26.909> by<00:06:27.180> every<00:06:27.780> weapon<00:06:28.050> or

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
infield is outclassed by every weapon or

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.529 
infield is outclassed by every weapon or
every<00:06:28.680> assault<00:06:29.009> rifle<00:06:29.400> I'd<00:06:29.880> even<00:06:30.180> go<00:06:30.300> as<00:06:30.509> far

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
every assault rifle I'd even go as far

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.450 
every assault rifle I'd even go as far
as<00:06:30.750> to<00:06:30.870> say<00:06:31.110> it's<00:06:31.139> outclassed<00:06:31.710> by<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.919> FAL

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
as to say it's outclassed by the FAL

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.339 
as to say it's outclassed by the FAL
because<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.819> can<00:06:32.969> fire<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.360> FAL<00:06:33.780> almost<00:06:34.199> as

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
because I can fire the FAL almost as

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.730 
because I can fire the FAL almost as
quickly<00:06:34.650> as<00:06:34.889> i<00:06:35.009> can<00:06:35.069> fire<00:06:35.430> this<00:06:35.849> infield

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
quickly as i can fire this infield

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.430 
quickly as i can fire this infield
now<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.550> only<00:06:37.970> weapon<00:06:38.330> it<00:06:38.419> may<00:06:38.660> beat<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.110> think

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
now the only weapon it may beat I think

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.409 
now the only weapon it may beat I think
is<00:06:39.650> and<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.400> right<00:06:40.550> here<00:06:40.729> is<00:06:40.819> that<00:06:41.030> was<00:06:41.180> just<00:06:41.330> a

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
is and the right here is that was just a

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.150 
is and the right here is that was just a
fail<00:06:41.660> mama<00:06:42.259> fast-forward<00:06:42.770> some<00:06:42.919> more<00:06:43.069> because

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
fail mama fast-forward some more because

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.559 
fail mama fast-forward some more because
this<00:06:43.280> is<00:06:43.460> such<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.610> long<00:06:43.699> game<00:06:43.970> it<00:06:44.150> may<00:06:44.330> be<00:06:44.389> the

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
this is such a long game it may be the

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.320 
this is such a long game it may be the
m14<00:06:45.380> and<00:06:45.680> although<00:06:46.099> I<00:06:46.130> do<00:06:46.220> like<00:06:46.430> the<00:06:46.490> m14<00:06:47.060> just

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
m14 and although I do like the m14 just

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.270 
m14 and although I do like the m14 just
has<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.539> different<00:06:47.870> used<00:06:48.050> but<00:06:48.919> I<00:06:48.949> mean<00:06:49.160> you'll

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
has the different used but I mean you'll

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.920
