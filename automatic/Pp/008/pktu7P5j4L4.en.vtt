00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.420
 stefan judge 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 It was a tough one at the beginning 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.070
 gangart for subsequent free kick 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.800
 kicked by thomas the ball comes in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 and in the middle of 2000 strong and strong 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 heads the ball into the corner single 02 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 played minutes with me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.369
 after five winless matches in a row 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.380
 the vfb soon made it clear what today 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 the goal 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.920
 here he never jumps and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.960
 Again , the Brunswick knew 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.000
 Defense only with a foul to help 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.860
 met this time is inhabited 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.110
 from dangerous position he tries it 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.730
 Now marcel ohmann his free kick goes 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.500
 first to the latte then one 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.420
 messed up in the goal area logo becomes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.420
 plays the only one the overview and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.290
 pushes the ball into the gate 2 0 for the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.090
 vfb before the break the mission 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.410
 away win was the latest from now 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.510
 fully in the plan 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.640
 in acute air came only two 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.740
 spectators stood below him 70 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 constituencies becker the expedition 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 perform 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.700
 in the second half came the debeka 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.680
 to further opportunities 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.960
 Here they would have already achieved the 3 2 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.729
 can 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.770
 but it was different suddenly they were 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:38.830
 Brunswick in attack the left 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.720
 here completely free a pass in the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.100
 penalty area and at the end of the fell 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.570
 hit for the Brunswick 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.570
 in the 55th 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.570
 in the summer, the vfb at 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.960
 still win 5 2 1 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.000
 but it did not look like that today 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.070
 Lower Saxony wanted more from now the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.530
 chance to equalize was there at the end 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.060

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.650
 andrÃ© latendorf made in the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.689
 everything is clear 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.729
 this gate, we can not show 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.769
 because the cold in Brunswick, too 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.769
 all technology does not pass without a trace
