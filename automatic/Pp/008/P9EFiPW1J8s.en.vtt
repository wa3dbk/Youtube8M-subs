part of the leaf and again I'm going to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.389 
part of the leaf and again I'm going to
let<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.369> dry<00:01:43.700> on<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.630> flower<00:01:45.409> former<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.159> that

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
let it dry on this flower former so that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.849 
let it dry on this flower former so that
it's<00:01:46.520> got<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.759> little<00:01:46.939> bit<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.329> shape<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.810> it

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
it's got a little bit of a shape to it

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.380 
it's got a little bit of a shape to it
if<00:01:48.859> you<00:01:49.009> find<00:01:49.159> it<00:01:49.340> easier<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.789> start<00:01:50.210> out<00:01:50.299> with

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
if you find it easier to start out with

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.330 
if you find it easier to start out with
the<00:01:50.539> sausage<00:01:51.049> shape<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.649> then<00:01:51.829> kind<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.100> press

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the sausage shape and then kind of press

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.910 
the sausage shape and then kind of press
that<00:01:52.460> into<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.659> groove<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.289> then<00:01:54.500> roll<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
that into the groove and then roll it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.980 
that into the groove and then roll it
out<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.340> works<00:01:55.549> fine<00:01:55.820> just<00:01:56.210> use<00:01:56.719> whatever

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
out that works fine just use whatever

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.840 
out that works fine just use whatever
works<00:01:57.409> for<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.859> just<00:01:58.460> make<00:01:58.609> sure<00:01:58.820> that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
works for you just make sure that

that to lift the gum paste up so nothing

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.220 
that to lift the gum paste up so nothing
gets<00:02:10.400> torn<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.030> again<00:02:11.570> just<00:02:11.810> make<00:02:11.960> sure<00:02:11.990> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.200 
gets torn and again just make sure that
you<00:02:12.500> position<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.040> leaf<00:02:13.220> cutter<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:13.880> the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
you position the leaf cutter so that the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.720 
you position the leaf cutter so that the

just press the front of the leaf into

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.160 
just press the front of the leaf into

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
give the veins on the front of the leaf

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
give the veins on the front of the leaf
and<00:02:30.599> then<00:02:30.870> allow<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.560> dry<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.430> flower

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
and then allow it to dry on the flower

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then allow it to dry on the flower

them<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:36.299> I'm<00:02:36.420> using<00:02:36.569> some<00:02:36.959> forest<00:02:37.709> green

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
them here I'm using some forest green

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.009 
them here I'm using some forest green
and<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.489> think<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.269> believe<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.629> some<00:02:39.750> moss

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
and I think I believe it's some moss

and I think I believe it's some moss
green<00:02:40.349> petal<00:02:41.069> dust<00:02:41.390> again<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.599> just<00:02:42.900> gives

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
green petal dust again this just gives

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.800 
green petal dust again this just gives
the<00:02:43.590> leaves<00:02:43.829> a<00:02:44.159> darker<00:02:44.640> richer<00:02:44.970> green<00:02:45.420> color

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
the leaves a darker richer green color

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900 
the leaves a darker richer green color
you<00:02:46.409> could<00:02:46.590> certainly<00:02:46.829> play<00:02:47.370> around<00:02:47.670> with

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
you could certainly play around with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.300 
you could certainly play around with
different<00:02:47.970> greens<00:02:48.660> depending<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.280> know

what you need these for and what colors

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.330 
what you need these for and what colors
you<00:02:52.140> need<00:02:52.290> them<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.500> be

these<00:02:53.670> are<00:02:53.819> ivy<00:02:54.269> leaves<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.379> know<00:02:55.470> they

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
these are ivy leaves so you know they

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.440 
these are ivy leaves so you know they
need<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.890> kind<00:02:56.129> of<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.340> darker<00:02:56.849> green<00:02:57.209> and

the<00:02:58.440> nice<00:02:58.650> thing<00:02:58.680> about<00:02:58.920> dusting<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.670> leaves

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
the nice thing about dusting the leaves

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.819 
the nice thing about dusting the leaves
with<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.150> petal<00:03:00.480> dust<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.109> really<00:03:01.530> makes

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
with the petal dust is it really makes

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.880 
with the petal dust is it really makes
the<00:03:02.160> veins<00:03:02.459> stand<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.739> know<00:03:04.829> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the veins stand out so that you know you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.890 
the veins stand out so that you know you
can<00:03:05.099> really<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.269> makes<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.629> look<00:03:06.750> more

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
can really see and it makes it look more

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
sped up the video quite a bit so you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.740 
sped up the video quite a bit so you
don't<00:03:11.760> have<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:12.030> spend<00:03:12.299> your<00:03:12.420> entire<00:03:12.480> day

the wax paper to funnel the petal dust

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.170 
the wax paper to funnel the petal dust
back<00:03:23.470> into<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.010> containers<00:03:24.459> again<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.030> is

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
back into the containers again this is

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.569 
back into the containers again this is
why<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.360> like<00:03:25.720> using<00:03:26.110> wax<00:03:26.590> paper<00:03:26.890> when<00:03:27.280> I'm

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
why I like using wax paper when I'm

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.520 
why I like using wax paper when I'm
dusting<00:03:28.060> flowers<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.629> leaves<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.079> that's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
dusting flowers and leaves and that's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.869 
dusting flowers and leaves and that's
what<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:29.799> look<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:29.980> when<00:03:30.700> they're<00:03:30.819> all

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
what they look like when they're all

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.949 
what they look like when they're all
dusted<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.069> steam<00:03:33.069> so<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.879> petal<00:03:34.450> dust

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
dusted and steam so that the petal dust

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.050 
dusted and steam so that the petal dust
you<00:03:35.019> know<00:03:35.140> sticks<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.519> leaves<00:03:36.760> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
you know sticks to the leaves and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180 
you know sticks to the leaves and
doesn't<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.599> know<00:03:37.720> get<00:03:37.930> everywhere<00:03:38.260> now<00:03:39.010> I'm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
doesn't you know get everywhere now I'm

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.280 
doesn't you know get everywhere now I'm
going<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.549> tape<00:03:39.730> them<00:03:39.970> together<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:41.049> like

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
going to tape them together so it's like

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.640 
going to tape them together so it's like
a<00:03:41.470> spray<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.430> ivy<00:03:43.150> leaves<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.659> I'm<00:03:44.409> going<00:03:44.590> to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
a spray of ivy leaves and I'm going to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.160 
a spray of ivy leaves and I'm going to
start<00:03:44.920> off<00:03:45.069> by<00:03:45.099> using<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.269> green<00:03:46.569> florist

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
start off by using this green florist

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.430 
start off by using this green florist
tape<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:47.680> wrapping<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:49.000> wires<00:03:49.239> in<00:03:49.870> this

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
tape and wrapping the wires in this

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.899 
tape and wrapping the wires in this
green<00:03:50.680> florist<00:03:51.069> tape<00:03:51.220> sometimes<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:51.879> be

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
green florist tape sometimes it can be

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.000 
green florist tape sometimes it can be
tricky<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.420> get<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.840> florist<00:03:53.290> tape<00:03:53.440> started

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
tricky to get the florist tape started

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.089 
tricky to get the florist tape started
so<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> usually<00:03:55.150> do<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.959> try<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:56.980> get

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
so what I usually do is is try and get

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.430 
so what I usually do is is try and get
it<00:03:57.220> started<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.639> little<00:03:57.790> bit<00:03:58.030> below<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:59.109> leaf

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
it started a little bit below the leaf

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.220 
it started a little bit below the leaf
go<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> couple<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.909> revolutions<00:04:01.690> around<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
go a couple of revolutions around the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.319 
go a couple of revolutions around the
wire<00:04:02.379> and<00:04:02.709> then<00:04:02.859> push<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.459> tape<00:04:03.700> up<00:04:03.909> against

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
wire and then push the tape up against

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.420 
wire and then push the tape up against
the<00:04:04.450> base<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.200> leaf<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.590> then<00:04:06.040> once<00:04:06.250> it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
the base of the leaf and then once it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.129 
the base of the leaf and then once it
gets<00:04:06.549> started<00:04:06.849> it's<00:04:07.209> usually<00:04:07.569> a<00:04:07.599> pretty<00:04:07.840> quick

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
gets started it's usually a pretty quick

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.129 
gets started it's usually a pretty quick
process<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:09.730> tape<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.120> rest<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.540> wire<00:04:10.720> I'm

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
process to tape the rest of the wire I'm

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.319 
process to tape the rest of the wire I'm
here<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.650> is<00:04:11.709> again<00:04:11.980> sped<00:04:12.370> up<00:04:12.549> so<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:13.090> doesn't

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
here it is again sped up so it doesn't

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.819 
here it is again sped up so it doesn't
take<00:04:13.480> all<00:04:13.629> day<00:04:13.780> for<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.200> watch<00:04:14.349> me<00:04:14.620> you

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
take all day for you to watch me you

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.789 
take all day for you to watch me you
know<00:04:14.950> taping<00:04:15.340> these<00:04:15.489> wires<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.840> taping

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
know taping these wires and so it taping

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.460 
know taping these wires and so it taping
the<00:04:17.979> wires<00:04:18.220> helps<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.239> get<00:04:19.660> them<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.380> know

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
the wires helps to get them to you know

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.110 
the wires helps to get them to you know
kind<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.709> adhere<00:04:21.100> together<00:04:21.250> when<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.060> to

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
kind of adhere together when you go to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.200 
kind of adhere together when you go to
tape<00:04:22.539> them<00:04:22.720> all<00:04:22.840> together<00:04:23.110> as<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.650> spray<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.940> I'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
tape them all together as a spray so I'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.870 
tape them all together as a spray so I'm
just<00:04:25.389> going<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.720> quickly<00:04:26.530> tape<00:04:27.160> all<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
just going to quickly tape all of the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.930 
just going to quickly tape all of the
wires<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.900> leaves<00:04:29.169> on<00:04:29.410> them<00:04:29.680> and<00:04:29.940> now

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
wires that have leaves on them and now

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.300 
wires that have leaves on them and now
I'm<00:04:31.120> going<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.539> tape<00:04:31.990> them<00:04:32.229> together<00:04:32.470> here<00:04:33.190> you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
I'm going to tape them together here you

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.670 
I'm going to tape them together here you
can<00:04:33.490> be<00:04:33.639> creative<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.930> arrange<00:04:35.349> them

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
can be creative and you can arrange them

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.409 
can be creative and you can arrange them
pretty<00:04:36.070> much<00:04:36.250> however<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.699> want<00:04:36.970> you're

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
pretty much however you want you're

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.659 
pretty much however you want you're
going<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.630> start<00:04:37.960> with<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.260> central<00:04:39.010> leaf<00:04:39.340> and

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
going to start with a central leaf and

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.150 
going to start with a central leaf and
then<00:04:40.210> this<00:04:40.419> is<00:04:40.599> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.380> wire<00:04:41.590> to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
then this is going to be the wire to

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.670 
then this is going to be the wire to
which<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.520> attach<00:04:42.639> all<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.479> other<00:04:43.780> wires<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
which you attach all the other wires and

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.610 
which you attach all the other wires and
here<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.490> have<00:04:45.729> sped<00:04:46.000> up<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.150> video<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
here I have sped up the video in the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.950 
here I have sped up the video in the
interest<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.070> saving<00:04:48.430> time<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:49.419> you<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.810> get

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
interest of saving time but you can get

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.290 
interest of saving time but you can get
an<00:04:50.050> idea<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.530> how<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.039> can<00:04:51.550> attach<00:04:51.849> all<00:04:52.120> these

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
an idea of how you can attach all these

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.540 
an idea of how you can attach all these
leaves<00:04:52.630> together<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.440> then<00:04:53.979> if<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.520> are

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
leaves together and then if you are

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.670 
leaves together and then if you are
going<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.849> add<00:04:55.270> some<00:04:55.630> flowers<00:04:56.229> or<00:04:56.260> whatever

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
going to add some flowers or whatever

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.050 
going to add some flowers or whatever
else<00:04:57.160> you're<00:04:57.280> going<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.460> add<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.910> know<00:04:58.000> you

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
else you're going to add you know you

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.240 
else you're going to add you know you
can<00:04:58.270> piece<00:04:58.510> together<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:59.229> pretty<00:04:59.650> elaborate

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
can piece together a pretty elaborate

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.330 
can piece together a pretty elaborate
floral<00:05:00.760> arrangement<00:05:01.659> to<00:05:02.169> go<00:05:02.380> on<00:05:02.770> your<00:05:03.159> cake

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
floral arrangement to go on your cake

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.100 
floral arrangement to go on your cake
once<00:05:03.909> they're<00:05:04.060> all<00:05:04.180> taped<00:05:04.389> together<00:05:04.599> you<00:05:04.960> can

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
once they're all taped together you can
