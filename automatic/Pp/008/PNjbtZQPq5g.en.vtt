00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello how about friends here with you from 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.240
 dogs and this time I'm going to 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.060
 teach a new deck that I think that 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.020
 It comes out as the starter in three days of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.160
 constructor of sincro nes I did not take 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.369
 the freedom to make a version 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.980
 Customized bone I'm obviously already 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.990
 testing all the versions there is not 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.660
 and this was the one I liked the most because 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.550
 He carries a letter that made me despair 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.000
 on this team to be so broken but 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.620
 it's very very very very good so here 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.390
 between us I tell them to buy the ones that 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.660
 can because if it's going to get very 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.940
 little face will not at least go up is not 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.820
 letter is the fusion brilat then it's 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.460
 a quick drop version 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 who uses it and who is very good like that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.160
 Let's start with the techno analysis 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.500
 well, this leaves that is dedicated 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.750
 devotes to practically invoke quasar 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.310
 dragon shooting quasar dragon of many 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.000
 ways though you can also win 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.740
 with them this 5 level 8 that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280
 well they still do not come out but you can 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.560
 put other level 8 and you can win 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 Well , well, in many ways, but not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.640
 itself the way principle contrition the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.890
 not in itself the main way is doing 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.229
 quasar not as you do quasar good then 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.030
 let's start with the one with the base I'm not going to 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.890
 explain the combos since it would take away 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 all the fun to the video that is me 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.850
 like disarm on the deck copy this 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.630
 version and you changed me what 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 you like it and you see the combos 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.009
 but what I can tell you is that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 letters take so they do not miss it 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 searching and analysis of the ex 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.409
 gameplay I put the one of an 8 for 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.079
 what because he gets to have hands that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.240
 they lock and where there is no defense 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.640
 then he is very vulnerable to being read 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.860
 write down something like that 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 I think workshop will be workshop , a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.510
 workshop or 1.5 I do not see it as workshop one 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.090
 I do not see it either as a workshop two maybe 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.640
 I was doing workshop two workshop 1.5 ok 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.330
 the ability to play from 1 to 10 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.350
 I needed 189 skill almost the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.040
 top level of micros yes 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.350
 and unless they serve silvan is 10 out of 10 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.660
 this a 9 for ability to play or 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.000
 that the parameters that I use to 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.830
 analyze a deck and now version 3 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.420
 club without krone of law and 3/4 without krone and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.310
 32 the oven guard that are the ones 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 they do the combos together with level iter 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.110
 three mathematicians to send to 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.070
 cemetery to jackson chrome or to the level and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.160
 ter since mathematical five ago with 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.650
 makes combo with quick draw making rice 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.990
 you now do the play and 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.680
 will see how, but practically it is going down to 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.580
 mathematician commands the leb the iter and makes 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.310
 culture 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.520
 they went down kuyt but not from there rod warrior 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.150
 road warrior invoked of the dec diet without 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.860
 great and you invoke the level and you of the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
 cemetery the synchronous session 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.180
 aggregation goals to revive jett and I'll 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.970
 to be reality level and teri can be 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.950
 with you do not ching ground that is him 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.400
 note is the only letter of the new 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.730
 structure 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.439
 that I used that I saw that it was like good 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.510
 the best really not 12 weiler 2 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:34.200
 weak and have a bolt voice but you know 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.859
 always goes and the gem engine in another gem 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.930
 It's great because you have to send to 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.260
 tri cloud together with any of these 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.430
 two 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.109
 garnett or blue and to follow 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.680
 seraphim and that gives you a normal added a 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.959
 extra so he's super sick 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.659
 because useful active fusion does it will be 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.730
 define back trick cloud and you the 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.620
 you have normal the tumor you have two 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.569
 Normal adding to what the same 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.049
 pressure is that it gives you a monkey in the field 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.569
 level 5 a level 4 monkey and gives you 2 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.790
 normal summons that most wanted supporters 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.250
 then it is very very good also it is 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.049
 samur sugar the number 2 about five 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970
 but the advantage is that you can extract it 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.919
 with ready for sweet and with the rest 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.560
 You can also bring to Europe the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.259
 guardian or even eggs and then 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.150
 this pulse are the combos that can be 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.600
 are the letters that I put him not also 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.310
 tuning reinforcements of the army 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.580
 line control police several communities 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.590
 porto 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.229
 I highly recommend this one of the truth 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.729
 right now they are going to say how many letters like this 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.580
 already crazy but when they play it they go to 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.030
 see is very bastard and try to buy it 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.699
 I 'm going to make a recommendation 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.460
 hole those who see the video before 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.750
 that the structure they buy 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.340
 these letters already know that who has 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.969
 filled in the realistic ones we are all 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.969
 all of you 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.220
 buy bible inflection and buy so much 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.950
 because in all the versions that are 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.840
 play is going to carry this those cards and 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.060
 they are very good and with their formulas because 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.140
 for that they are going to put faces so a 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.500
 greeting here in the field of 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.500
 analysis realistic kisses chau
