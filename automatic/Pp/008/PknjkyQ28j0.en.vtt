there's two bolts holding the cover

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.620 
there's two bolts holding the cover
right<00:01:11.350> around<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:12.610> one<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:12.940> here<00:01:18.300> in<00:01:19.300> there

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
right around just one in here in there

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
right around just one in here in there
and<00:01:19.900> one<00:01:20.050> on<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.230> other<00:01:20.320> side

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.230 

once<00:01:33.130> these<00:01:33.400> bolts<00:01:33.790> are<00:01:33.940> out<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.850> throttle

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
once these bolts are out this throttle

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.330 
once these bolts are out this throttle
linkage<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.080> connected<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:38.950> turn<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
linkage is connected and so you turn the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.930 
linkage is connected and so you turn the
carburetor<00:01:39.760> like<00:01:39.940> this<00:01:40.620> sideways

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
carburetor like this sideways

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.670 
carburetor like this sideways
and<00:01:42.940> just<00:01:43.120> slide<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.540> off<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.750> then<00:01:50.080> you'll

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
and just slide it off and then you'll

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.940 
and just slide it off and then you'll
need<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.010> disconnect<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.550> fuel<00:01:51.790> hose<00:01:52.030> as<00:01:52.950> well

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
need to disconnect the fuel hose as well

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.340 
need to disconnect the fuel hose as well
if<00:01:54.250> there's<00:01:54.580> fuel<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.300> your<00:01:55.600> petrol<00:01:56.110> tank

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
if there's fuel in your petrol tank

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.780 
if there's fuel in your petrol tank
you'll<00:01:57.220> be<00:01:57.310> best<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.700> lift<00:01:57.910> it<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.150> high<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.830> do

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
you'll be best to lift it up high and do

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.930 
you'll be best to lift it up high and do
it<00:02:00.910> up<00:02:01.000> here<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.920> once<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.370> got<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.610> up<00:02:06.729> high

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
it up here then once you got it up high

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.870 
it up here then once you got it up high
I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.649> find<00:02:08.890> some<00:02:09.100> way<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.280> keep<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.760> there

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
I have to find some way to keep it there

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.940 
I have to find some way to keep it there
so<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.420> fuel<00:02:10.630> doesn't<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.530> come<00:02:11.590> out<00:02:13.950> when

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
so the fuel doesn't all come out when

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.290 
so the fuel doesn't all come out when
you<00:02:15.040> take<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> carburetor<00:02:15.640> off<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:16.270> careful

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.080 
you take the carburetor off be careful
not<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.020> lose<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.380> rubber<00:02:17.650> seal<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.160> without

the<00:02:19.210> seal<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> carburetor<00:02:20.080> won't<00:02:20.260> function

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the seal the carburetor won't function

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.330 
the seal the carburetor won't function

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
forward position so this tab here sits

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.309 
forward position so this tab here sits
behind<00:05:54.169> the<00:05:54.620> choke<00:05:55.630> because<00:05:56.630> if<00:05:56.870> that<00:05:56.990> tabs

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
behind the choke because if that tabs

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.629 
behind the choke because if that tabs
sitting<00:05:57.620> in<00:05:57.710> front<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:58.009> the<00:05:58.130> choke<00:05:58.370> in<00:05:58.580> the
