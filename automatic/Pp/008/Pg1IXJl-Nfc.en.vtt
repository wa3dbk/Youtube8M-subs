00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.210
 hello again dear visitors 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.690
 my site 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.880
 goalkeeper in today's form of lessons I want you 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.979
 to tell 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.949
 and creating animations percentage created 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.489
 models in the program courts docs 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.949
 quite a while ago I was going to do it 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.929
 This kind of video lessons but everything like that 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.800
 did not reach the hands here you collected your thoughts 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.789
 Now I will tell you how to add a fluff 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.409
 animation soligorsk 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.429
 I made a percentage of the assembly where 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460
 added 2 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 here such 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.260
 clement they are taken standard 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 from from library tuba ksk 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.650
 here is boxing 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.860
 and juicy element 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.670
 four wheel tooth 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.250
 I took this straight from the side of the channel 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.250
 mechanical gears 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.040
 she created arranged 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.940
 relatively each other fixed 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.160
 fixing must be removed so that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.620
 percent 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.140
 leave percentage free only for 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.620
 torque 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.570
 the wheel is fully fixed only 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.520
 rotates around its axis 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 when his son contacts him to tell 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.710
 I will not be more detailed 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 I think that there is nothing complicated 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.790
 Danny Hust Demand Should Not 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.230
 open up 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.800
 bookmark research here 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.780
 movements 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.640
 beer appears here so here 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.080
 socket 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 first you need to add the engine 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.780
 engine 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.720
 m here are the settings here 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.930
 choose the engine rotating 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 rotating levitin 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 their location grows 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.460
 many residents 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 choose 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.240
 let's say a year 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.420
 under this edge 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.780
 let's say from 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.830
 in particular dill kozma percent she 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.590
 showed the direction of movement 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.800
 you can swap back let's say 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.130
 the side 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.629
 m component for movement 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 boot can choose the second component 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.839
 now you need to comply 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.199
 contact 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.419
 that is, let the program that we have 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.419
 since these elements of the traffic segment 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.439
 here we choose 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.229
 the details 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.249
 yes make sure you have colleagues here 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.229
 basic assembly movement 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.189
 both call traffic earlier 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.289
 here is the basic movement 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.819
 and you can now press a button 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.589
 read the calculation of the study 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.459
 movements 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.089
 press 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.079
 program produced 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.079
 necessary calculations 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.089
 here 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.899
 compute speed down depends on 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:09.609
 power of your computer years 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 presets 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.059
 that's when the calculations are ready 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.279
 click on play 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.279
 and enjoy the work done 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.609
 rub that's all I wanted 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.989
 tell on this short 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.479
 video lessons 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:31.619
 that's all 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.479
 ribbon in meeting all the best
