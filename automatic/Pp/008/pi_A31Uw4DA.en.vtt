00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.939
 storm against 2 caner camera because I do not know 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.009

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.300

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.769
 custom in having peace in peace 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.830

 james storm cost him hard to win 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.620
 that I had redeemed the feed 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 it's like a banquet money today they win 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.329
 in which there are four hung 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.580
 and there's a layoff an opportunity for the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.880
 title of the division into one unit per 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.190

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.580
 heavyweight title that is this the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.580
 that won, but that james storm 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.780
 when he exchanged the combat 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.780
 willing to victory 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.539
 so I do not know I do not know if you have 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.539
 it is understood 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.530
 I think spirit of fire is to make 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.850
 fidel 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850
 it's because it just came 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.670
 again I reverse it damn 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.370
 as ray-ban 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.240
 fuck 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.370
 I'm bursting but they return many 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.430
 then I reverse everything not all much 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.430
 to the first 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 and it starts I said it 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.239
 memory 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.620
 there is with strength mats that has 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.620
 what to win 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.410
 there are other matches that I also 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.380
 would like to do but we can not because 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.910
 there are combats for management 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.170
 well there's no 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.290
 you can say we have explained 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.810
 they are cell battles of 5 against 5 in 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.030
 the same cell that makes 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.390
 it's so cool but we do not have 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.390
 cheeses 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.590
 and to do it badly because he did not go over 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.590
 do what 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.710
 your place 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.459
 we can win now 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.459
 good quick 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.420
 these erdogan dolphins I think we 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.100
 they had subject in order and be 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.580
 is that I just downloaded the chaos of 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.740
 win because I did not have him 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.280
 and honestly there was none that 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.280
 I converted 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.370
 so they come 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.870
 Well you are friends what story more 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.820

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.770
 it's worth there 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.810
 victory for meat I hope that I have 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.160
 liked I'm unhappy with the philips 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.410

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.350

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.980
