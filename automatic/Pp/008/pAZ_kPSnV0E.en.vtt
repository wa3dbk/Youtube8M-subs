least<00:02:50.180> before<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.540> patch<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.140> there

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
least before the patch because there

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080 
least before the patch because there
will<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> patch<00:02:52.769> release<00:02:53.069> them<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.970> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
will be a patch release them but the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.869 
will be a patch release them but the
overpowered<00:02:54.780> ruble<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.530> hopefully<00:02:56.159> that<00:02:56.760> will

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
overpowered ruble so hopefully that will

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.449 
overpowered ruble so hopefully that will
be<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> fixed<00:02:57.780> after<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.680> no<00:02:58.950> week<00:02:59.250> or

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
change the team a little bit because I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.400 
change the team a little bit because I
wasn't<00:04:42.300> really<00:04:42.510> playing<00:04:42.810> well<00:04:42.990> with<00:04:43.139> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
wasn't really playing well with the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.500 
wasn't really playing well with the
Brazilian<00:04:44.070> skill<00:04:44.370> team<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:45.000> also<00:04:45.240> i'm

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
Brazilian skill team and also i'm

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.150 
Brazilian skill team and also i'm
playing<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.990> finals<00:04:46.410> right<00:04:46.560> now<00:04:46.590> so<00:04:47.130> i

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
playing the finals right now so i

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.340 
playing the finals right now so i
decided<00:04:47.730> to<00:04:48.000> do<00:04:48.720> changed<00:04:48.990> up<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.110> team

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
decided to do changed up the team

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.440 
decided to do changed up the team
because<00:04:49.650> i<00:04:49.860> was<00:04:50.130> most<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.030> time<00:04:51.210> playing

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
because i was most of the time playing

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.940 
because i was most of the time playing
with<00:04:51.600> his<00:04:51.720> team<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.200> i<00:04:52.560> thought<00:04:52.740> i<00:04:52.800> would

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
with his team and i thought i would

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.500 
with his team and i thought i would
finish<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.430> off<00:04:53.610> with<00:04:53.639> his<00:04:53.910> team<00:04:54.090> as<00:04:54.240> well<00:04:54.360> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
finish it off with his team as well and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.360 
finish it off with his team as well and
then<00:04:54.600> look<00:04:54.780> at<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.050> goal<00:04:55.320> by<00:04:55.350> Ben<00:04:55.680> Arfa<00:04:56.010> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
then look at this goal by Ben Arfa it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.010 
then look at this goal by Ben Arfa it
wasn't<00:04:56.730> really<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.090> finish<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.540> does<00:04:57.810> it

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
wasn't really the finish that does it

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.930 
wasn't really the finish that does it
but<00:04:58.290> look<00:04:58.650> at<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.950> free<00:04:59.250> cake<00:04:59.490> look<00:04:59.730> at<00:04:59.850> the
