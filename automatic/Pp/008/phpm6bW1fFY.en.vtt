00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.859
 created by patrick boos grouping 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.170
 real facts 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 odd curious is amazing it's 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 then had a book and then a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 youtube broadcast and it's probably 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 there that most of you the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 know to me I've known him since 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.650
 exoct his show where he was already talking 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.939
 strange and curious things nan but 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.009
 stop I come from his mistakes between 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.280
 seaweed is your phone there not the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:34.229
 you do not care about me show me that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:37.520
 me by name but pretty disgusting all 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.110
 web everyone has his secret garden 1 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 and today access is also a comic 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 130 pages extraordinary she will be 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.659
 already in the process because 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 Patrick did not do things to 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.180
 half 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.619
 he asked to trets height to choose 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750
 their favorite stories on his blog 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.950
 and adapt it to concrete what wants 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.530
 to say that he had total freedom 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.440
 writing staging drawings 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.480
 and even of nothing 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.550
 re prediction to the authors and this is the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.630
 second incredible point of this comic 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.700
 the authors 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.010
 thirteen prestigious names such as boulay 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.750
 and erwann surcouf Yannick Lejeune lebanon 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.310
 or even montai marion and who she 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.810
 also likes to teach us things 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.480
 incredible but real teeth you will die 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.340
 less stupid I'm going to die alone and I 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.890
 will never meet blick off debt 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.630
 I would never have the baby liquor but 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.270
 stop you stop is just a big 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 flow in a suit a suit 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.910
 no you read rope but I will prove to you 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.630
 more patrick then we do not wait 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.490
 patrick patrick is interspersed these 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.740
 stories of small additions very interesting 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.360
 like a cabinet of curiosities that you 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.760
 will learn for example that the last 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.140
 guillotined person in France was 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.580
 four months after the release of star wars 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.080
 there is also a presentation of the five 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.270
 Outstanding trees populating our 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.470
 planet and an amazing bestiary 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.920
 illustrated by loop I'm seen in this 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.900
 cloakroom 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:16.180
 No, because unicorns do not exist 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:17.620
 not by the waters of the dugout to ben will be 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.910
 maybe a collective comic that you 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 will learn things through his 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.270
 thirteen stories sometimes funny 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.340
 sometimes scary but always 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.050
 astonishing as any collective you go 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.910
 inevitably preferred some stories to 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.510
 others my favorite and that of the chicken 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.040
 headless 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.720
 a crazy story that sticks 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.670
 perfectly to humor and style 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.300
 libon graphic the art of my authors 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 favorite 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.019
 except this little defect that is not 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.030
 really a board game ax lot to all 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.920
 except for very young people who could be 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.520
 impressed by two three stories of 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.650
 this dear patrick 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.650
 I stayed
