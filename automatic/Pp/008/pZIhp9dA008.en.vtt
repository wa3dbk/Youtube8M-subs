00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Great fighters in the tenth edition 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 interesting facts you will learn how 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.700
 dilute the leisurely gameplay of one of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 British Fri-Sau on what basis 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.349
 card balance for various modes 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.630
 games and why Soviet engineers built 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 tanks without guns and also in honor of our 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 anniversary we decided to dilute the next 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 a selection of interesting facts facts about 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:30.199
 interesting facts 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:32.969
 Well, do not get confused then go 0 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.320
 exactly as many interesting authors 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.320
 facts found in the random 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 The first issue of the program was released 4 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.170
 October 2014 on the channel here is the abyss 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.510
 video duration and 36 seconds 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.510
 contains as many as three facts 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.710
 from the second issue on the channel year pan 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.030
 interesting facts began to be diluted 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.030
 various tricky questions 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.260
 with update 096 the opportunity 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.360
 change the main profession tanker but 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.010
 for some reason during the boot battle so far 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.660
 then you can read a message in which 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.229
 says that the main profession 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.040
 tankman 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.040
 you can not change 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.079
 most of the premium world of 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.079
 tanks have a preferential level of battles 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.929
 beneficiaries are among ordinary cars so 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.780
 for example heavy tanks 4 tv-2 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.060
 b1 and misses to the Six and Easy 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.159
 tank of the second level panzerkampfwagen 1 and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.079
 does have the ability to nakostylyat in 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.079
 randomly only your classmates 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 just so many times I had to talk about 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.369
 the largest tank ammunition without 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.770
 machine gun thanks to you 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.610
 the audience finally found out that 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.469
 this moment 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.259
 the leader on this indicator is 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.259
 french pt 2 level reno try 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.659
 letters that help in creating 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.159
 editions are sorted into four folders 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.069
 depending on the letter she fall 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.780
 the best are bad or 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.780
 is in the tricky question section 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.590
 perhaps the most curious machine 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.750
 load has stock gun Fri-Sau 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.569
 at-7 this is all known 6 pounds to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.659
 more precisely its aviation modification under 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.540
 the name of the mullins gun is usually on a7 when 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.519
 buying immediately puts tapping 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 17-pound cannon examined at at-8 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.959
 and so with the british drum this fr 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.180
 there is practically no saud at random 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.769
 but stock hole punch can be put 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
 especially for fan and surprise 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.299
 opponents who are not usually ready 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.340
 getting went by well every second 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.849
 Drum tape cassette has 10 shells 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.049
 total damage of 750 units 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.030
 shoots in 10 seconds 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.519
 recharges in just twelve 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.260
 180 millimeter penetration 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.709
 quite enough to shoot with 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.819
 classmates during the second world 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.620
 57mm mullins gun 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.180
 installed on the assault version 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 multipurpose bomber 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.040
 royal air force up to overland mosquito for 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.870
 combat heavy armored vehicles and 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.900
 surfaced submarines 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.909
 in the life of this instrument had in cassette 21 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.129
 projectiles excellent accuracy but 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.900
 land version of this automatic 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.489
 guns that the British planned 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.290
 install almost your whole 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.479
 armored vehicles adopted not 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.310
 was due to the appearance of the first tigers 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:29.810
 north african preferences in the end 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.810
 gave 17 pounds 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.920
 world of tanks there are several modes 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.390
 Fight in random in addition to the standard can 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.970
 optionally include yourself in line for 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.590
 assault or head-to-head combat but underwent 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
 changes in these battles are not only 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.280
 conditions for achieving victory but cards on 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.680
 which these battles occur 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.180
 terrain adjustment does not end 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.670
 unnecessary movements of respawns and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.560
 strategic points in some cases 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.319
 along with this, the general view is modified 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.120
 card itself on erlenberg for example in 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.100
 squared d2 during the assault can 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.080
 find additional stone but on 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.090
 Enske loophole in a ruined building in 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.660
 Depending on the mode, then covered with piles 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.880
 debris 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.660
 it gives you the opportunity to shoot from there 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.660
 the enemy 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.720
 since the fifth issue one of 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.239
 The narrated facts are historically 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.150
 also he is the fifth and in order 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:24.620
 video appearances 6 except the first 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.050
 release precisely so many 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.330
 facts we try to share with you in 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.110
 each of their videos and one Soviet 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.850
 missile tank taken into service in 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.480
 1968 it was built on the base 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.470
 experienced medium tank object 140 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.880
 tank fighter design not 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.610
 implied standard 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.050
 guns instead and t1 from started 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.139
 retractable installation complex 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.510
 guided missile weapons in 2k 4 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.880
 dragon and loading mechanism in which 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.010
 placed 12 guided missiles in 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.350
 as additional weapons on and 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.270
 p1 was installed machine gun p-cad with 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.580
 ammunition in 2000 rounds 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.630
 the crew was 3 people 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.930
 driver mechanic 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.270
 shooter operator and tank commander herself 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.250
 the car had a welded body borrowed 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.620
 the serial tank t-62 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.169
 on arms of the Soviet army and p1 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.180
 consisted of three years trial process and 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.169
 operating rocket complex revealed 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.450
 high reliability up to 90 6.7 percent 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.550
 however large dimensions and weight 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.650
 outdated element base is large 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.720
 dead zone and oddly enough lack 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.020
 Pushkin's tanks caused the withdrawal 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.120
 and t1 with weapons in combat these 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.810
 machines did not participate and for export not 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.340
 were delivered 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.350
 there are at least two in the game 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.670
 engine which is not put on one 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.450
 of the currently submitted 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.340
 technicians 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.110
 such aggregates can be found on 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.040
 stock after various Alan fish 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.440
 game updates 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.270
 maybe you have something in stock 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.460
 like now smoothly go to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.620
 final part of the release last time we 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.810
 asked the question on which tank in the game 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.150
 written the name of the company that his 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.070
 it turns out even we 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.710
 initially did not know all the machines 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.170
 suitable for this description but thanks 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.000
 by your answer and painstaking study 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.790
 technicians can safely say that 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.770
 There are several such tanks, namely shouting 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.750
 39 somua sau 40 buds with h 35 and his 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.820
 trophy german gather french 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.260
 origin panzerkampfwagen 38 already 735 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.780
 partly to this list can be ranked 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.810
 also premium premium 2 with barely 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.460
 legible tablet on vld although not 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.470
 I think that even with him this list 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.540
 will prove complete and if you know more 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.160
 any similar tank let's get together 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.560
 discuss about this in 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.270
 comments but anyway since 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.430
 none of the letters contained 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.510
 detailed listing of all suitable 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.940
 under the description of technology 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.680
 so for 1000 gold, we decided to give 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.350
 those three guys who are the first 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.330
 sent the letter with the most 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.010
 suitable tanchiki to properly 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.780
 issue a letter with an answer to a tricky 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.340
 question this release don't forget 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.590
 read information link to 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.990
 which will be in the description to get more 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.180
 yellow game coins can be sent 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.610
 your interesting facts or your tricky 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.680
 question to us in the mail and if your facts 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.500
 or your question will get us release you for 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.380
 each get 1000 gold waiting for your 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.180
 letters on here is a fact dog jim mail.com 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.180
 I liked the video too lazy to put 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.600
 Lenin 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.600
 and have fun 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.660
 weaving 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.500
 subscribe to the channel here's a fan is not 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.970
 want to skip the next issue a 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.100
 if this is not enough you can 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.570
 also look at our feeds links in 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:51.520
 describing many tanks in the game 

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.130
 have on their hull towing 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.450
 ropes that's why this time we 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.940
 would like to ask you 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.520
 let's start the case this cable is fixed 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:03.700
 form rotated 90 degrees latin 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.890
 numbers equal to the level of this machine answers 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.090
 With screenshots of this tank, we are waiting at the post office 

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.090
 before communication
