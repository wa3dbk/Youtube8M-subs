 the Colombian edwin cardona gives us 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
 one of the best exhibitions 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 personal in the history of anyone 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.349
 of the two stadiums go that we're going to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 have fun these last months in the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.560
 technological field while mohamed 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.899
 keep giving quality minutes to 10 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.119
 Colombian is the poet heron in the 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.489
 Oscar Sanchez Jaime is also on the table 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.340
 luna raúl cor y ciordia and al 2 variaías 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.940
 raul your first impressions some 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.180
 hours after cardona show 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.980
 I want to congratulate you on him because they gave 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.590
 a show regarding the transmission 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.190
 and the one who made the show is called 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.309
 cardona that I did not tell you in the end that 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.590
 follow the game that there is no half time 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.070
 I think that many times he 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.870
 start in the dressing room, leave it in 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.180
 December we have the information that 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.650
 cardona was the Colombian reinforcement that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.600
 least liked antonio mohamed 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 I am sure that the passage of the weeks 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.350
 things have changed a lot 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.210
 Jaime moon good morning they are very 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.460
 good morning evidently the week 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.190
 last we played the theme that had 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.289
 to scold Cardona to offer 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.360
 what he did against pachuca and he wanted it 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.580
 against querétaro I told them that 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.490
 you have to give them confidence and a 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.470
 crack like the one we have to give 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.080
 trust and that's what he does and is the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.479
 third best player from South America yesterday 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.640
 he said 'that now he showed what 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.890
 demonstrated and always and simply is a 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.050
 crack and we are in a luxury 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.670
 we have a luxury but what I am 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.130
 eager to know the point of view of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.400
 Oscar Sanchez because in all your right 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 oscar 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.960
 I do not know if you still think cardona is not going 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.310
 to adapt to what Antonio intends 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.810
 mohamed after yesterday's performance 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.480
 I do not like to hear your point 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.710
 good morning view good morning 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.660
 consequently, I continue to believe what 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 same I think he is a great player 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.670
 technical quality that we all like 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.470
 see it definitely but I do not know what 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 his rivals will allow him so much 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.900
 be able to perform as he did yesterday and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.210
 I even think that my opinion supports me 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.160
 the declaration of Antonio Mohamed al 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.010
 term of the game said is a player 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
 you have to know when to put and 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.180
 today was a moment that I thought was 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.160
 good to put it but I think that that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
 says that mohamed you keep thinking what 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.910
 same is that it is not for everyone 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.740
 matches are already three triumphs of the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.870
 monterrey gang in the three the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.940
 directly involved sherwin cardona 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.130
 goal of pachuca triumph for the monterrey 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.550
 goal against querétaro 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.680
 monterrey now cardona trump goals 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.240
 before the red devils of toluca and with 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.880
 this already binds two parties so 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.020
 consecutive of superb performances 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.760
 midweek in the cup against veracruz 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
 now in the league against toluca the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.100
 poet jaime heron good morning good 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.720
 days 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.810
 colleagues, it seems to me that we are talking about a 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.040
 out of series and showed it in each 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.220
 of the shares that you have had 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.410
 cardona has left a very clear message 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.240
 who is a first-class player is a 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.670
 player who has to be on the court 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.150
 that is a soccer player that to the commitment 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.700
 do not dodge it because we remember the type 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.740
 he mentioned us in the previous day the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.870
 day 2 when he was criticized for his 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.200
 weight that he was one of the three best 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.970
 america players is not easy 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.880
 declare it but it's not easy after 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.980
 endorse that statement it 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.510
 compromised and see that little by little 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.270
 demonstrating its great value here in the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.980
 Mexican soccer and after yesterday no 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.610
 he only makes three goals if he does not dare 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.310
 to say you can do more pacifier 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.480
 I soften you at home, go rubbing 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.280
 hands because at any time 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.110
