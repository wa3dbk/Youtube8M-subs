all<00:01:17.180> right<00:01:17.360> reasons<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.870> that<00:01:17.900> no<00:01:18.200> fault<00:01:18.530> turn

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
all right reasons is that no fault turn

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.500 
all right reasons is that no fault turn
on<00:01:19.100> no<00:01:19.250> fall<00:01:19.490> that's<00:01:19.940> gonna<00:01:20.090> probably<00:01:20.270> work

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
on no fall that's gonna probably work

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.320 
on no fall that's gonna probably work
sneak<00:01:21.020> climb<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.760> those<00:01:22.910> they<00:01:23.000> have<00:01:23.090> speed

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
sneak climb so those they have speed

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.590 
sneak climb so those they have speed
