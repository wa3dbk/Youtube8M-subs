00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.460
 Hello and welcome to Mona cooks. 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.580
 Today I show you my recipe for fried paprika-onion vegetables. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.280
 Paprika is a very versatile and healthy vegetable. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.039
 Whether cooked cold or warm, it tastes delicious and adds color to every dish. 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.310
 And how the whole thing is prepared, I'll show you now. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:39.910
 As ingredients I take onions, paprika, soy sauce, pepper, salt and a little oil for frying. 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.790
 First, I will peel the onions, cut in half and cut into thin strips. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.690
 Then the peppers are washed, gutted and cut into small, bite-sized pieces. 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.800
 Then it goes on at the stove. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.070
 All ingredients are now prepared. 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.670
 Since the pan is heated very high, I prefer to take a steel pan. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.079
 It may also be quiet one made of cast iron. 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.079
 Coated pans are not suitable because such high temperatures these pans 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.079
 damage. 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.030
 First, the pan is heated dry. 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.880
 When it's hot, I'll put in a tablespoon of oil. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.939
 It's best to spread it all over the bottom of the pan. 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.229
 Now get hot. 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.409
 In the hot oil, I first give the onions. 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.020
 The onions need something longer than the bell pepper. 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 Then distribute and sear to the highest level. 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.600
 They are not salted. 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.170
 The salt would drain their water and they would be cooked rather soft than crisp 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.389
 fried. 

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:42.479
 Salt and pepper comes at the end. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.310
 Do not stir the onions at first, so that a fine crust can form. 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.579
 But you can also look carefully later on the edge. 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.399
 If the first need crusts are visible, you can turn them over. 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.310
 Then roast again sharply. 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.009
 It will take a few minutes. 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.990
 When they look like that, they often have to be stirred so they do not burn. 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.519
 If they are appetizing brown, the heat is reduced. 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.530
 Then deglaze with a tablespoon of soy sauce. 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.800
 This must now be stirred very quickly, because soy sauce burns easily. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.379
 Onions are now ready and put on a plate. 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.900
 That's how it looks now and is set aside. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.530
 For the peppers, the pan is heated again. 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.459
 In the pan is still some oil left over from roasting the onions. 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.909
 This is supplemented with about half a tablespoon of oil. 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.270
 Again, distribute well and let it get really hot on a big heat. 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.610
 Then put in the pieces of pepper. 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 The hisses and squirts quite strong. 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.239
 Fry everything at high heat. 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.080
 Since pepper contains a lot of water, the strong heat has to be the exiting liquid 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.180
 evaporate quickly, otherwise cook the vegetables instead of frying. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.040
 As with the onions, it is only seasoned at the end. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.870
 When the first crusts are formed, you can turn the pepper over. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.469
 If the pan is too dry, you may need a little more oil. 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.879
 Shines the vegetables as here, it is just right. 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.989
 Now you have to fry everything briefly, until the pepper is almost glassy. 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.379
 Then I add the onions again. 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.690
 Mix everything well and continue to fry on the highest heat until it brownens you 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.709
 seems enough. 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.540
 Then turn off the fire and remove the pan from the plate while cooking. only now 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.170
 is salted and peppered. 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:04:01.370
 Transfer again and the pepper-onion vegetables can be served. 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.379
 And that's how my pepper onion looks finished. 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.799
 You can just eat it, but also fried seitan or crispy poultry strips 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:12.829
 Mix in. 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.139
 It tastes very good tomato bulgur. 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.360
 A little yoghurt sauce completes the dish very delicious. 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.680
 Thank you for watching. 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.320
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe. 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.880
 It's a very versatile dish that goes very well with vegan cuisine. 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.980
 Right at the side I have two more recipes. 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.090
 First, the mentioned yoghurt sauce and underneath a delicious paprika salad. 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.000
