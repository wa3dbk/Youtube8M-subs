00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
cool here this is probably good time to

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.460 
cool here this is probably good time to
talk<00:02:39.780> about<00:02:39.810> talk<00:02:40.409> about<00:02:40.709> myself<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:42.170> am<00:02:43.170> French

TV<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.170> had<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.650> video<00:02:55.920> tomorrow<00:02:58.819> so

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
TV I had to make that video tomorrow so

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.899 
TV I had to make that video tomorrow so
you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:01.829> NBA<00:03:01.950> basically

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
you know if you like the NBA basically

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.479 
you know if you like the NBA basically
and<00:03:03.090> it'd<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.299> like<00:03:03.420> gaming<00:03:03.829> you<00:03:04.829> like<00:03:05.010> Cod<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and it'd be like gaming you like Cod and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.220 
and it'd be like gaming you like Cod and
stuff<00:03:05.840> subscribe<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> my<00:03:07.019> channel<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:09.599> now<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
stuff subscribe to my channel so now I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.000 
stuff subscribe to my channel so now I
am<00:03:10.970> upgrading<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.720> celery<00:03:13.019> acceleration<00:03:13.859> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
am upgrading like celery acceleration is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.770 
am upgrading like celery acceleration is
a<00:03:14.040> big<00:03:14.489> part<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.909> this<00:03:15.030> game<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:18.000> acceleration

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
a big part in this game so acceleration

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.949 
a big part in this game so acceleration
makes<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.609> momentum<00:03:20.790> when<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.840> go

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
makes you have more momentum when you go

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.809 
makes you have more momentum when you go
down<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> field<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:24.120> Madden<00:03:24.480> 11<00:03:25.819> momentum

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
down the field and in Madden 11 momentum

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.750 
down the field and in Madden 11 momentum
is<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> lot<00:03:27.389> because<00:03:28.010> they<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.220> new<00:03:29.519> like

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
is a lot because they have a new like

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.879 
is a lot because they have a new like
momentum<00:03:30.389> center<00:03:30.980> running<00:03:33.799> mechanism<00:03:34.799> I

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
momentum center running mechanism I

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.110 
momentum center running mechanism I
guess<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.310> can<00:03:35.430> call<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:36.409> so<00:03:37.409> when<00:03:37.739> your

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
guess you can call it so when your

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.939 
guess you can call it so when your
player<00:03:39.120> when<00:03:39.690> your<00:03:39.810> running<00:03:39.959> back<00:03:40.139> runs<00:03:40.530> down

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
player when your running back runs down

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.920 
player when your running back runs down
field<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.370> grain<00:03:41.519> game<00:03:42.000> ovah<00:03:42.389> meant<00:03:42.599> more

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
field of grain game ovah meant more

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.939 
field of grain game ovah meant more
momentum<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.370> acceleration<00:03:45.000> helps<00:03:45.949> you

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
momentum and the acceleration helps you

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.439 
momentum and the acceleration helps you
gain<00:03:47.159> more<00:03:47.489> momentum<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:51.060> easier<00:03:51.389> to

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
gain more momentum and it's easier to

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.640 
gain more momentum and it's easier to
break<00:03:51.659> tackles<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.409> have<00:03:52.500> more

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
break tackles so if you have more

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.379 
break tackles so if you have more
momentum<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:55.979> trucking<00:03:56.819> hide

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
momentum so it's a trucking hide

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.259 
momentum so it's a trucking hide
trucking<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.579> it's<00:03:59.579> always<00:03:59.879> good<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.120> have

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
trucking and it's always good to have

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.059 
trucking and it's always good to have
speed<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:01.019> if<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.379> have<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> power<00:04:01.769> back

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
speed you know if you have a power back

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.479 
speed you know if you have a power back
so<00:04:02.879> you<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.449> couple<00:04:03.780> first<00:04:04.620> couple<00:04:05.400> steps

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
so you have a couple first couple steps

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.569 
so you have a couple first couple steps
off<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.449> line<00:04:06.659> when<00:04:07.079> you<00:04:07.109> first<00:04:07.459> when<00:04:08.459> you

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
off the line when you first when you

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.129 
off the line when you first when you
have<00:04:08.609> those<00:04:08.879> first<00:04:09.150> couple<00:04:09.299> yards<00:04:09.599> just<00:04:10.049> to

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
have those first couple yards just to

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.159 
have those first couple yards just to
get<00:04:10.319> past<00:04:10.530> people<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.699> I<00:04:12.510> think<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.780> upgraded

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
get past people and I think I upgraded

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.349 
get past people and I think I upgraded
stamina<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:14.099> all<00:04:14.370> right<00:04:14.579> now<00:04:14.669> and<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:14.940> thought<00:04:15.180> I

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
stamina to all right now and I thought I

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.899 
stamina to all right now and I thought I
thought<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.760> standardized<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.849> a

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
thought it good not standardized is a

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.509 
thought it good not standardized is a
big<00:04:18.090> part<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:18.810> your<00:04:19.169> person<00:04:19.590> your<00:04:20.070> running<00:04:20.430> bag

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
big part so your person your running bag

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.530 
big part so your person your running bag
stays<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.909> the<00:04:21.000> field<00:04:21.150> for<00:04:21.419> third<00:04:21.630> down

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
stays on the field for third down

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.470 
stays on the field for third down
but<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.230> will<00:04:24.350> see<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.010> team<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.030> get<00:04:26.330> on

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
but you will see the team that I get on

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.820 
but you will see the team that I get on
is<00:04:26.810> pretty<00:04:27.170> tank<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:28.850> New<00:04:28.910> York<00:04:29.060> Jets

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
is pretty tank it is the New York Jets

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.070 
is pretty tank it is the New York Jets
so<00:04:30.830> I'm<00:04:30.890> just<00:04:31.040> showing<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.310> some<00:04:32.080> intense

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
so I'm just showing you some intense

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:43.650 
so I'm just showing you some intense
gameplay<00:04:34.690> from<00:04:38.560> from<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.910> first<00:04:41.510> practice

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
gameplay from from the first practice

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.910 
gameplay from from the first practice
it's<00:04:44.660> pretty<00:04:44.900> fun<00:04:45.110> playing<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.470> guy

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
it's pretty fun playing this guy

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.070 
it's pretty fun playing this guy
I<00:04:45.950> just<00:04:46.430> got<00:04:46.640> as<00:04:46.940> this<00:04:47.360> guy<00:04:49.630> look<00:04:50.630> at<00:04:50.720> this

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
I just got as this guy look at this

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.320 
I just got as this guy look at this
oh<00:04:52.060> just<00:04:53.060> pretty<00:04:53.390> big<00:04:53.750> pretty<00:04:54.650> big<00:04:54.890> hole<00:04:55.330> so

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
oh just pretty big pretty big hole so

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.380 
oh just pretty big pretty big hole so
just<00:04:56.840> think<00:04:56.990> about<00:04:57.080> these<00:04:57.260> grind<00:04:57.560> X<00:04:58.390> John

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
just think about these grind X John

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.100 
just think about these grind X John
Green<00:05:01.120> LT<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.530> this<00:05:03.530> guy<00:05:03.770> is<00:05:04.610> pretty<00:05:04.820> tank<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
Green LT and this guy is pretty tank and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.720 
Green LT and this guy is pretty tank and
three<00:05:06.560> very<00:05:06.830> good<00:05:06.890> running<00:05:07.190> backs<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:09.670> try<00:05:10.670> to

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
three very good running backs I try to

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.760 
three very good running backs I try to
do<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.300> shake<00:05:11.630> them<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:11.930> they<00:05:12.110> can<00:05:12.320> move<00:05:12.440> their

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
do is shake them and they can move their

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.690

trucking<00:05:56.390> might<00:05:56.660> be<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:56.840> little<00:05:57.200> inconsistent

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
on its it becomes more consistent as you

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.990 
on its it becomes more consistent as you
get<00:06:06.260> used<00:06:06.440> to<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.620> Kentucky<00:06:07.280> skills<00:06:08.650> so
