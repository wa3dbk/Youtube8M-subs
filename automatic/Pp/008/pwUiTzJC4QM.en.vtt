00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.650
 in stuffing the breasts or if you 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.759
 yellow pepper and red chopped well 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.789
 finite carrot cooked and cut in 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.370
 small sticks 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.860
 and spinach 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.920
 that are cooked 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.470
 and we're going to squeeze them and the sugar 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.560
 will get the maximum water for 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.630
 after 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.570
 and load 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.990
 Webo that can be wants to be more 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.390
 likes only the clear that we're going to 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.060
 join to see the amount is not 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.060
 necessary but half of the game 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.960
 and developed these are the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.440
 ingredients with which we are going to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 Fill 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.710
 I want you to do 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.320
 and in that water 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.140
 put the spinach you let it go 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.229
 cook for about two minutes, remove them if 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 you put them in a colander and from under the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.050
 stream of cold water there is also the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 spinach 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.530
 is that I have the preparation and the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 carrot the spinach breaking the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.350
 two colors I'm getting I start 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.970
 I start serves to absorb everything that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.700
 it gives me that I was going to produce the cooking 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.860
 from you know that more compact 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.960
 here is our breast first thing 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.310
 we should do is take the job and 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 all those who have 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.370
 in this part of the bone 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.670
 bordering 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.670
 the bone we are going to take out the breast 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.160
 touching the bone 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.270
 so we go when we leave bone 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 from high 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 watch out 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.420
 and so 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.500
 we have our breast ready 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.550
 never 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.569
 well scraping the knife 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.700
 well the bone 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.050
 to make us more 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.050
 we follow all the meat 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.220
 here you have to be careful with this 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.220
 since there is here 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.170
 with the breast the breast has these 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.540
 little things that everything has been fixed in that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.260
 it sold part this finite there 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.260
 to take it out 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.360
 the two fillets of the breast 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.849
 now where are we going to open the breast 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.440
 the easiest part to open the breast 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.440
 of that activity is the breast 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.209
 up here then it's like a 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 little bag and there we are going to put the stuffing 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.790
 support a table trying not to be 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.100
 go to pass the knife down and 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 let's go 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.870
 to the bottom with your hand tube 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.870
 setting aside how it will be more 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.610
 turning around singing you do not leave 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.220
 to pass the knife on the other side and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:14.680
 in this course we are going to put the king 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:17.790
 I'm filling my breast with my hand 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.630
 not with a spoon because that's how we're doing 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.570
 feeling that it's going well we're going 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.700
 pushing gently so that we are not 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.910
 open the cheese a little bit 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.870
 that is there and with a mountain tooth 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.870
 let's close here 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.880
 essential thing can not be brought to the 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.460
 table a breast with toothpicks 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.140
 positions when you are finished 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.630
 cooking the lettuce they take out the 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.810
 toothpicks and from there they can serve 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.269
 on a plate to the table if you have left 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.150
 some opening like it was there 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:59.160
 simply with a toothpick 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.550
 we are going to close it 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.510
 and so pearlite 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.510
 to cook 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.230
 to this source I'm going to put a little 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.230
 of oil as vegetable dew 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:23.769
 let's wink the breast here I have 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.769
 lemon juice and here I have mustard 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.380
 I'm going to join
