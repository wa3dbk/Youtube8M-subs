00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
properties of this water and why it's so

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.220 
properties of this water and why it's so
very<00:00:09.420> special

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
very special

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.509 
very special
the<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:10.530> property<00:00:10.800> I'm<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> show<00:00:11.460> you

the first property I'm going to show you
is<00:00:11.790> what's<00:00:12.660> called<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> ORP<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.920> stands

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
is what's called the ORP which stands

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.310 
is what's called the ORP which stands
for<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.460> oxidation<00:00:15.089> reduction<00:00:15.480> potential

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
for the oxidation reduction potential

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.500 
for the oxidation reduction potential
and<00:00:16.730> we're<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.880> show<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.330> with<00:00:18.449> a

and we're going to show you that with a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.529 
and we're going to show you that with a
meter<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.619> shows<00:00:20.070> whether<00:00:20.670> liquid<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
meter that shows whether liquid it has a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.040 
meter that shows whether liquid it has a
positive<00:00:21.869> RP<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> negative<00:00:23.640> orp<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.930> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
positive RP or a negative orp and if it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
positive RP or a negative orp and if it
has<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> positive<00:00:25.439> o<00:00:25.800> RP<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.849> means<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.390> bad

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
has a positive o RP that means it's bad

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.800 
has a positive o RP that means it's bad
for<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.699> oxidizing<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:29.849> aging<00:00:30.539> or

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
for you or it's oxidizing or aging or

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.690 
for you or it's oxidizing or aging or
rusting<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.309> right

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
rusting we all know what that is right

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.209 
rusting we all know what that is right
and<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.870> has<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> negative<00:00:34.290> orp<00:00:34.950> that's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
and so if it has a negative orp that's

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.940 
and so if it has a negative orp that's
what<00:00:35.430> makes<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> powerful<00:00:36.570> antioxidant<00:00:36.989> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
what makes it a powerful antioxidant so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
what makes it a powerful antioxidant so
what<00:00:38.640> we're<00:00:38.790> gonna<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.899> I'm

Gatorade like 393 and climbing so
remember<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.670> worst<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.150> more<00:02:47.329> positive<00:02:47.600> it

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.890 
remember the worst the more positive it
is<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.470> worse<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:48.890> how<00:02:49.160> about<00:02:49.220> 7up<00:02:49.900> all

sodas<00:02:51.350> are<00:02:51.500> pretty<00:02:51.680> much<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.980> same<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.519> we

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
sodas are pretty much the same just we

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.050 
sodas are pretty much the same just we
use<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.329> light-colored<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.709> you'll<00:02:55.040> see<00:02:55.220> 394

use a light-colored so you'll see 394

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.069 
use a light-colored so you'll see 394
and<00:02:56.239> climbing<00:02:58.120> about<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.269> tap<00:02:59.510> water

325<00:03:04.690> here's<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.840> star<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.230> show<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.560> guys

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
325 here's the star of the show you guys

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.240 
325 here's the star of the show you guys
look<00:03:09.470> at-<00:03:09.620> what<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.700> over<00:03:10.940> negative<00:03:11.450> 400<00:03:12.380> now

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
look at- what for over negative 400 now

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.360 
look at- what for over negative 400 now
when<00:03:13.430> they<00:03:13.549> get<00:03:13.670> at<00:03:13.760> 426<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.019> see

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
when they get at 426 a so you can see

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.590 
when they get at 426 a so you can see
when<00:03:16.370> it<00:03:16.489> has<00:03:16.609> a<00:03:16.639> negative<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.420> only

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
when it has a negative this is the only

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.330 
when it has a negative this is the only
water<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.870> has<00:03:18.139> a<00:03:18.170> negative<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:19.220> why

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
water that has a negative that's why

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.920 
water that has a negative that's why
they<00:03:19.459> call<00:03:19.639> it<00:03:19.730> negative<00:03:19.910> water<00:03:20.329> in<00:03:20.540> Japan

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
they call it negative water in Japan

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.809 
they call it negative water in Japan
that's<00:03:21.230> why<00:03:21.350> they<00:03:21.500> use<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.799> in<00:03:21.920> hospitals<00:03:22.519> over

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
that's why they use it in hospitals over

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.170 
that's why they use it in hospitals over
there<00:03:23.000> because<00:03:23.600> all<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.650> positive<00:03:25.519> ones<00:03:25.730> are

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
there because all the positive ones are

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.640 
there because all the positive ones are
oxidizing<00:03:27.069> ageing<00:03:28.069> rusting<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.290> you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
oxidizing ageing rusting that it you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.170 
oxidizing ageing rusting that it you
know<00:03:30.680> internally<00:03:31.100> on<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> body<00:03:31.700> but<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
know internally on the body but the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.970 
know internally on the body but the
negative<00:03:32.569> waters<00:03:32.870> neutralizing<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.829> free

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
negative waters neutralizing the free

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.259 
negative waters neutralizing the free
radicals<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.579> that's<00:03:34.819> why<00:03:34.970> we're<00:03:35.120> going<00:03:35.209> to

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
radicals so that's why we're going to

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.270 
radicals so that's why we're going to
drink<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.630> water<00:03:35.739> hydrate<00:03:36.739> your<00:03:36.829> body<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.250> a

drink this water hydrate your body on a
