taste no more than 80 or 90 wines in the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.090 
taste no more than 80 or 90 wines in the
in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.510> few<00:00:57.809> rounds<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> very

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
in the first few rounds that's a very

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.349 
in the first few rounds that's a very
low<00:00:59.309> number<00:00:59.520> compared<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> other

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
low number compared to other

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.160 
low number compared to other
competitions

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
competitions

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
competitions
in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> second<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.370> third<00:01:02.520> rounds<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in the second and third rounds the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
in the second and third rounds the
numbers<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.449> reduced<00:01:03.840> again<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
numbers are reduced again so really the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.390 
numbers are reduced again so really the
daily<00:01:05.820> workload<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.680> heavy<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
daily workload is not that heavy and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
daily workload is not that heavy and
it's<00:01:08.909> spread<00:01:09.210> across<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> panels<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
it's spread across all the panels so I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's spread across all the panels so I
think<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.189> getting<00:01:11.280> really<00:01:11.520> good<00:01:11.640> results

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
think we're getting really good results

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830 
think we're getting really good results
from<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.750> would<00:01:13.470> say<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.479> not

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
from that I would say this one is if not

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.070 
from that I would say this one is if not
the<00:01:16.320> best<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:17.100> definitely<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.810> best

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the best but definitely one of the best

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
the best but definitely one of the best
wine<00:01:19.560> competitions<00:01:19.909> in<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> world<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.780> terms

of the quality of the judges the

and<00:03:52.450> wine<00:03:52.630> we<00:03:52.810> try<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.049> keep<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.410> pace<00:03:53.650> moving

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
and wine we try to keep the pace moving

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.699 
and wine we try to keep the pace moving
so<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:55.180> they're<00:03:55.390> tasting<00:03:55.870> say<00:03:56.170> eight<00:03:56.440> wines

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
so if they're tasting say eight wines

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.800 
so if they're tasting say eight wines
that<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.340> tasting<00:03:57.760> is<00:03:57.850> over<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.120> about<00:03:58.180> 24

that that tasting is over in about 24

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.930 
that that tasting is over in about 24
minutes<00:03:59.170> then<00:03:59.709> there's<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.040> then<00:04:00.489> there<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.790> an

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
minutes then there's a then there is an

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.030 
minutes then there's a then there is an
exchange<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.660> scores<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> sheet<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:02.890> that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
exchange of scores on a sheet so that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.949 
exchange of scores on a sheet so that
everybody<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.700> see<00:04:03.970> what<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.450> scores<00:04:04.750> are

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
everybody can see what the scores are

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.259 
everybody can see what the scores are
for<00:04:05.019> wine<00:04:05.410> won<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.130> if<00:04:06.610> there's<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.880> wine<00:04:07.090> out

like most Canadians we always say that

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.520 
like most Canadians we always say that

their red wines too warm we do not do

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.370 
their red wines too warm we do not do
that<00:04:54.320> we<00:04:54.919> want<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.760> wine<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.360> be<00:04:56.479> in<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.139> most

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
that we want that wine to be in the most

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.460 
that we want that wine to be in the most
perfect<00:04:57.940> space<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.270> time<00:04:59.690> that<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.139> can<00:05:00.320> be

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
perfect space and time that it can be

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.560 
perfect space and time that it can be
when<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.130> front<00:05:01.220> of<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.490> judge<00:05:01.729> then<00:05:02.419> it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
when it's in front of the judge then it

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.570 
when it's in front of the judge then it
gets<00:05:02.750> their<00:05:03.020> attention<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.770> everything's

gets their attention and everything's

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.180 
gets their attention and everything's
perfect<00:05:05.060> we<00:05:05.570> can<00:05:05.600> judge<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.199> wine<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.830> so<00:05:07.010> we

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
perfect we can judge that wine and so we

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.010 
perfect we can judge that wine and so we
go<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.550> lot<00:05:07.789> of<00:05:07.940> effort<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.300> make<00:05:08.449> sure<00:05:08.630> that

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
go to a lot of effort to make sure that

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.560 
go to a lot of effort to make sure that
that<00:05:09.470> wine<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:10.310> in<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.639> right<00:05:10.820> plate<00:05:11.150> at<00:05:11.419> the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
that wine is in the right plate at the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.420 
that wine is in the right plate at the
right<00:05:11.750> temperature<00:05:12.260> at<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.620> right<00:05:12.830> time<00:05:13.130> so

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
right temperature at the right time so

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.610 
right temperature at the right time so
that<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.060> can<00:05:14.240> be<00:05:14.389> analyzed<00:05:14.960> by<00:05:15.080> those<00:05:15.350> judges

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
that it can be analyzed by those judges

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.000 
that it can be analyzed by those judges
we're<00:05:15.949> not<00:05:16.070> just<00:05:16.280> throwing<00:05:16.520> stuff<00:05:16.850> out<00:05:17.180> there

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
we're not just throwing stuff out there

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.379 
we're not just throwing stuff out there
well<00:05:19.010> in<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.250> earlier<00:05:19.550> rounds<00:05:19.760> normally

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
well in the earlier rounds normally

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.600 
well in the earlier rounds normally
three<00:05:20.660> or<00:05:20.780> four<00:05:21.020> people<00:05:21.260> would<00:05:21.650> judge<00:05:21.949> a<00:05:22.250> wine

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
three or four people would judge a wine

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.520 
three or four people would judge a wine
and<00:05:23.000> then<00:05:23.240> if<00:05:23.449> that<00:05:23.630> wine<00:05:23.810> gets<00:05:24.110> on<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
and then if that wine gets on to the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.890 
and then if that wine gets on to the
second<00:05:25.039> round<00:05:25.190> then<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.240> could<00:05:26.419> be<00:05:26.449> spread

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
second round then it could be spread

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.810 
second round then it could be spread
across<00:05:27.169> two<00:05:27.440> panels<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.310> would<00:05:28.460> jump<00:05:28.699> the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
across two panels so that would jump the

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.939 
across two panels so that would jump the
numbers<00:05:29.120> between<00:05:29.270> six<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.930> eight<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.229> if<00:05:30.800> it

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
numbers between six and eight and if it

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.040 
numbers between six and eight and if it
gets<00:05:31.130> into<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.550> final<00:05:31.940> day<00:05:32.150> there's<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:32.870> good

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
gets into the final day there's a good

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.629 
gets into the final day there's a good
possibility<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.830> would<00:05:33.919> be<00:05:34.070> spread<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.400> all

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
possibility it would be spread to all

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.180 
possibility it would be spread to all
fifteen<00:05:35.120> or<00:05:35.240> sixteen<00:05:35.389> judges<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:36.740> tasted

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
fifteen or sixteen judges so it's tasted

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.100 
fifteen or sixteen judges so it's tasted
three<00:05:37.310> times<00:05:37.699> if<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.270> add<00:05:38.389> up<00:05:38.419> all<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.870> judges

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
three times if you add up all the judges

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.710 
three times if you add up all the judges
maybe<00:05:39.470> it's<00:05:39.710> had<00:05:39.889> 22<00:05:40.370> or<00:05:40.520> 25<00:05:41.000> people<00:05:41.300> look<00:05:41.570> at
