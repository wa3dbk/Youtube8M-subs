00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:10.380
 hi fis subscribers and here is the first 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.389
 machine video tutorial is now 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.610
 available 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.670
 good if you have problems with 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.590
 dandruff here is so I propose you a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 Roma get rid of weekend 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 definitely or almost but that is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 so definitely so before any harm 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.220
 I strongly suggest you identify 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 source 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.290
 so be careful the source of the problem 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 what is it is to see what kind of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.790
 greasy dry film 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 here 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.739
 it will help you here they are 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.199
 me anyway I was really 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.140
 surprised to recover 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.590
 so I'm going to talk quickly about getting 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.049
 reset 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.049
 it included a budai of this there 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.460
 understand you do not have to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 take all the iphone is just a 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 little part that's a piece what it 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 wanted to crush so that you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.880
 when you create a paste so after 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.520
 visit you in a little bit 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.490
 oil le2a is according to you you go 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.680
 see if it's going to cover well your 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.170
 head if you lie you can put by 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.470
 example and it will not be enough for you 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.330
 cover all your all your hair there 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.230
 have to increase a little bit if it's 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.820
 too much it is necessary to decrease here is to find the 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.979
 the right dose after me will have to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.940
 mix for read together 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 and the oil and yes I forgot to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 notice it's olive oil it takes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.050
 than the trades of a line of books 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.880
 already because it moisturizes 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.680
 the scalp so it helps to eliminate 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.880
 this bacteria 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.430
 so after you apply on your 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.220
 hair and you wait between 10 and 15 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.750
 minutes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.850
 well we'll go now to 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.610
 advantages and rather disadvantages of 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.040
 this product is it stinks that's it 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.630
 can a lot and I found a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.940
 little solution for that is to put 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.770
 something on your head kind you 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.620
 cover the head so that it does not release 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.930
 of smell and all that's not it you 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.830
 take a special trick or other games 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.480
 I have no idea but you can 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.310
 example I take a bag in 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.010
 plastic that is a little bit clean 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.860
 that's it even if it's not 100% clean 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 do not worry the effect of live kill 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.400
 all his friends irina so that's so 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.970
 that's it, do not forget it's only when you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 feel the ouch it can also clear a 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.600
 little bit your nasal sinuses and 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.670
 and kill some microbes from 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.290
 microbes here we do not see the eye 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 bare 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.360
 so that's something else does not do that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.350
 when you are with someone or when 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.990
 you are in the company of others so 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.330
 try to do it alone in his 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.550
 corner here is the other thing because 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.650
 if you go out like this in front of 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.360
 people and all that will smell and you can 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.050
 do not do me me there may be some 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.600
 little of the little words not good what 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.720
 these are the things that are said about you what 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.390
 but there are not too afraid to 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.760
 to be done so here is the woman is 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 the fan of all high and I would like 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.890
 that you're trying that they're going 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.840
 comment on whether it worked or not good 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:16.370
 anyway I hope for you and bah there 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.810

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.810

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.330
