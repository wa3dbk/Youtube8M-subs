00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
and it kind of looked around and didn't

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.369 
and it kind of looked around and didn't
really<00:02:30.909> rare<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.629> but<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.049> like<00:02:32.170> that

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
really rare up but it's just like that

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.979 
really rare up but it's just like that
little<00:02:32.530> that's<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.890> song<00:02:33.159> yeah<00:02:33.609> so<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:34.269> drop

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
little that's a song yeah so we drop

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.289 
little that's a song yeah so we drop
back<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.560> water<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.639> it's<00:02:36.790> swimming<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
back in the water so it's swimming to

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.089 
back in the water so it's swimming to
another<00:02:37.659> Island<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.739> they'd<00:02:38.950> probably

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
another Island and so they'd probably

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.039 
another Island and so they'd probably
took<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.370> another<00:02:39.700> hour<00:02:39.909> but<00:02:40.719> I<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.930> think

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
took that another hour but I can think

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.780 
took that another hour but I can think
about<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.500> was<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.769> seeing<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.129> chef<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.639> I'm

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
about it was like seeing a chef as I'm

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.170 
about it was like seeing a chef as I'm
swimming

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.390 
swimming
coming<00:02:43.689> up<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.079> an<00:02:44.230> trying<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.099> home<00:02:45.220> if

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
coming up like an trying to go home if
