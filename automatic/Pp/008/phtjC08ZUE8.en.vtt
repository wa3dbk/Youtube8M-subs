 from these couples are usually 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.090
 high in both official languages 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.009
 when there is no third language 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.690

 language 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.579
 at the same time as unilingual children 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 and they will produce their first words 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.600
 at about the same age as children 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600
 hinhinhin the first sentence too 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.010
 here at the laboratory of the development of 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.570
 language one is interested in knowing how 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.059
 children learn new words 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 but also how and I come to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.609
 distinguish the different sounds of the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.010
 language 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.350
 we're doing research on how 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.539
 the children hear perceive the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.450
 word is often compared children there 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.030
 French-speaking nilan with 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.070
 english children man is married we have 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.110
 four children my husband we get 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.970
 meet and did not really speak 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.679
 French but possibly with the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.130
 practice that is well arranged is 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.080
 do well 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.649
 if I learned that parents this fact 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.090
 raising their children in a bilingual manner 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.819
 what advice will I give them 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.500
 it's first of all to become aware 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.479
 more than bilingualism is very 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 frequent in the world actually it is estimated 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.979
 more bilingual kids 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.869
 he has one in the world so it's a 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.670
 reality that is common not only in 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.159
 ontario but all over the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 world and that we have no proof or 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.289
 of envied what tells us a child 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.819
 is more suited to learning a single 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.860
 language rather than learning from 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.989
 Languedoc comes to the world have 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.500
 as much franck dudt lankais afren a 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.500
 only 1 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.240
 we decided to bind our children so 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.860
 bilingual 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.290
 pretty naturally it's crazy as they 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.540
 are able to adapt well and 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.670
 well take the language for example the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.130
 last can look great moment of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 my side speaks to him in French and then 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.760
 two seconds later turns to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.400
 his grandmother on my husband's side then 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 it's in English without hesitation 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.860
 it's amazing in children's crates 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.720
 babies of seven months already we can see 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.480
 that clinical benefits and in 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.070
 young bilingual babies 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.200
 for example it without having a plus 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.959
 great mental flexibility of 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.780
 better inhibition capabilities too 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.110
 and its effects the quality seems to be 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.030
 continue throughout the life of 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.280
 the child and later on the diet more 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.620
 they are older no longer turning to 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.910
 English is like school in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.560
 the school also we are always in the process 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.340
 to tell students to speak French 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.780
 speaking French 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.360
 but when they are small as per 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.850
 example cloud type and it is still 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.250
 only French except when she is 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.190
 at the turn of great moments from the side to my 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.500
 husband there is in English but otherwise and 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.230
 between them also communicates with chloe 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.269
 100 French but they will turn around 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.769
 then speak to you in English together they 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.050
 go watch chloe who will talk to him 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.310
 in French so that's it's a 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.310
 stride not 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.980
 as it is a fact when children 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.040
 meylan leader of the words of the different 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.380
 languages in a sentence this is not a 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.470
 confusion sign a beeline child 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.960
 sometimes used a word of a language but 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.780
 only when he knows that the person 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.000
 who is going to understand this 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.730
 exchange of mullahs north yorkshire to 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.650
 take into account both legacy and 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.140
 desires line children often ignore 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.300
 your remarks and who will reach the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.100
 same states of development at the same 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.890
 moment but that they may go 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.450
 take a dispute way to get 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.450
 return to their final destination
