00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.410
 now friends let's see our sensor 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.320
 of detonation where is it 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.850
 in the intake manifold between 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:22.850
 Injector number 2 and number 3 the cable is 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.910
 black with a green stripe but friends 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.460
 what is its function is to inform the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.100
 spectrum to the computer that exists 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.860
 some detonation remember that it is a 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.650
 detonation the piston is going up and 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.630
 going down truth opens the low valve 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.360
 Absorbs the fuel closes the vall 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.340
 d'uixÃ³ turn and then ignite the spark 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.520
 before it comes to a standstill 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.350
 superior begins to turn on the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.360
 spark before it is at the point 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.220
 much higher then there is an explosion 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.059
 but rather it 's an expansion it 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.879
 expands the fuel and makes it lower 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.220
 piston a detonation that is there is excess 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.339
 of coal in the piston a lot of heat or 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.770
 lack of gasoline gets too hot 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.500
 here to light the spark alone 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.530
 lights the spark plug waves arrive 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.390
 shock hit and the piston moves 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.120
 sideways by the shock of two 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.510
 detonations is like two explosions or 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.970
 that will hit a bomb with another bomb 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.930
 well that detonation this sensor what 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 they detect 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.890
 what is your function 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.070
 when there is a detonation it informs 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.880
 the computer and this slows down the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880
 ignition time 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.240
 give a little more gas 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:48.079
 correct what kind of sensors 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.110
 is a sensor of the generator type is 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.060
 composed of a quartz crystal that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.830
 has a particularity that crystal of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.720
 Quartz as soon as it moves 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.240
 well it moves a little bit we're going to do the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.480
 simulation will generate current 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.630
 alternating true friends what are the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.090
 parts 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.489
 when this sensor fails of band that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.349
 is moving a lot without there 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.300
 detonation when it is very guango by 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.900
 so say what happens 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.330
 the minimum gear is without being that other 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.420
 remember when it works well behind the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.030
 time and it gives more gasoline that is excessive 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.950
 gasoline consumption and as back the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.569
 then we have a lot of loss of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.170
 power and having those two factors 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.170
 what happens polluting emissions
