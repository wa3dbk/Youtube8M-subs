at totally guitars that goes through

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.220 
at totally guitars that goes through
it's<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.149> simple<00:00:30.450> song<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:30.960> hand<00:00:31.140> I

it's a very simple song on one hand I
was<00:00:31.320> even<00:00:31.559> thinking<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:31.829> just<00:00:32.099> doing<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
was even thinking about just doing this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.770 
was even thinking about just doing this
as<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> cannon<00:00:32.850> fire<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.270> but<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> thought<00:00:33.570> now

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
as a cannon fire thing but I thought now

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.850 
as a cannon fire thing but I thought now
you<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.170> got<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.379> talk<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you know what we got to talk about the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
you know what we got to talk about the
theory<00:00:35.129> involved<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.910> got<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> talk

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
theory involved in this we got to talk

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
theory involved in this we got to talk
about<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.989> strumming<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.860> simple<00:00:38.579> chord

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
about the strumming of a simple chord

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750 
about the strumming of a simple chord
progression<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> 6/8<00:00:40.980> times<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
progression but it's in 6/8 times so in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.880 
progression but it's in 6/8 times so in
this<00:00:41.879> lesson<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.329> address<00:00:42.870> what's<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.769> on

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this lesson we address what's going on

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.099 
this lesson we address what's going on
with<00:00:44.100> 6/8<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> different<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.510> 3/4

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
with 6/8 how it's a different than 3/4

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.259 
with 6/8 how it's a different than 3/4
and<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.129> does<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.699> song<00:00:47.879> sound

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
and what he does to make the song sound

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.309 
and what he does to make the song sound
get<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:50.550> Erie's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.600> kind<00:00:51.839> of<00:00:51.870> spooky

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:52.319 
get this this Erie's the kind of spooky

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.200 
get this this Erie's the kind of spooky
sound<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> done<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> song<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.519> not<00:00:53.850> in

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
sound is done because the song is not in

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
sound is done because the song is not in

a major key it's in a mode so we talked

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.889 
a major key it's in a mode so we talked
a<00:00:56.609> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:56.909> about<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> mode<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.749> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
a little bit about the mode that it's in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
a little bit about the mode that it's in
then<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.649> talked<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.159> chords<00:00:59.489> we've

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
then we talked about the chords we've

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
then we talked about the chords we've
got<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.909> spend<00:01:00.089> a<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.420> chord<00:01:00.749> we've<00:01:00.929> got<00:01:01.050> some

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
got to spend a to chord we've got some
