 kits seen the opening mechanism 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.720
 earth switch is enough to start it slightly for

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.560
 what you immediately notice and the screen 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.840
 round 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.979
 full of beautiful pixels 16,000 colors 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.929
 downo, 55 inches might seem small but you haven't seen that 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.929
 circular 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 el very clean the designer as you can see there is only there are only two 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.630
 rocker keys volume over the entire body of the phone these are the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.900
 buttons for 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.920

 presence of the opening mechanism

 the two lenses the one that protects the screen to that and the camera are 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.280
 the same sapphire lenses we find on the cellphone oneself that we find on 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.130
 watches 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.560
 loool his like 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.749
 rolex eta we anger tried agrate 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.030
 tired damaged but there is no verse 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630
 of the highest quality 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.369
 thor the material used on the metal phone as you can see 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.009
 also very precise assembly 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.009
 no crunch no kind of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.520
 fissuring 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.430
 and no type of nini 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.010
 now going to the other one 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.479
 the only part that is not this metal 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.900
 lower 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.329
 rear where practically all the antennas are housed 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:19.710
 very nice choice on the part of motorola to have an excellent sound either 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.900
 also avellan maximum signal 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 separate management which would be of low end would have been enough 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.590
 the quality of the audio 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.189
 and draw 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 once opened, the alphanumeric keyboard is accessed 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.620
 with large buttons to separate each meal time 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.330
 he said I said 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.080
 microscopic - 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.070
 this actually allows the nut to fly to have a good grip 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.200
 although it appears boxes in what is the backup 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 I'm torn 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.230
 this for these three keys are rubberized to help the visually impaired have people 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.320
 who use the phone without looking at the keyboard to orient themselves more 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.199
 easily 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.729
 on the train 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:10.279
 the numeric keys are large steps that you can also enter while on the move 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.639
 a little made to think the choice to put it that is back in this position 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.359
 it's also so small 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.669
 that icon menu 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.669
 that in any case less than the last generation of motorola 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.039
 the two soft skill girl 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.319
 the key which is the back key 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.189
 it becomes a bit cumbersome to access certain minutes 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.620
 and also long to get to the part 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.069
 Siberian diminutives 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.769
 as you can see, however, mine is not perfectly optimized 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.039
 even if circular 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.189
 we are in the settings team 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.189
 but to change the subject 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.629
 ok 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.629
 the light system 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.790
 very bright trick cameras fails to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.790
 make 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.379
 the phone is a quad-band with gprs connectivity but also inkjet not 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.930
 umts there is no hsd nice you do this because 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.919
 it's not my multimedia phone - a phone 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.919
 business this is a jewel phone 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.380
 eataly functions of those that 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.610
 so 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.169
 that essential 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.229
 the intellectual must be beautiful with valuable materials 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.949
 in fact this motorola is 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.889
 the audio is very good thanks to the use of crystal turkana 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.469
 software that motorola 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.800
 view the sui on the end phones 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.780
 medium and high beers clean soil through filters 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.020
 this allows you to have 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.660
 from the switch and will give you interlocutor during the call a 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.660
 practically crystalline sound 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.770
 as you can see everyone 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.420
 section purifier are also found 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.420
 here in the front 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.879
 the 2 mega main camera the carmencita photo of the camera unit 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.409
 from 2 megapixels 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.570
 spa in works well in optimal light conditions - when they start 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.600
 to find us in poorly lit rooms or inside with neon lights 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.570
 the memory of the phone is 2 gig so no problem for quotation of 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.300
 for music files or crossroads shot with this was less than images 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.240
 you can't team man 2 gigabytes are more than enough 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.740
 for such a phone 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.740
 with you can see the locking mechanism again 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.880
 weight 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.210
 641 grams, however, thanks to its size 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.720
 96, 8 for 47, 7 18, 5 millimeters 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.139
 we kids pull you that much next month it will be easily 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.599
 intended white 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.599
 for those who love not very big 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.790
 on board there is also the bluetooth inversion due.zero with 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.150
 file to make the two paintings 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.090
 so no problem to use wireless headphones 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.439
 to listen to music 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.500
 we return 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.270
 in the theme 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.270
 dark 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:49.249
 then we have some shortcuts who is directly from memory 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.960
 main 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.930
 motorola expects to sell this model for around 1500 euros 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.460
 rent nonton will find it second hand because 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.699
