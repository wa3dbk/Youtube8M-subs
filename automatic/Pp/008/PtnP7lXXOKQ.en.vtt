00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
when we talk about turf grass management

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.400 
when we talk about turf grass management
the<00:00:36.250> five<00:00:36.579> cultural<00:00:37.149> practices<00:00:37.809> from<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.109> top

the five cultural practices from the top

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.329 
the five cultural practices from the top
down<00:00:38.710> are<00:00:39.010> mowing<00:00:39.480> fertilization<00:00:40.480> irrigation

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
down are mowing fertilization irrigation

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.020 
down are mowing fertilization irrigation
cultivation<00:00:42.339> and<00:00:42.429> then<00:00:42.550> pest<00:00:42.820> management

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
cultivation and then pest management

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.389 
cultivation and then pest management
okay<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.289> most<00:00:44.469> important<00:00:45.070> being<00:00:45.309> the

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
okay so the most important being the

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.430 
okay so the most important being the
mowing<00:00:45.850> really<00:00:46.570> should<00:00:46.780> be<00:00:46.899> spending<00:00:47.289> more

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
mowing really should be spending more

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.229 
mowing really should be spending more
time<00:00:47.679> and<00:00:47.949> money<00:00:48.070> on<00:00:48.339> mowing<00:00:48.699> than<00:00:48.820> any<00:00:49.030> other

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
cultural practice and then it should

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:52.860 
cultural practice and then it should
follow<00:00:51.429> that<00:00:51.699> order<00:00:51.940> down<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.600> pest

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
follow that order down to pest

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.380 
follow that order down to pest
management<00:00:53.129> being<00:00:54.129> the<00:00:54.339> least<00:00:54.999> amount<00:00:55.269> of

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
management being the least amount of

packages<00:01:50.440> when<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:50.710> buy<00:01:50.860> them<00:01:51.040> right<00:01:51.280> right

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
packages when we buy them right right

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.520 
packages when we buy them right right
okay<00:01:52.540> then<00:01:52.660> what's<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.960> second<00:01:53.290> thing<00:01:53.410> after

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
okay then what's the second thing after

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.240 
okay then what's the second thing after
mowing<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.430> second<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:54.940> fertilization<00:01:55.840> okay

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
mowing so second is fertilization okay

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.070

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
for cool season grasses we should only

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.470 
for cool season grasses we should only
be<00:02:51.470> irrigating<00:02:52.160> three<00:02:52.489> three<00:02:53.030> months<00:02:53.330> out<00:02:53.450> of

be irrigating three three months out of
the<00:02:53.720> year<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.650> should<00:02:54.709> have<00:02:54.829> ample<00:02:55.459> amounts<00:02:55.819> of

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the year we should have ample amounts of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.270 
the year we should have ample amounts of
water<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.299> rest<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.720> time<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.680> when<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:58.010> enter

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
water the rest of time so when we enter

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.039 
water the rest of time so when we enter
this<00:02:58.489> drought<00:02:58.880> period<00:02:59.510> when<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.780> talk<00:03:00.019> about

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
this drought period when you talk about

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.050 
this drought period when you talk about
maintaining<00:03:00.860> cool<00:03:01.069> season<00:03:01.340> grasses<00:03:01.700> with

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
maintaining cool season grasses with

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.870 
maintaining cool season grasses with
irrigation<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:03.079> suggest<00:03:04.010> using<00:03:04.250> light<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
irrigation I suggest using light and

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.880 
irrigation I suggest using light and
frequent<00:03:05.299> irrigation<00:03:05.900> rather<00:03:06.110> than<00:03:06.440> deep<00:03:06.680> and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
frequent irrigation rather than deep and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.160 
frequent irrigation rather than deep and
infrequent<00:03:07.459> when<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> say<00:03:08.299> light<00:03:08.569> infrequent

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
infrequent when I say light infrequent

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.589 
infrequent when I say light infrequent
I'm<00:03:09.290> talking<00:03:09.680> about<00:03:09.739> 1/10<00:03:10.250> 2/10<00:03:11.209> of<00:03:11.329> an<00:03:11.480> inch

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
I'm talking about 1/10 2/10 of an inch

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.039 
I'm talking about 1/10 2/10 of an inch
of<00:03:11.900> water<00:03:11.959> three<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.040> five<00:03:13.280> days<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.030> week<00:03:14.239> so

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
of water three to five days a week so

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.720 
of water three to five days a week so
really<00:03:15.410> it's<00:03:15.590> not<00:03:15.680> much<00:03:16.040> more<00:03:16.280> than<00:03:16.489> an<00:03:16.579> inch

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
really it's not much more than an inch

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.660 
really it's not much more than an inch
of<00:03:16.940> water<00:03:16.970> when<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.870> add<00:03:18.019> all<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.530> up<00:03:18.590> ok<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
of water when you add all that up ok the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.430 
of water when you add all that up ok the
idea<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.359> that<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.750> if<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.049> put<00:03:21.290> down

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
idea is with that is if you put down

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400 
idea is with that is if you put down
deep<00:03:21.739> infrequent<00:03:22.609> irrigation<00:03:23.319> majority<00:03:24.319> of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
deep infrequent irrigation majority of

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.750 
deep infrequent irrigation majority of
the<00:03:24.470> water<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.950> either<00:03:25.190> running<00:03:25.489> off<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
the water is either running off the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.940 
the water is either running off the
surface<00:03:26.299> or<00:03:26.480> infiltrating<00:03:27.230> down<00:03:27.470> through<00:03:27.829> the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
surface or infiltrating down through the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.640 
surface or infiltrating down through the
soil<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.180> light<00:03:29.450> frequent<00:03:29.959> irrigation

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
soil if you do light frequent irrigation

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.460 
soil if you do light frequent irrigation
you<00:03:31.100> supply<00:03:31.519> water<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.269> top<00:03:32.630> few<00:03:33.440> inches

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
you supply water to the top few inches

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.160 
you supply water to the top few inches
of<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.579> grass<00:03:34.819> where<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.540> majority<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:36.019> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
of the grass where the majority of the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.479 
of the grass where the majority of the
roots<00:03:36.350> are<00:03:36.530> growing<00:03:36.650> oh<00:03:37.040> that's<00:03:37.430> very

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
roots are growing oh that's very

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.129 
roots are growing oh that's very
interesting<00:03:37.670> ok<00:03:38.480> we're<00:03:38.660> up<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.870> number<00:03:39.109> four

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
interesting ok we're up to number four

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.520 
interesting ok we're up to number four
so<00:03:39.859> number<00:03:40.130> four<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.489> cultivation<00:03:41.269> if<00:03:42.230> you

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
so number four is cultivation if you

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.280 
so number four is cultivation if you
were<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.920> cor<00:03:43.130> cultivate<00:03:43.730> your<00:03:43.880> lawn<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.660> would

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
were to cor cultivate your lawn I would

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.650 
were to cor cultivate your lawn I would
do<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.829> the<00:03:45.980> late<00:03:46.310> spring<00:03:46.519> early<00:03:47.450> summer

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
do it in the late spring early summer

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.590 
do it in the late spring early summer
months<00:03:48.049> before<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.130> dry<00:03:49.940> period<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
months before the dry period of the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.920 
months before the dry period of the
summer<00:03:50.870> sets<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.549> when<00:03:52.549> we<00:03:52.670> talk<00:03:52.880> about<00:03:53.060> core

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
summer sets in when we talk about core

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.470 
summer sets in when we talk about core
cultivation<00:03:54.709> if<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.700> have<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> perennial

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
cultivation if you have a perennial

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.140 
cultivation if you have a perennial
ryegrass<00:03:56.690> lawn<00:03:57.380> or<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> tall<00:03:57.889> fescue<00:03:58.400> lawn<00:03:58.609> it

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
ryegrass lawn or a tall fescue lawn it

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.849 
ryegrass lawn or a tall fescue lawn it
probably<00:03:59.630> will<00:03:59.810> not<00:03:59.840> need<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.380> be<00:04:00.620> core

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
probably will not need to be core

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.759 
probably will not need to be core
cultivated<00:04:01.489> maybe<00:04:01.700> once<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.239> your<00:04:02.329> lifetime

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
cultivated maybe once in your lifetime

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.770 
cultivated maybe once in your lifetime
ok<00:04:03.769> if<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.069> have<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> creeping<00:04:04.940> red<00:04:05.120> fescue<00:04:05.180> or

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
ok if you have a creeping red fescue or

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.099 
ok if you have a creeping red fescue or
a<00:04:06.310> grass<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.340> grows<00:04:08.120> with<00:04:08.450> stolons<00:04:08.930> or

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
a grass that grows with stolons or

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.680 
a grass that grows with stolons or
rhizomes<00:04:09.680> like<00:04:10.040> creeping<00:04:10.430> bentgrass<00:04:10.639> or<00:04:11.329> or

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
rhizomes like creeping bentgrass or or

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.069 
rhizomes like creeping bentgrass or or
these<00:04:12.620> other<00:04:12.889> Velvet<00:04:13.579> grass<00:04:13.790> type<00:04:14.090> things<00:04:14.419> you

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
these other Velvet grass type things you

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.710 
these other Velvet grass type things you
may<00:04:15.260> have<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.620> do<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:16.130> annual<00:04:16.789> cultivation

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
may have to do a annual cultivation

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.750 
may have to do a annual cultivation
treatment<00:04:18.620> with<00:04:18.769> those<00:04:18.950> type<00:04:19.190> of<00:04:19.340> grass<00:04:19.519> and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
treatment with those type of grass and

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.219 
treatment with those type of grass and
that's<00:04:19.849> what<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.150> takes<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.510> plugs<00:04:20.750> out<00:04:20.989> and

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
that's what it takes the plugs out and

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.200 
that's what it takes the plugs out and
so<00:04:21.380> you're<00:04:21.500> kind<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.859> just<00:04:21.919> getting<00:04:22.729> some<00:04:23.030> more

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
so you're kind of just getting some more

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.790 
so you're kind of just getting some more
soil<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.750> there<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.320> roots<00:04:24.530> have

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
soil in there so that the roots have

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.980 
soil in there so that the roots have
some<00:04:25.010> places<00:04:25.220> to<00:04:25.400> go<00:04:25.610> right<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.659> then<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
some places to go right and so then the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.670 
some places to go right and so then the
fifth<00:04:27.169> one

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
fifth one

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.439 
fifth one
so<00:04:28.280> pest<00:04:28.550> management<00:04:28.729> when<00:04:29.270> we

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
so pest management when we

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.600 
so pest management when we
talk<00:04:29.569> about<00:04:29.719> pest<00:04:30.050> management<00:04:30.249> you<00:04:31.249> know<00:04:31.370> in

talk about pest management you know in

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.489 
talk about pest management you know in
the<00:04:31.729> Pacific<00:04:32.150> Northwest<00:04:32.270> here<00:04:32.900> there's<00:04:33.259> not<00:04:33.469> a

whole lot of insect pressure you could

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.529 
whole lot of insect pressure you could
have<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.319> European<00:04:37.219> crane<00:04:37.460> fly<00:04:37.699> problems<00:04:38.330> in

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
have some European crane fly problems in

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.600 
have some European crane fly problems in
the<00:04:38.689> the<00:04:39.319> early<00:04:39.349> spring<00:04:39.949> months<00:04:40.279> the<00:04:40.580> other

big one is going to be some of the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.399 
big one is going to be some of the
broadleaf<00:04:43.520> weeds<00:04:43.849> if<00:04:44.599> you<00:04:44.960> were<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.229> consider

broadleaf weeds if you were to consider

a broadleaf weed herbicide application
the<00:04:47.900> best<00:04:48.139> time<00:04:48.379> to<00:04:48.559> do<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.710> would<00:04:48.919> be<00:04:49.069> in<00:04:49.189> the

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:49.309 
the best time to do it would be in the

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.649 
the best time to do it would be in the
fall<00:04:49.580> and<00:04:50.080> I'm<00:04:51.080> going<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.319> steal<00:04:51.589> an<00:04:51.830> extension

fourth of October ok to knock them out
in<00:05:02.449> the<00:05:02.539> fall<00:05:02.779> there<00:05:03.020> that's<00:05:03.439> great<00:05:03.680> and

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
in the fall there that's great and

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.920 
in the fall there that's great and
really<00:05:04.249> doing<00:05:04.580> spot<00:05:04.909> spraying<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.659> probably

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
really doing spot spraying is probably

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.089 
really doing spot spraying is probably
the<00:05:06.050> best<00:05:06.289> you<00:05:06.439> want<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.710> see<00:05:06.860> it<00:05:06.949> when<00:05:07.039> it's

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
the best you want to see it when it's

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.519 
the best you want to see it when it's
little<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.759> then<00:05:07.879> you<00:05:07.909> can<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.900> area<00:05:09.349> is

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
little and then you can that area is

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.829 
little and then you can that area is
going<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:09.800> fill<00:05:10.189> in<00:05:10.310> fast<00:05:10.669> instead<00:05:11.449> of<00:05:11.599> letting

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:11.839 
going to fill in fast instead of letting

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.600 
going to fill in fast instead of letting
the<00:05:11.930> weeds<00:05:12.139> really<00:05:12.439> get<00:05:12.560> away<00:05:12.740> from<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.159> right

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
the weeds really get away from you right

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.510 
the weeds really get away from you right
so<00:05:13.819> when<00:05:13.969> we<00:05:13.999> talk<00:05:14.300> about<00:05:14.330> spot<00:05:15.319> spraying<00:05:15.740> when

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
so when we talk about spot spraying when

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.909 
so when we talk about spot spraying when
you<00:05:16.639> think<00:05:16.879> about<00:05:17.120> weeds<00:05:17.419> in<00:05:17.629> your<00:05:17.659> lawn<00:05:17.919> weeds

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
you think about weeds in your lawn weeds

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.959 
you think about weeds in your lawn weeds
are<00:05:19.219> not<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:20.509> cause<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.020> poor<00:05:21.620> grass<00:05:21.979> or<00:05:22.729> turf

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
are not the cause of poor grass or turf

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.209 
are not the cause of poor grass or turf
weeds<00:05:23.719> are<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:23.990> result<00:05:24.499> of<00:05:24.680> poor<00:05:24.949> turf

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
weeds are the result of poor turf

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.219 
weeds are the result of poor turf
management<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.449> when<00:05:26.629> you've<00:05:26.779> got<00:05:26.810> an

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
management so when you've got an

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.129 
management so when you've got an
intensely<00:05:27.800> weed<00:05:28.669> populated<00:05:29.599> lawn<00:05:29.809> you<00:05:29.990> should

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
intensely weed populated lawn you should

do<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.669> need<00:05:37.819> to<00:05:38.060> cultivate<00:05:38.270> compacted<00:05:39.259> areas

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
do I need to cultivate compacted areas

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.429 
do I need to cultivate compacted areas
then<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.819> think<00:05:41.089> after<00:05:41.569> all<00:05:41.779> of<00:05:41.990> those<00:05:42.110> things

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439 
then you think after all of those things

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:44.860 
then you think after all of those things
you<00:05:42.560> consider<00:05:43.039> doing<00:05:43.669> your<00:05:43.909> weed<00:05:44.120> application

you consider doing your weed application
and<00:05:44.990> yes<00:05:45.169> spot<00:05:45.499> treatment<00:05:45.949> is<00:05:46.069> better<00:05:46.279> than

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
and yes spot treatment is better than

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.429 
and yes spot treatment is better than
broadcast<00:05:46.789> treatment<00:05:47.569> if<00:05:47.719> you're<00:05:48.259> going<00:05:48.379> to

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439 
broadcast treatment if you're going to

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.839 
broadcast treatment if you're going to
spot<00:05:48.680> treat<00:05:48.979> your<00:05:49.099> lawn<00:05:49.310> I<00:05:49.339> would<00:05:49.639> also

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
suggest in the fall coming in and

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.429 
suggest in the fall coming in and
receding<00:05:52.580> some<00:05:52.789> of<00:05:52.909> those<00:05:53.029> areas<00:05:53.330> because<00:05:54.319> you

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
receding some of those areas because you

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.320 
receding some of those areas because you
think<00:05:54.649> about<00:05:54.860> that<00:05:55.099> if<00:05:55.249> you<00:05:55.430> remove<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:56.089> weed

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
think about that if you remove the weed

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.300 
think about that if you remove the weed
and<00:05:56.659> you<00:05:56.930> kill<00:05:57.199> an<00:05:57.349> area<00:05:57.649> what's<00:05:58.129> going<00:05:58.279> to

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
and you kill an area what's going to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.269 
and you kill an area what's going to
come<00:05:58.520> back<00:05:58.759> another<00:05:59.060> weed<00:05:59.379> right<00:06:00.379> so<00:06:00.919> Alex

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.279 
come back another weed right so Alex

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.949 
come back another weed right so Alex

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
this area we're standing on is not the

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.110 
this area we're standing on is not the
optimum<00:06:03.379> law<00:06:03.560> and<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:03.860> would<00:06:03.919> be<00:06:04.189> hoping<00:06:04.520> for<00:06:04.580> so

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
optimum law and I would be hoping for so

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.829 
optimum law and I would be hoping for so
what's<00:06:05.300> going<00:06:05.599> on<00:06:05.719> here<00:06:06.259> ok<00:06:06.919> so<00:06:07.279> yes<00:06:08.029> when<00:06:08.719> we
