00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.330
 hair 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.599
 if you want to learn continue 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.599
 watching 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.580
 As you can see, the hair already had 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 mecha and at the ends he had ink 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 chestnut the client likes the hair well 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.210
 platinum so we'll take it all 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 this golden water bleacher 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 were alfaparf coaches of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.220
 40 volumes as always the hair was 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.970
 divided into five parts two parts 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.879
 two parts on the side and one part 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.620
 on the top of the head to make the wicks 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.500
 we will get fine wicks of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 approximately one meter wide 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.130
 sew the wick with the comb in this way 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 What I do in the video 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.510
 then the packet with paper failed 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 aluminum foil and pass the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.399
 bleach that locks in touching the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 root will not tarnish I fasten the paper 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.690
 aluminum or catch to paper 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.190
 aluminum does not slip so as not to stain 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.380
 customer anger 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.660

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.420

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.950

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.280
 aluminum papers first by taking 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.870
