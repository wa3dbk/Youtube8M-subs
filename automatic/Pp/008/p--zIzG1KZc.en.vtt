for<00:00:12.179> us<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.570> he<00:00:12.900> tests<00:00:13.320> them<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.889> his<00:00:14.130> machine

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

for us and he tests them on his machine
now<00:00:15.269> I'm<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> little<00:00:15.660> unconventional<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.410> like

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
now I'm a little unconventional I like

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.820 
now I'm a little unconventional I like
to<00:00:16.710> test<00:00:16.980> them<00:00:17.190> individually<00:00:18.500> every<00:00:19.500> single

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to test them individually every single

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.320 
to test them individually every single
one<00:00:19.920> I'm<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> different<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.609> now<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
one I'm a different way now this is a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
one I'm a different way now this is a
six<00:00:21.689> power<00:00:21.930> extra<00:00:22.380> heavy<00:00:22.650> I'll<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.550> my

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
six power extra heavy I'll put it in my

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.710 
six power extra heavy I'll put it in my
holder<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.830> flex<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:27.320> beyond<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:29.720> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
holder here and flex it beyond what you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.130 
holder here and flex it beyond what you
as<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> fisherman<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:32.630> work<00:00:34.670> okay

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
as a fisherman are gonna work okay

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
as a fisherman are gonna work okay
now<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> test<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.190> five<00:00:38.670> power

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
now we're going to test a five power

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530 
now we're going to test a five power
penny<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.320> moderate<00:00:40.680> fat<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:42.390> has<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
penny it's a moderate fat it has a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.529 
penny it's a moderate fat it has a
different<00:00:43.020> flex<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:44.610> requires<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.120> different

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
different flex so requires a different

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
different flex so requires a different
test<00:00:46.280> I'll<00:00:47.280> test<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> backbone<00:00:49.370> then<00:00:50.370> I'm

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
test I'll test the backbone then I'm

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
test I'll test the backbone then I'm
pulling<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.090> area<00:00:51.329> then<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.350> gonna<00:00:52.500> work

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pulling on this area then I'm gonna work

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.250 
pulling on this area then I'm gonna work
this<00:00:52.829> faster<00:00:53.489> tick<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.870> pulling

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this faster tick right here I'm pulling

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.860 
this faster tick right here I'm pulling
on<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.680> machine<00:00:55.980> doesn't<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.940> then

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
on this machine doesn't do this then

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.590 
on this machine doesn't do this then
have<00:00:58.140> variations<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.430> testing<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.390> do

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
have variations in the testing we do

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.619 
have variations in the testing we do
that's<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.109> good<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.820> now<00:01:02.820> full<00:01:03.210> power

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that's what good to go now full power

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.640 
that's what good to go now full power
medium<00:01:03.960> pin<00:01:04.519> completely<00:01:05.519> different<00:01:06.090> flex

faster<00:01:07.670> less<00:01:08.670> power<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.420> I'll<00:01:09.990> test<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
faster less power here I'll test the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
faster less power here I'll test the
backbone<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.130> make<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:12.060> no

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
backbone here make sure there's no

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.050 
backbone here make sure there's no
defects<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> I'll<00:01:12.990> work<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.729> I'm<00:01:14.729> pulling

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
defects and I'll work it up I'm pulling

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.190 
defects and I'll work it up I'm pulling
on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> tip<00:01:15.509> more<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.600> riding<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
on the tip more and riding here is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
on the tip more and riding here is
getting<00:01:19.439> stretched<00:01:19.680> hard<00:01:20.450> like<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.630> you're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
getting stretched hard like when you're

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590 
getting stretched hard like when you're

money now a three pound medium heavy
it's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> best<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:30.290> different<00:01:31.290> tests<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it's the best at different tests it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's the best at different tests it
