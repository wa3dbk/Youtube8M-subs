00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
because earlier today I was going to put

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.799 
because earlier today I was going to put
my<00:00:56.829> flowmaster<00:00:57.429> 40<00:00:57.729> series<00:00:57.940> muffler<00:00:58.629> on<00:00:58.690> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and when I cut the pipe behind the cat I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960 
and when I cut the pipe behind the cat I
noticed<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.750> she<00:01:04.780> sounded<00:01:05.320> really<00:01:05.530> good
