00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
who based them but somebody did but what

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
who based them but somebody did but what
would<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:45.079> what<00:00:46.079> type<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> atmosphere

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
would it be like what type of atmosphere

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
would it be like what type of atmosphere
do<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> would<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.629> there

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
do you think it would be like if there

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.250 
do you think it would be like if there
was<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> real<00:00:50.399> Duel<00:00:50.969> Academy<00:00:51.260> most

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
was actually a real Duel Academy most

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.450 
was actually a real Duel Academy most
like<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.770> you'd<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.070> based<00:00:53.309> in

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
like I don't think you'd be based in

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 
like I don't think you'd be based in
Japan<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.510> everything's<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.140> Japan<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
Japan because everything's in Japan it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
Japan because everything's in Japan it
seems<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.539> Konami

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
seems like that's you know it's Konami

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.459 
seems like that's you know it's Konami
he's<00:00:58.199> home<00:00:58.410> base<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> everything<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.340> I

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
he's home base and everything but I

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.820 
he's home base and everything but I
think<00:01:01.469> he<00:01:01.559> would<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.430> interesting<00:01:03.830> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
think he would be kind of interesting to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.109 
think he would be kind of interesting to
see<00:01:04.860> what<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.970> mean

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
see what it would be like I mean

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
see what it would be like I mean

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.390 
know that but I think it would be more
of<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> college<00:01:20.640> atmosphere<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.659> mean<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
of a college atmosphere I mean really it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
of a college atmosphere I mean really it
probably<00:01:23.729> would<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.540> if<00:01:24.659> it'd

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
probably would be I don't know if it'd

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.600 
probably would be I don't know if it'd
be<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.930> an<00:01:25.049> island<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> dormant<00:01:26.130> volcano

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
be on an island with the dormant volcano
