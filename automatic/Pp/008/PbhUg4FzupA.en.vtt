00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.839
 why do I compensate 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.949
 here is our way of cooking the saddle of rabbit 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.409
 I will first de-boned the entire rabbit saddle to remove the clamp 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:17.409
 but keeping its shape 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.009
 carefully cut small fillets 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.369
 then not with the tip of the knife passed under the first flakes 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.220
 perform the same operation on the other side 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.350
 the spine is partly cleared and now I'm going to remove 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 the other part of the spine in December the knife near the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.870
 stern 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.329
 now with the hands carefully remove 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.460
 the whole of the asse 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.070
 and now you have the rabbit saddle completely boned 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.740
 on an aluminum foil arrange a few air intakes of parsley fry 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.450
 tarragon 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.460
 season the salt and pepper part of the mill 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.690
 you ride their human adventure 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 to restore it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 sprinkle all the stakeholders 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.170
 post the part where the 1970s 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.580
 in a casserole with a drizzle of oil 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.900
 color all the reams of the appearance of his passes in 56 minutes 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.230
 oven 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
 for endives remove the first leaves of palm 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.480
 then cope the heart 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.660
 plucking throwing landis 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.399
 I preferred the oven to 200 francs of debts to mazamet 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.159
 I cover the casserole and I will continue the sustainable cooking of the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.360
 thought 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.369
 in a large skillet or a hot wok 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.479
 arrange with wolves to read and have endives read 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 few minutes for fathers and crunchy 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.470
 season 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 salt and pepper mix quickly 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 our rabbit and then I'm holding back now for all of 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.110
 aluminum 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.540
 then the group in thin slice 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 as in the times 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.720
 seriously deposit the cooked endive leaves 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.599
 in a plate 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.119
 then to stay there the times 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.159
 just in front of 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.159
 and finish with some tarragon leaves 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.869
 and also the ravel waltz of the palestra have a big date 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.790
 France is everything
