pretty<00:02:36.010> good<00:02:36.160> hair<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> never<00:02:36.790> used<00:02:37.239> this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
pretty good hair I never used this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.589 
pretty good hair I never used this
before<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:38.140> remy<00:02:38.890> um<00:02:39.310> I'm<00:02:40.180> pretty<00:02:40.239> impressed

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
before it's remy um I'm pretty impressed

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.000 
before it's remy um I'm pretty impressed
with<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.910> think<00:02:42.910> my<00:02:43.450> 12-inch<00:02:44.049> pack<00:02:44.440> was<00:02:44.769> like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
with it I think my 12-inch pack was like

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.809 
with it I think my 12-inch pack was like
fifty<00:02:45.760> eight<00:02:45.910> dollars<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.680> 14-inch<00:02:48.310> was

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
fifty eight dollars and the 14-inch was

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.150 
fifty eight dollars and the 14-inch was
about<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:49.480> I'm<00:02:49.989> gonna<00:02:50.140> say<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.500> 65

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
about like I'm gonna say like 65

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.910 
about like I'm gonna say like 65
something<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.900> wasn't<00:02:53.170> too<00:02:53.500> too

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
something like that so it wasn't too too

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.119 
something like that so it wasn't too too
expensive<00:02:54.579> but<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:56.260> opinion<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.920> hair

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
expensive but my opinion on the hair

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.400 
expensive but my opinion on the hair
it's<00:02:57.819> pretty<00:02:58.209> good<00:02:58.480> there's<00:02:59.019> not<00:02:59.200> much

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's pretty good there's not much

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.699 
it's pretty good there's not much
shedding<00:03:00.040> um<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:01.569> waviness<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.379> it<00:03:02.530> i'll

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
shedding um the waviness of it i'll

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.410 
shedding um the waviness of it i'll
probably<00:03:02.920> make<00:03:03.099> another<00:03:03.250> video<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.970> when<00:03:04.390> I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
probably make another video like when I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.780 
probably make another video like when I
wash<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.900> next<00:03:05.260> time<00:03:05.410> or<00:03:05.590> something<00:03:05.920> but<00:03:06.129> when

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
wash it next time or something but when

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.789 
wash it next time or something but when
it<00:03:06.910> was<00:03:07.060> wavy<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.840> was<00:03:07.989> really<00:03:08.290> nice<00:03:08.440> like<00:03:08.650> it

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
it was wavy it was really nice like it

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.569 
it was wavy it was really nice like it
was<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.220> natural<00:03:09.959> nice<00:03:10.959> flowy<00:03:11.920> type<00:03:12.430> of

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
was just a natural nice flowy type of

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.430 
was just a natural nice flowy type of
wave<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.879> kind<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.180> looked<00:03:13.359> like<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.750> curled<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
wave it kind of looked like I curled it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.129 
wave it kind of looked like I curled it
but<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> didn't<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:16.030> I'm<00:03:16.329> going<00:03:16.569> out<00:03:16.810> tonight

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
but I didn't but I'm going out tonight

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.340 
but I didn't but I'm going out tonight
so<00:03:17.380> i'll<00:03:17.470> probably<00:03:17.769> end<00:03:17.980> up<00:03:18.340> curling<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.350> with

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350
