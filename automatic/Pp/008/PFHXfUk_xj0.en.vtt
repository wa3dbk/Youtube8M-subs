00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello my name is Stanislav 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.599
 do-it-yourself and I want to share with you 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.790
 how to do at home 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 high-quality photos so as not to be ashamed 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 had to share them with friends 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.910
 either photos for your stores or 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.510
 ad here is an example of some of my 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.000
 of works 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 I often do something with my own hands 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.010
 then lay out instructions like this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.010
 done on the internet here are some more 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010
 photos 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.609
 I want to show you how to literally any 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.769
 camera 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:50.769
 you can take such pictures 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.769
 so that they really look like 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.769
 professional 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.820
 some pictures can even be taken on 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.820
 mobile phone 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.900
 so for this short video you 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 learn how and what to do 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.880
 such photos as to shoot correctly and how 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 edit them later 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.410
 perhaps we will start with editing the quality 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.120
 photo editor 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.450
 didn't like paint.net site get 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.770
 paint.net 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.840
 it is free there is a Russian version 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.940
 we run runs much faster 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.390
 than photoshop is very simple 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.360
 use before loading 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.280
 Any new photos on the site I always him 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.280
 I start doing a series of operations that 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 greatly improves the appearance of photos 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.470
 choose some picture 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.179
 let it be 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.560
 this 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 click open 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:22.719
 first need to change the size 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:25.930
 images to reduce file size 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:30.670
 but 1200 will be at home and optimal 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.750
 option then the correction is changed 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.750
 brightness and contrast 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 so already see a white background appeared but not 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.390
 perfect you can shift a little our 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 figurine right select 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.980
 cut control x select all control 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 and click remove paste 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.460
 fill all with white background 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.560
 We are now looking at your monitor under 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.890
 different angles to leave no 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.500
 strips and selections around 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.290
 Well, everything seems to be fine after 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.709
 changes in contrast and brightness well somehow 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.700
 our figurine turned pale let's increase 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.700
 more saturation 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:45.220
 but so prettier also possible 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.270
 put some text on 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.690
 picture 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:56.540
 I have prepared in advance different inscriptions and 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:00.770
 fonts and now itâ€™s very convenient 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.860
 quickly superimposed before creating a new 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.860
 layer 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.980
 ok 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.590
 somehow so literally in a minute we 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:20.190
 edited the photo handed to her 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.490
 pretty pretty look but 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.880
 we were initially not badly done 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.370
 picture and now tell you how 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.170
 Doing good soap at home 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.580
 pictures so as not to sit and not 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.850
 edit them for an hour and a half 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.850
 1 photo 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.490
 the first thing we need is this 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.990
 called photoboxing is a box in which 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.270
 It turns out that these are without shadow 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:57.060
 photos with a beautiful flare are 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.100
 professional photo equipment and very 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.919
 very expensive and I will tell you how the same 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.400
 the same photo quality can 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.770
 to get home literally every person 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.669
 who can turn on mode 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.780
 Macro on his camera and 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:20.449
 why do you need photoboxing 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.190
 we see photo 1 without him and photo 2 with him 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:26.780
 This photo is very fast then you can 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.350
 edit difference from this photo 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.850
 how is it done the manufacturing process 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.419
 described in principle on my website but if 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.400
 briefly the usual cardboard box 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:46.039
 cut from above to open and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.039
 peeled off with paper 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:55.410
 there is another little secret so that 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.310
 we had no harsh shadows like here 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.660
 for your camera 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.610
 need to use a diffuser in 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.500
 can serve as a diffuser 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:12.160
 a piece of paper napkin photographers often 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.390
 use napkins and either so i did 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:20.290
 own hands as this gizmo 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:22.960
 he puts on the usual shoe on 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:29.490
 this ordinary soap dish is not a mirror is in 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:33.610
 around 200 dollars is worn on top and 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.790
 we see an example of a photo without a lens 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.700
 sharp shadow is not very lost is 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.300
 photo and photo with diffuser 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.610
 softer more attractive 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.730
 looks like a background for 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.700
 decorations 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:56.830
 I often used using substrates 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:00.640
 for it's this type, I wrote more 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:04.210
 one with instructions on how to age paper in 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.730
 homemade experimented 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:12.090
 I tried a lot of things and stopped at 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.090
 one recipe 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:20.340
 with which you can get here 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:22.470
 such a beautiful substrate and make 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:28.020
 photos are antique 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.890
 steampunk style for jewelry either at that 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.890
 you have enough imagination 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:38.310
 Thank you for your attention, I hope my advice and 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.790
 enemies will prove useful to you until 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.790
 meeting 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.250
 I will be happy to share with you 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.250
 anything else goodbye
