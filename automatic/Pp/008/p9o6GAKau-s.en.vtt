00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
second technique that I showed you

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.510 
second technique that I showed you
opening<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.820> this<00:01:52.030> way<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.899> get<00:01:53.110> cleaner

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
opening it this way you get cleaner

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.160 
opening it this way you get cleaner
kernels<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.610> get<00:01:54.880> less<00:01:55.240> juice<00:01:55.660> squirting

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
kernels you get less juice squirting

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.109
