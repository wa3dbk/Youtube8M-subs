an initiative track which you set up her

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
an initiative track which you set up her
encounter<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> new<00:00:59.309> encounter

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
encounter you get a new encounter

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
encounter you get a new encounter
whenever<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> flip<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:00.600> board<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.350> every

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
whenever you flip a new board so every

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.900 
whenever you flip a new board so every
time<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> new<00:01:02.219> board<00:01:02.460> you'll<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.879> out

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
time you get a new board you'll go out

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
time you get a new board you'll go out
and<00:01:03.180> eggs<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> you'll<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> new<00:01:04.110> board<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and eggs that you'll get a new board and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.170 
and eggs that you'll get a new board and
you'll<00:01:05.220> put<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.060> some

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you'll put it up and you'll put some

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.310 
you'll put it up and you'll put some
monsters<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:06.840> you'll<00:01:06.960> begin<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
monsters up and then you'll begin to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
monsters up and then you'll begin to
fight<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.460> initiative<00:01:08.880> track<00:01:09.090> tells

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
fight them the initiative track tells

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
fight them the initiative track tells
you<00:01:09.479> who<00:01:09.630> goes<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> when<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you who goes and when it's actually a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.080 
you who goes and when it's actually a
pretty<00:01:10.979> clever<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> keep<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> game

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
pretty clever way to keep the game

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810 
pretty clever way to keep the game
moving<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.750> varies<00:01:13.140> by<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> encounter<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
moving it varies by the encounter so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
moving it varies by the encounter so
what<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.060> found<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.110> had<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> hard

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
what we found is actually we had a hard

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
what we found is actually we had a hard

the rest of the party can kill
everything<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> tile<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.560> had

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
everything on the tile and we had

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
everything on the tile and we had
another<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.610> were<00:01:32.700> getting<00:01:33.000> ready<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
another just as we were getting ready to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.749 
another just as we were getting ready to
escape<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:34.020> crow<00:01:34.560> swooped<00:01:34.890> down<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.189> killed

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
escape a crow swooped down and killed

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.130 
escape a crow swooped down and killed
one<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> our<00:01:36.150> other<00:01:36.299> members<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> captured

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
one of our other members and captured

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
one of our other members and captured
her<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.530> had<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> go<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> deal

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
her so we had to go back in and deal

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
her so we had to go back in and deal
with<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.049> tried<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
with that and this one we tried the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
with that and this one we tried the
scenario<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> couple<00:01:41.159> times<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.490> lost<00:01:41.640> both

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
scenario a couple times we lost both

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
scenario a couple times we lost both
times<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.390> we're<00:01:43.350> finding<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> game<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> be

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
times so we're finding the game to be

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
times so we're finding the game to be
pretty<00:01:44.399> challenging<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.020> could

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
pretty challenging actually now it could

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.330 
pretty challenging actually now it could
be<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> first<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.040> we're<00:01:47.159> playing

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
be this is the first time we're playing

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
be this is the first time we're playing
it<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.000> I'd<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> say<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:48.960> time

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it and as I'd like to say the first time

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.990 
it and as I'd like to say the first time
I<00:01:49.140> play<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> game<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> warn<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> you're

characters in the game feel integrated

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.360 
characters in the game feel integrated
to<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.930> story<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.349> felt<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.799> more<00:02:25.069> than<00:02:25.250> in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
to this story I felt that more than in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.520 
to this story I felt that more than in
descent<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.970> really<00:02:26.269> felt<00:02:26.569> like<00:02:26.659> we<00:02:27.290> were<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
descent we really felt like we were the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.699 
descent we really felt like we were the
little<00:02:27.890> guys<00:02:28.069> fighting<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> big<00:02:29.090> guys<00:02:29.299> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
little guys fighting the big guys I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.050 
little guys fighting the big guys I
don't<00:02:30.709> know<00:02:30.830> if<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.069> would<00:02:31.250> play<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.459> multiple

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
don't know if I would play it multiple

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.089 
don't know if I would play it multiple
question<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.599> role<00:02:32.810> again<00:02:33.140> because<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.890> lot<00:02:34.069> of

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
question to role again because a lot of

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.009 
question to role again because a lot of
the<00:02:34.220> mechanisms<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.940> tied<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> dice<00:02:35.720> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
the mechanisms are tied to the dice and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.229 
the mechanisms are tied to the dice and
so<00:02:36.769> if<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.129> terribly<00:02:37.489> unlucky<00:02:37.790> most<00:02:38.120> of

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
so if you're terribly unlucky most of

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.970 
so if you're terribly unlucky most of
the<00:02:38.299> time<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.900> am<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.470> might<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:39.799> enjoy

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the time like I am you might not enjoy

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.220 
the time like I am you might not enjoy
it<00:02:40.310> after<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.640> couple<00:02:40.879> questions<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.659> we<00:02:42.079> had<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
it after a couple questions but we had a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.140 
it after a couple questions but we had a
great<00:02:42.470> time<00:02:42.620> overall<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.549> looking<00:02:43.910> forward

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
great time overall I'm looking forward

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.449 
great time overall I'm looking forward
to<00:02:44.209> playing<00:02:44.390> another<00:02:44.660> quest<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.370> think<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
to playing another quest I think the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.250 
to playing another quest I think the
comparison<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:47.090> descent<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.870> natural

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
comparison to descent is a natural

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.289 
comparison to descent is a natural
comparison<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.829> have<00:02:48.859> to<00:02:49.069> say<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.519> grow<00:02:50.090> very

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
comparison I have to say I grow very

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.539 
comparison I have to say I grow very
weary<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.750> descent

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
weary of descent

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.550 
weary of descent
I've<00:02:52.549> played<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.180> some<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.049> find<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.410> get

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I've played it some and I find I get

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.500 
I've played it some and I find I get
very<00:02:54.680> tired<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.819> very<00:02:56.120> heavily

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
very tired of it this very heavily

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.289 
very tired of it this very heavily
tactical<00:02:57.140> game<00:02:57.319> this<00:02:57.950> game<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.819> play<00:02:59.090> in

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
tactical game this game you can play in

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.750 
tactical game this game you can play in
that<00:02:59.420> same<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> moves<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:01.069> lot<00:03:01.190> faster

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
that same way but it moves a lot faster

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.119 
that same way but it moves a lot faster
it<00:03:02.540> seems<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.170> lot<00:03:03.319> faster<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.859> zip<00:03:04.010> around

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
it seems it's a lot faster to zip around

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.800 
it seems it's a lot faster to zip around
the<00:03:04.370> board<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:05.030> stuff<00:03:05.299> it<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.569> still

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the board and do stuff it is still

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.140 
the board and do stuff it is still
basically<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.440> tactical<00:03:07.040> battle<00:03:07.370> game<00:03:07.579> you're

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
basically a tactical battle game you're

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.550 
basically a tactical battle game you're
still<00:03:08.359> doing<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.629> but<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:08.930> felt<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.319> was<00:03:09.410> more

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
still doing that but I felt it was more

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.069 
still doing that but I felt it was more
fast-paced<00:03:09.950> than<00:03:10.280> descent<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:12.049> a

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
fast-paced than descent I it's as a

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.020 
fast-paced than descent I it's as a
cooperative<00:03:12.560> game<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.849> game<00:03:14.000> has

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
cooperative game and so the game has

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.759 
cooperative game and so the game has
instructions<00:03:14.599> but<00:03:15.230> there's<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.500> lot<00:03:15.739> more

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
instructions but there's a lot more

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.150 
instructions but there's a lot more
story<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.819> than<00:03:17.480> say<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> Dungeons<00:03:19.010> &amp;

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
story to it than say in the Dungeons &amp;

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.409 
story to it than say in the Dungeons &amp;
Dragons<00:03:19.190> game<00:03:19.549> where<00:03:19.910> you're<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:20.180> sort<00:03:20.359> of

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
Dragons game where you're just sort of

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.789 
Dragons game where you're just sort of
drawing<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.750> tiles<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.169> looking<00:03:21.440> for<00:03:21.620> things

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
drawing the tiles and looking for things

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.589 
drawing the tiles and looking for things
so<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.579> sort<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.819> sits<00:03:22.970> between<00:03:23.120> those<00:03:23.450> two

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
so it sort of sits between those two

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.940 
so it sort of sits between those two
games<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:24.260> you're<00:03:24.380> looking<00:03:24.590> something<00:03:24.799> for

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
games if you're looking something for

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.500 
games if you're looking something for
something<00:03:25.130> that's<00:03:25.370> lighter<00:03:25.669> than<00:03:25.940> descent<00:03:26.299> in

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
something that's lighter than descent in

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.009 
something that's lighter than descent in
complexity<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:28.099> little<00:03:28.310> faster<00:03:28.669> paced

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
complexity and a little faster paced

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.120 
complexity and a little faster paced
it's<00:03:30.019> not<00:03:30.200> as<00:03:30.349> deep<00:03:30.500> though<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.799> don't<00:03:31.069> have

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
it's not as deep though you don't have

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.920 
it's not as deep though you don't have
nearly<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:31.790> character<00:03:32.239> development<00:03:32.599> your

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
nearly the character development your

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.720 
nearly the character development your
characters<00:03:33.349> can<00:03:33.859> develop<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.340> little<00:03:34.579> bit

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
characters can develop a little bit

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.640 
characters can develop a little bit
between<00:03:34.970> chapters<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:36.019> this<00:03:36.139> game<00:03:36.349> but<00:03:36.560> not

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
between chapters of this game but not

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.080 
between chapters of this game but not
too<00:03:36.859> much<00:03:37.010> so<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.639> want<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.849> little

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
too much so if you want a little

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670 
too much so if you want a little
character<00:03:38.540> development<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.139> little<00:03:39.380> story

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
character development and a little story

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.440 
character development and a little story
without<00:03:40.190> all<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.519> overhead<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.880> descent<00:03:41.269> I'd

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
without all the overhead of descent I'd

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.120 
without all the overhead of descent I'd
say<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.690> take<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> look<00:03:42.139> at<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.530> like<00:03:42.980> the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
say to take a look at it I like the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.470 
say to take a look at it I like the
theme<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.579> theme<00:03:43.609> is<00:03:43.910> fun<00:03:44.150> they've<00:03:44.329> done<00:03:44.450> a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
theme the theme is fun they've done a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.110 
theme the theme is fun they've done a
good<00:03:44.720> job<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:45.200> making<00:03:45.349> some<00:03:45.620> interesting

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
good job of making some interesting

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.849 
good job of making some interesting
monsters<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.419> deal<00:03:47.599> with<00:03:47.630> like<00:03:48.470> we<00:03:48.709> had

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
monsters that you deal with like we had

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.080 
monsters that you deal with like we had
to<00:03:48.950> deal<00:03:49.069> with<00:03:49.099> a<00:03:49.250> cat<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.790> cat<00:03:49.819> was

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
to deal with a cat and the cat was

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.640 
to deal with a cat and the cat was
pouncing<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.660> places<00:03:51.139> and<00:03:51.319> it's<00:03:51.410> moving

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
pouncing on places and it's moving

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.680 
pouncing on places and it's moving
around<00:03:51.889> some<00:03:52.579> cool<00:03:52.849> theme<00:03:53.090> that's<00:03:53.329> going<00:03:53.569> on

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
around some cool theme that's going on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.599 
around some cool theme that's going on
so<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.620> say<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.799> like<00:03:55.010> this<00:03:55.160> game<00:03:55.400> I

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
so I have to say I like this game I

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.699 
so I have to say I like this game I
don't<00:03:56.180> think<00:03:56.569> I'm<00:03:56.660> gonna<00:03:56.750> play<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.079> whole<00:03:57.470> day

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
don't think I'm gonna play a whole day

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.199 
don't think I'm gonna play a whole day
of<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.980> I'll<00:03:58.129> play<00:03:58.280> I'll<00:03:58.609> pull<00:03:58.849> it<00:03:58.879> out<00:03:59.090> and

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
of it I'll play I'll pull it out and

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.460 
of it I'll play I'll pull it out and
we'll<00:03:59.299> play<00:03:59.450> one<00:03:59.599> adventure<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.200> work<00:04:00.290> our

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470

way<00:04:00.500> through<00:04:00.709> that<00:04:00.799> but<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.940> like<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.269> better

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
way through that but I like it better

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.059 
way through that but I like it better
than<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:02.690> Dungeons<00:04:03.079> &amp;<00:04:03.230> Dragons<00:04:03.260> game<00:04:03.590> because

than the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game because
I<00:04:04.099> like<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.849> the<00:04:04.879> stronger<00:04:05.629> story<00:04:05.959> drive<00:04:06.230> of

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
I like the the stronger story drive of

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.720 
I like the the stronger story drive of
what's<00:04:06.530> going<00:04:06.709> on<00:04:06.829> here<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.129> I<00:04:07.160> have<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.579> give

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
what's going on here so I have to give

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.220 
what's going on here so I have to give
this<00:04:07.849> game<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.090> thumbs<00:04:08.359> up<00:04:08.510> I'm<00:04:08.660> glad<00:04:08.780> I<00:04:08.870> own<00:04:09.109> it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
this game a thumbs up I'm glad I own it

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.050 
this game a thumbs up I'm glad I own it
and<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.620> don't<00:04:09.680> plan<00:04:09.949> on<00:04:10.129> selling<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.519> so<00:04:10.910> that's

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
and I don't plan on selling it so that's
