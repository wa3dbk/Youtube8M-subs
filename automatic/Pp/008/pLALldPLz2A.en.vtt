00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.699
 working with fashion production is always 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.340
 a challenge is because to actually work 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.020
 with production and challenging the producer he 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.220
 have to be born producers have to have the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 son of a producer 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.699
 It has to be very fast too. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.720
 dynamic he has to think and has to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.720
 be very creative 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 I think it 's the fashion production here in 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.920
 Bethlehem is something quite peculiar because 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.879
 When are we going to do, for example, a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.160
 retail is any one of these retail stores. 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 The department that we work here is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.719
 We have to pay close attention to the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.329
 street fashion in what people wear 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.070
 that people buy and then people 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 you can not get away from it too much sometimes 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.390
 want to modernize a bit but can not 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.390
 be both for not running away from the target audience 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.830
 need to warm the market understood I 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.290
 I like to advertise but I think 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 No one of us has to live alone. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 of this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 I think we can try 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.590
 several other areas 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.360
 understood I think we can do 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.049
 theater I think we can do it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.049
 movie theater 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 work with fashion production here in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 land is very cool because the team is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.819
 very nice 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.500
 then both the team of producers 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.429
 directors is is a very joint team 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 very close together 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.789
 I do not think there are any producers 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 I do not know any producers here in this 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.700
 state that seeks excellence in form 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.899
 with the three search be it on the accessory in the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.759
 and on your camera in the edition in 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.479
 Truth I think the 3d it beyond 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.330
 all without realizing it is the largest school 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.729
 of audiovisual production of beauty because 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 all the people who today 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.910
 work with us, we 've been through 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.910
 on here 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.110
 in fashion it is behavior is not 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.880
 social behavior 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 so you always have to go and get it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.530
 new knowledges 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.300
 the person has to have cultural baggage 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.340
 to be able to make the most of it really 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.750
 sometimes I think I 'm missing 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.000
 I would like people to do more 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.120
 this is love 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.120
 I think it's the main thing is love 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 What are you doing in 17? 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 I think they are the main things
