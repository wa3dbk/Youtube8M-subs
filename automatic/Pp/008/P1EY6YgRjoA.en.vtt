00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.250 
games and comic books and that sort of
thing<00:00:20.180> we're<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.330> making<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> toy<00:00:21.869> or<00:00:21.990> magnet

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
thing we're not making a toy or magnet

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.290 
thing we're not making a toy or magnet
character<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.490> becomes<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.939> toy<00:00:24.119> that's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
character that then becomes a toy that's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.660 
character that then becomes a toy that's
really<00:00:24.689> important<00:00:25.109> because<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.430> about

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
really important because it's it's about

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.390 
really important because it's it's about
establishing<00:00:27.380> some<00:00:28.380> sort<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> foundation<00:00:29.250> on

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
establishing some sort of foundation on

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
establishing some sort of foundation on
which<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.910> build<00:00:30.090> something<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
which we can build something like the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.100 
which we can build something like the
happy<00:00:31.500> Sherpa<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.610> made<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.719> conjunction

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
happy Sherpa that we made in conjunction

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
happy Sherpa that we made in conjunction
with<00:00:34.290> Space<00:00:34.710> Camp<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> great<00:00:35.550> example<00:00:35.640> all

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with Space Camp is a great example all

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
with Space Camp is a great example all
right<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.899> does<00:00:36.989> Basecamp<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:38.100> helps

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
right what does Basecamp do it helps

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.580 
right what does Basecamp do it helps
people<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.059> companies<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.989> guides<00:00:40.320> down

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
people and companies these guides down

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
people and companies these guides down
basically<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> process<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.790> whatever

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
basically to the process of whatever

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
basically to the process of whatever
projects<00:00:42.510> they're<00:00:42.600> working<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
projects they're working on so in that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
projects they're working on so in that
way<00:00:43.559> they're<00:00:44.430> they're<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> Sherpa<00:00:45.059> their

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
way they're they're a Sherpa their

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.729 
way they're they're a Sherpa their
guidance<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
guidance so that's really where that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
guidance so that's really where that
came<00:00:47.219> from<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.489> course<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> Jing<00:00:48.059> Basecamp

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
came from of course the Jing Basecamp

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
came from of course the Jing Basecamp
right<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.410> his<00:00:49.620> mom<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> natural

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
right and his mom so it was a natural

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.540 
right and his mom so it was a natural
fit<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> super<00:00:52.500> fun<00:00:52.800> example

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fit and I think it's a super fun example

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.849 
fit and I think it's a super fun example
of<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.820> do

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
of what we do

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.829 
of what we do
once<00:00:56.519> we<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.730> past<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> sketches<00:00:57.659> and

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
once we get past like the sketches and

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.200 
once we get past like the sketches and
final<00:00:58.320> sort<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> designs<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> patterning<00:01:00.030> we

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
final sort of designs and patterning we

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
final sort of designs and patterning we
basically<00:01:00.570> started<00:01:01.469> pinning<00:01:01.800> these<00:01:01.890> patterns

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
basically started pinning these patterns

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.770 
basically started pinning these patterns
onto<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> fabric<00:01:02.909> cutting<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.479> out<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.719> we

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
onto the fabric cutting it out so we

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
onto the fabric cutting it out so we
that<00:01:03.929> we<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.320> sew<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.030 

we're<00:01:11.940> not<00:01:12.060> doing<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.360> full<00:01:12.570> 3d<00:01:13.080> thing<00:01:13.770> looks

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we're not doing a full 3d thing looks

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
we're not doing a full 3d thing looks
like<00:01:14.130> basically<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.910> filiform<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.690> once<00:01:16.260> that's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like basically a filiform so once that's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130 
like basically a filiform so once that's
flipped<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.280> adhere<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> applique<00:01:18.480> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
flipped then we adhere the applique in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.930 
flipped then we adhere the applique in
this<00:01:19.380> case<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.800> sort<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.160> green<00:01:20.370> mask<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
this case it's sort of a green mask of

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.860 
this case it's sort of a green mask of
the<00:01:21.060> happy<00:01:21.330> Sherpa<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.000> attach<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.720> eyes

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
the happy Sherpa then we attach the eyes

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:35.319 
the happy Sherpa then we attach the eyes
and<00:01:25.200> even<00:01:25.440> stuff<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.280> body<00:01:26.490> cavity

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.550 

so<00:01:36.329> ready<00:01:36.539> that<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> Matheson's<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.380> place

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so ready that the Matheson's in place

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.529 
so ready that the Matheson's in place
the<00:01:37.770> eyes<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.000> stuffed<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
the eyes are on it's all stuffed in the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.029 
the eyes are on it's all stuffed in the
clothes<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> add<00:01:40.829> any

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
clothes so then we can add any

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.010 
clothes so then we can add any
additional<00:01:41.479> applicants<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
additional applicants that we have in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
additional applicants that we have in
this<00:01:43.110> case<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.130> curved<00:01:44.490> smile<00:01:44.880> mouth

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
this case it's that curved smile mouth

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.539 
this case it's that curved smile mouth
