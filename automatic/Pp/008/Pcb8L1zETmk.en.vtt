00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.060
 good evening have the users of the 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.670
 Latin Hispanic android community in this 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.800
 video we are going to flash a motorcycle very 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.740
 pretty for the samsung galaxy s 4g ty 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.260
 9,500 international version go name 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.060
 so long is not to say the octa core and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.730
 to cut it to that 47 9500 or version 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.370
 international opt for ok first thing 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.850
 what are we going to do 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:35.020
 my rum which I am currently using 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.640
 it's the rom one like I left a video 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.740
 where you can see the instructions 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.980
 paraphrase it a tutorial I'm going to leave you 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.380
 on this side of the screen if they want 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.530
 flashing the other of the best that 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.930
 has this rom is that by pressing the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.150
 restart option opens me now the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.970
 Recovery option and download mode 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.670
 that then I pulse record and I do not have to 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.250
 make the sequence of buttons towards 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.770
 above and below nor that of power but 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.820
 He directly takes me here 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.490
 we are very nice ok I'm going to 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.440
 indicate the name because there are several but 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 today I'm not particularly going to show you 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.130
 is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.310
 they're going to go where it says install from e 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 be installed from the second download 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.350
 I like I have the file saved in the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.260
 sd card 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.250
 I will use the last option that is chus from 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.590
 is external sd card and pressed the button 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.420
 power 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 and I have my files saved in 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.539
 this folder that says 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.420
 ok but you can save it in 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.579
 any other name is indistinct and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.950
 now going to look for the file that they are going to 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.079
 flash 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.570
 in this case it's called the one I'm going to 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:55.509
 use it goes truck icon 0.61 points and ok and 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.939
 let's give it the power button and now 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's find the option that says yes 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.740
 install truce with 0.60 and 1.7 and go to 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.869
 start the phrasing and I'll put it here 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.800
 close as you can see it does 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.600
 the dalvik white cache 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.790
 and good this is a relatively 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.090
 fast as you can see 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.760
 let's see who changes with 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.269
 regarding the original round there are a few 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.099
 nice aspects that I like 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.489
 so we customize our phone and 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.250
 it comes out a bit of the touchwiz style that 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.019
 although it is fluid has its details already 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.239
 is ready as you can see let's go 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.620
 back which is the last option and now 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.140
 let's go to the first one that is ebook 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.909
 sisterna ok and let's hope that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.150
 restart the computer if I'm not wrong 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:50.810
 open a list that is optimizing the 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.030
 applications 0 of x applications if not 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.569
 I'm wrong that you do not expect the team 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.430
 start 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.219
 remember that if you like my videos 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.519
 like to videos subscribe to 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.930
 channel follow me on my twitter and any 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.069
 doubt do in the bottom part of the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.040
 question box 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.620
 sorry can ask the questions that 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.819
 want in the video that you want 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.370
 ok there is no problem 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.439
 I almost dropped the camera the touch sing 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 unintentionally or as you can see it says 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:25.650
 optimizing application 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.360
 x of 235 as you can see already this change 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.360
 It is a different aspect 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.330
 The way I see it is nicer than the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.819
 that brings original touchwiz ok what 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.220
 What happens is that the torch wish is more than 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.530
 same that is very similar to the samsung 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.010
 galaxy s3 although it is improved there is 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.160
 to say it logical are not practically 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.180
 carbon-plated 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.860
 they changed the odd thing but it's still 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.630
 being the same as with this they are going to 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.180
 give a totally different air to your 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.520
 samsung galaxy s 4 and when a person 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.370
 see it then you will be surprised because 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.890
 the appearance will be different although the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.840
 phone as such is the hardware 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 it will be the same but the software can 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.410
 play a lot 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.660
 through these tutorials that I am 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.560
 giving ok already this phone is 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.560
 relatively new we already have 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.580
 a routing we have a modified recovery 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.100
 we have a round east houston install 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.800
 and now we will start installing other 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.520
 box ok as you can see 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.500
 Here where the phone says the phone is 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.650
 a samsung galaxy s 4 with the same 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.180
 little pictures of the balloons of the person 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.280
 I was jumping with the balloons 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.020
 where are you contacts as you can see 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.880
 they also change messages on the internet 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.870
 ok too 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.240
 in the menu if it's the same as when 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.520
 we unfold the window as you can see 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.940
 the icons from the wifi we are going to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.730
 Turn it on 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.730
 it is not the gps the sound are different 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.970
 of the bluetooth also if we click on 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:08.230
 adjustments you will see that it also changes what 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.160
 is the icons as you can see upload a 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.080
 little camera 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.150
 as I'm going to zoom in a bit like they can 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.790
 see my devices accounts plus everything 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.640
 this changes and it was noticed that there is the change 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.130
 when we open is here where they are 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.130
 all the buttons for quick access 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.070
 how can you see the smartphone and the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.290
 smart state you see the eye and it's very 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.120
 attractive the car mode is to say all 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.400
 the icons in quite attractive and 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.110
 they look different than me 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.640
 in particular, it calls me quite the 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:43.880
 attention ok good this has been the 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.280
 flashing the motorcycle true there is as key that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.040
 it looks quite different to the 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.560
 team and very flashy ok well you know 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.930
