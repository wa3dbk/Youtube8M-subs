00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
community Friday night and we are about

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.700 
community Friday night and we are about
30<00:00:47.160> hours<00:00:47.570> away<00:00:48.570> from<00:00:48.600> being<00:00:49.020> completely<00:00:49.559> done

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
30 hours away from being completely done

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.240 
30 hours away from being completely done
and<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.449> 16<00:00:51.449> hours<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.710> need<00:00:52.890> about

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and we have 16 hours so we need about

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
and we have 16 hours so we need about
double<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
double what we have is what I'm that's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
double what we have is what I'm that's
my<00:00:55.949> guess<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.239> people<00:00:58.020> coming<00:00:58.199> with

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
my guess so we have people coming with

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229 
my guess so we have people coming with
their<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.859> babies<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> someone<00:00:59.910> coming

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
their little babies and someone coming

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.459
