00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
with that actual location it's the first

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
with that actual location it's the first
area<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> where<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.230> your

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
area that you go to where you get your

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
area that you go to where you get your
first<00:00:49.620> shot<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.520> reduce<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> effects<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so after you've gone ahead and actually

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.479 
so after you've gone ahead and actually
went<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.469> save<00:00:55.680> zone<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.010> come<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.370> to
