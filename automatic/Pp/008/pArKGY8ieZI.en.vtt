 bite they have complaints and may hurt 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.800

 diction 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.810

 wonderful through on the facial and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.400
 and and besides that of course esthetics are very 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.110
 damaged in many cases let us 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.690
 now look at the examples on 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 pictures of what it looks like that is we 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.540
 today are used to what is being done 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.030
 plastic surgery but that's what we're talking about 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.519
 we say this is plastic surgery but 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.530
 art gnostic operation that is here 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.780
 this here is a charming girl who she is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.250
 this is the ideal of beauty that we all 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.549
 yet all women and men strive 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.060
 he is reaching today as you know 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.480
 woman to 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.540
 and this woman is the power of the left picture 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.510
 when she and in simple 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.500
 lip position they lip open and visible 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.370
 lips in a smile already you look very 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.840
 deep gums this situation is called 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.409
 vertical maxi mandrel and plant 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.639
 upper jaw 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:54.970
 what did you do to her 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:58.560
 the upper jaw needs to be shortened and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 put in position a little higher to hell and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.629
 put in order and very much in this 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.870
 case 9 this patient is on the left 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.939
 photography is when the situation is the opposite 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.840
 when in with a smile are not visible at all and 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:17.109
 upper teeth it gives a look very and 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.030
 elderly old old person and here under 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.389
 api in this case we did the operation 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.030
 which we put in the opposite position and 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.370
 and lengthen through set lower 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.720
 the position of the upper jaw and then 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 put and with a smile already 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.819
 this this is a completely different person what 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.250
 that is, we still have a picture 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.680
 child whose nominated 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.630
 put forward the bottom of something to watch this 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.300
 depending on how we look or lower 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.620
 advanced or upper in reverse 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.920
 reverse position and these are such situations 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.250
 usually not genetic and in such a way 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.640
 case of course we do the analyzes 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.150
 taking pictures with models from doing an operation in 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.420
 which 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.050
 and we put the jaws of the century in their not normal 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.980
 position but here I would like to ask here 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.810
 understandable when a person goes 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.080
 plastic surgeon wants to tighten 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.270
 face ears and so on something better and 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.150
 In this case, the pictures that we 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.730
 have seen this people who have pathology 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.010
 two questions do they pay these 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.440
 procedures and at what age can 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.840
 whether to make such a procedure at all 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.100
 scars after this procedure or how 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.210
 the person will usually look you in our 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.850
 at the Israeli box office 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.160
 so far as with aesthetics and not 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.270
 paid spit need it every 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.600
 should pay give yourself 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.169
 but when patients come complaining 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.820
 that and complain of a joint or 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.070
 problem of survival in such problems and how 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.169
 as if not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.110
 concerns no no problem with aesthetics 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.650
 so in such cases pays extra and 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.419
 Spit and this operation is again low 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.750
 commission that really decides 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.790
 or really not their complaint 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.590
 reasonably or so far as you 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.490
 have to do such operations arm 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:14.260
 full of beaks to go without fear but in our 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.400
 hospital we do a year of operation 30 is 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.100
 complex pen 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.770
 these operations which again we must 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.340
 determine the most need it in these 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.030
 operations 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.250
 make 2-2 jaws and upper and lower and 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.030
 average operation 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.320
 one jaw takes about two hours 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.620
 if it is two jaws about four hours 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.960
 we do activates possible from man 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.710
 with problems in appearance up 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.710
 turn into a beautiful 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.840
 young healthy person here of course 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.500
 that we consult the family doctor and 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.530
 even with the psychologist of the fact that this is all 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.320
 in meat with a nutritionist usually after 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.780
 these operations do not close your mouth 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.140
 jaw splinting for several weeks 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.270
 and diet is safe here gay yes and eve and after 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.180
 operations about a few 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.710
 months until it takes all the soft tissue already 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.600
 and becomes in a new position and already 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:25.250
 it becomes normal what he say your 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.160
 patients and well usually most 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.470

 backlight which is really not very 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.870
 would be a dramatic change was in the 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.270

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.660
 somehow does not understand that she is not they she 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.790
