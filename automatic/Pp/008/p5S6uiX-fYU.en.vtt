you<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.720> equip<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.680> kills

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you do not have to equip it it kills

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
you do not have to equip it it kills
everybody<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> map<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> basically<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
everybody on the map and basically it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.679 
everybody on the map and basically it
EMPs<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> enemy<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.610> about<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> minute<00:01:24.360> maybe

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
EMPs the enemy for about a minute maybe

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.100 
EMPs the enemy for about a minute maybe
45<00:01:25.229> seconds<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.990> modern<00:01:27.990> warfare

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
45 seconds it's not like modern warfare

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
45 seconds it's not like modern warfare
3<00:01:28.290> where<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> lasts<00:01:29.159> longer<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.490> only

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
3 where I think it lasts longer is only

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.850 
3 where I think it lasts longer is only
about<00:01:29.700> 45<00:01:30.060> seconds<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> minute<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.079> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
about 45 seconds or a minute and but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
about 45 seconds or a minute and but
yeah<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.100> still<00:01:32.250> fun<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.909> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
yeah it's still fun to get it's just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
yeah it's still fun to get it's just
it's<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.930> important<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.890> just

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it's not that important but it's just

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980
