you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.740 

from<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.050> very<00:00:36.200> beginning<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:37.790> ipad<00:00:38.540> was

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
from the very beginning the ipad was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.930 
from the very beginning the ipad was
designed<00:00:39.200> to<00:00:39.530> be<00:00:39.650> very<00:00:39.730> powerful<00:00:40.730> very

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
designed to be very powerful very

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.160 
designed to be very powerful very
capable<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:42.800> also<00:00:43.540> remarkably<00:00:44.540> simple<00:00:44.870> to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
capable but also remarkably simple to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.140 
capable but also remarkably simple to
use

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
use

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.350 
use
so<00:00:48.140> our<00:00:48.320> goal<00:00:48.620> was<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.430> take<00:00:49.610> all<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.970> amazing

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
so our goal was to take all the amazing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.540 
so our goal was to take all the amazing
things<00:00:50.630> that<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.620> can<00:00:51.800> do<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.100> full-size

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
things that you can do the full-size

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.000 
things that you can do the full-size
iPad<00:00:53.060> but<00:00:53.660> pack<00:00:53.960> them<00:00:54.140> into<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.410> product<00:00:54.920> that

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
iPad but pack them into a product that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.270 
iPad but pack them into a product that
is<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:55.610> much<00:00:55.850> smaller<00:00:56.060> and<00:00:56.890> that's<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.160> we

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
is so much smaller and that's what we

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.200 
is so much smaller and that's what we
did<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.330> new<00:00:59.450> ipad<00:00:59.840> mini<00:01:01.000> one<00:01:02.000> of<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
did with the new ipad mini one of the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.210 
did with the new ipad mini one of the
things<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.450> makes<00:01:02.630> iPad<00:01:02.990> so<00:01:03.260> incredible<00:01:03.740> is

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
things that makes iPad so incredible is

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.920 
things that makes iPad so incredible is
that<00:01:04.280> there's<00:01:04.970> almost<00:01:05.120> no<00:01:05.449> end<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.780> what<00:01:05.840> you

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
that there's almost no end to what you

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.860 
that there's almost no end to what you
can<00:01:06.020> do<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.970> when<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.210> decided<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.630> make<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.970 

before<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:11.900> had<00:02:12.049> done<00:02:12.319> was<00:02:12.590> take<00:02:12.799> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
before that we had done was take the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.000 
before that we had done was take the
original<00:02:13.430> iPad<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.060> just<00:02:14.329> reduce<00:02:14.659> it<00:02:15.010> all

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
original iPad and just reduce it all

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.850 
original iPad and just reduce it all
that<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.400> would<00:02:16.549> be<00:02:16.700> aware<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.200> was<00:02:18.200> was

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
that you would be aware of was was

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.289 
that you would be aware of was was
everything<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.430> was<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.730> missing<00:02:19.939> that

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
everything that was just missing that

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.160 
everything that was just missing that
there<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.959> inherent<00:02:21.200> loss<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:23.269> reducing

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
there is inherent loss in just reducing

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.179 
there is inherent loss in just reducing
a<00:02:24.260> product<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:24.829> size<00:02:25.329> on<00:02:26.329> what<00:02:26.569> we<00:02:26.780> did<00:02:27.140> was<00:02:28.040> we

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
a product in size on what we did was we

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.740 
a product in size on what we did was we
went<00:02:28.310> back<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.670> very<00:02:28.819> beginning<00:02:29.359> and<00:02:29.480> we

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
went back to the very beginning and we

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.170 
went back to the very beginning and we
took<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.170> time<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:31.129> design<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> product<00:02:31.939> that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
took the time to design a product that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.259 
took the time to design a product that
was<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.769> concentration<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.549> reduction

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
was a concentration of not a reduction

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.920 
was a concentration of not a reduction
of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.540> original<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:37.730> felt<00:02:38.000> strongly<00:02:38.420> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
of the original we felt strongly that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.979 
of the original we felt strongly that
seven<00:02:39.739> point<00:02:40.010> nine<00:02:40.069> inches<00:02:40.640> was<00:02:41.329> exactly<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
seven point nine inches was exactly the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.979 
seven point nine inches was exactly the
right<00:02:42.200> display<00:02:42.650> size<00:02:43.060> but<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> became<00:02:44.510> clear

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
right display size but it became clear

that<00:02:45.349> we<00:02:45.859> had<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.190> reduce<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.700> width<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.329> the

that we had to reduce the width of the
