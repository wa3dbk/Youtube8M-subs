you in their system those are the ways
you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.200> there's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> lot<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you can do it so there's a lot of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
you can do it so there's a lot of
variety<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.700> depending<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.420> what

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
variety out there depending on what

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.240 
variety out there depending on what
works<00:02:03.990> best<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.040> good<00:02:05.219> some

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
works best for you some are good some

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
works best for you some are good some
are<00:02:05.549> bad<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.570> know

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
are bad you know

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.100 
are bad you know
so<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.250> depends<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.989> know

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so it really depends on you you know

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.660 
so it really depends on you you know
what<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.890> would<00:02:11.039> most<00:02:11.190> value

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
because it let me do it at my own pace

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.190 
because it let me do it at my own pace

for me personally I was actually working
another<00:02:25.470> job<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.920> time<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> was<00:02:26.370> making<00:02:26.489> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
another job at the time I was making a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.089 
another job at the time I was making a
career<00:02:26.940> change<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.530> allowed<00:02:28.739> me<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.069> up

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
career change so it allowed me to go up

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.009 
career change so it allowed me to go up
my<00:02:29.250> own<00:02:29.370> pace<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:30.510> affordable

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
my own pace was a little more affordable

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.220 
my own pace was a little more affordable
and<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.830> was<00:02:31.980> able<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.690> absorb<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> knowledge

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and I was able to absorb the knowledge

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.000 
and I was able to absorb the knowledge
as<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.549> could<00:02:35.760> given<00:02:36.390> my<00:02:36.569> busy<00:02:36.840> schedule

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
as I as I could given my busy schedule

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.380 
as I as I could given my busy schedule
so<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.459> for<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.879> worked<00:02:39.060> out<00:02:39.180> great

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so I that for me that worked out great

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.839 
so I that for me that worked out great
for<00:02:40.319> you<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> money<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
for you if you have the money and you

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.559 
for you if you have the money and you
can<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.090> someplace

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
can go someplace

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.330 
can go someplace
I<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:43.140> hands-on<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.709> probably<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
I think hands-on is probably one of the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.360 
I think hands-on is probably one of the
best<00:02:44.519> ways<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.890> don't<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
best ways to do it but if you don't and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
best ways to do it but if you don't and
you<00:02:47.730> would<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> little<00:02:48.810> bit<00:02:48.930> more
