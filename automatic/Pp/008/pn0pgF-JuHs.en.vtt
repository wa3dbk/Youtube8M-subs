00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
unfortunately so it doesn't look very

Thor<00:02:49.760> supposed<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.150> be<00:02:50.240> big<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.840> works

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
Thor supposed to be big so that works

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.490 
Thor supposed to be big so that works
this<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.310> based<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.760> modern<00:02:53.090> Thor<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:54.170> it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
this is based on the modern Thor and it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.170 
this is based on the modern Thor and it
looks<00:02:54.680> just<00:02:54.800> like<00:02:55.010> him<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.460> would<00:02:55.610> say<00:02:55.790> I'm

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
looks just like him I would say I'm

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.990 
looks just like him I would say I'm
pretty<00:02:57.170> pleased<00:02:57.500> overall<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> best

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
pretty pleased overall not the best

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.570 
pretty pleased overall not the best
figure<00:02:59.330> ever<00:02:59.540> he's<00:03:00.110> got<00:03:00.380> relatively<00:03:01.280> big

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
figure ever he's got relatively big

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.430 
figure ever he's got relatively big
joints<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.090> he<00:03:02.150> doesn't<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.570> most<00:03:03.170> pose

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
joints so he doesn't have the most pose

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
joints so he doesn't have the most pose
ability<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.490> he<00:03:04.580> could<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> little<00:03:05.180> bit

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
ability and he could have a little bit

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.940 
ability and he could have a little bit
more<00:03:05.480> paint<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:05.990> shading<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.500> hands<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
more paint like shading on the hands and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.820 
more paint like shading on the hands and
face<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.220> stuff<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> Cape<00:03:08.830> another

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
face and stuff and on the Cape another

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.260 
face and stuff and on the Cape another
thing<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.190> would<00:03:10.370> kind<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.640> like<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.940> Cape<00:03:11.150> to

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
thing I would kind of like the Cape to

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.420 
thing I would kind of like the Cape to
be<00:03:11.300> longer<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.140> relatively<00:03:12.620> short<00:03:12.980> for<00:03:13.190> Thor

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
be longer it's relatively short for Thor

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.360 
be longer it's relatively short for Thor
but<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.780> doable<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.740> can<00:03:15.890> live<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
but it's doable you can live with it I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.240 
but it's doable you can live with it I
guess<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.510> not<00:03:17.600> too<00:03:17.780> bad<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.830> there's<00:03:19.070> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
guess so it's not too bad so there's the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.150 
guess so it's not too bad so there's the
comic-con<00:03:19.910> exclusive<00:03:20.120> Thor<00:03:20.810> very<00:03:21.530> similar<00:03:21.980> to

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
comic-con exclusive Thor very similar to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.250 
comic-con exclusive Thor very similar to
the<00:03:22.940> door<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.420> will<00:03:23.480> be<00:03:23.600> getting<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.900> retail

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
the door that will be getting a retail

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.680 
the door that will be getting a retail
in<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.500> little<00:03:24.709> while<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:26.030> only<00:03:26.270> difference<00:03:26.450> is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
in a little while the only difference is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.699 
in a little while the only difference is
the<00:03:26.810> pain<00:03:27.050> so<00:03:27.680> if<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.640> can't<00:03:28.910> um<00:03:29.590> didn't<00:03:30.590> have

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
the pain so if you can't um didn't have

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.260 
the pain so if you can't um didn't have
somebody<00:03:30.920> get<00:03:31.250> one<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.670> at<00:03:31.790> comic-con<00:03:32.120> or
