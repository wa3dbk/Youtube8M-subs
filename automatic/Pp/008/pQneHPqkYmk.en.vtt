00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.320
 with the recent appearance in the market 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.900
 of the 2011 3 shock associated with the chipset 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 x 99 different brands have 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.380
 presented its products for the same 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 as usual in these 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.830
 releases 13 components have the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.560
 lucky to have different models 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 for your analysis and today we bring you two of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.770
 those that more and will have available for 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.810
 all of you the x 99 s gaming 7 and the x 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.520
 99 that's the plus 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.380
 the software contained boat that bet 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.900
 for gaming and is that it has brought its 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.110
 most popular series since the show that 1250 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.520
 until the new 2011 3 with gaming 7 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.440
 we find a team that counts 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.920
 with a refined design together with a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 Full battery features 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 the red and black color predominates in everything 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.230
 its surface and includes its well-known 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.450
 dragon in the heads in 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.440
 but regardless of the design they import their 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.480
 Specifications 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.579
 and is that as the main feature of this 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.730
 new socket we find support 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.230
 for memories ddr3 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.450
 count as the main characteristic 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.240
 with a higher speed with respect to ddr3 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.190
 and above all, its low consumption 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.200
 located at 12 watts 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.630
 7 gaming will be able to support up to 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.630
 a total of 128 GB at a frequency 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 maximum of 3,333 megahertz of course 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.159
 making the relevant 12 for 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.409
 make them work at that frequency 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.030
 if this was not enough, this 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.670
 new chip has been implemented one of the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.770
 news of 197 and is that it includes a 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.259
 esata express port together with 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.179
 a turbo media port that has 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.900
 a theoretical speed of 32 gigabytes 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.510
 per second 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.360
 besides you must not forget that you can not 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.280
 used simultaneously both ports 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.230
 In this sense, you will also find 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 with 8 additional sata 3 ports 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.250
 If this will not thought enough 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 brand wanted to equip 7 with gaming 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.820
 many of the specifications that are 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.470
 can be found in this range as per 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.510
 audio post 2 technology example 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.080
 compatible with the shadows sound of 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.120
 cinema 2 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.070
 this technology incorporates the circuit 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.840
 air separated from the rest so from 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.670
 this way we will be able to avoid possible 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.710
 interference if this has not seemed 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.850
 and enough audio dose has been 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.010
 properly protected from 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.060
 electromagnetic interference 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.790
 counting on high trainers 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 quality a headphone amplifier and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.220
 how could it be less connectors than 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.590
 gold-plated back audio 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 to complete the audio section the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.250
 brand wanted to make sure that the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.680
 power on the usb port be 5 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.960
 watts compared to the 4.6 we usually 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.490
 find usually in this way 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.810
 we make sure there are no losses in 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.580
 the sound quality if we are 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 using a usb headset 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 There is no doubt that both killer with his 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.160
 gigabit network card 2200 as 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.920
 ps 2 and 2 usb ports intended for 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 gaming peripherals could not miss and is 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.190
 that these characteristics are being 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.800
 something usual in the ms gaming series 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.280
 quad sli crossfire thanks to its four 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.770
 pci express ports 2 x 16 and 2 x 8 two 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.970
 pci express ports for 18 usb ports 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.630
 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports will complete the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.280
 connectivity section 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.870
 something that also characterizes 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.940
 this series is the inclusion of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.320
 possibilities of overclock and that is 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.510
 although it is not up to others 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.890
 models intended for this task yes that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.400
 will offer you possibilities that we 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.040
 will provide the same multi-button button 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.140
 clear buttons are integrated in the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.580
 moby and a bio is very intuitive you 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.480
 will allow to carry out an overclock 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.480
 moderate to your team 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.920
 but if what we are looking for is a plate without 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.030
 design flourishes and without 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.670
 characteristics that the east 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.710
 especially to the world gamer la x 99 sl 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.010
 plus can become your choice 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.010
 purchase 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.250
 little or nothing to reproach this 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.530
 model and that is that we find a 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.280
 plate that stands out for its sobriety 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.710
 betting on the black in all 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.330
 surface the manufacturer has wanted 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.310
 clearly differentiate your series 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.720
 gaming and is that this model does not incorporate 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.800
 none of the network technologies or 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.260
 audio that is so that includes 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.420
 as usual in the chipset x 99 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 the express sata ports and the port of 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.530
 m2 turbo will be present in all this 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.850
 generation as it happens with the 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.550
 memory ddr 4 la x 99 sl plus will support 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.080
 up to a total of 128 gb to 3300 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.580
 megahertz 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.689
 a way that is something by the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.819
 features that mimic the model 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.740
 analyzed above is practically 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.740
 the same motherboard as it incorporates 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.370
 four ports pci express 2 x 8 and 2 x 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.919
 16 2 ports pci express x 1 and 8 ports 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.810
 sata 3 likewise happens with your 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.759
 connectivity and that is that we will have in their 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.319
 rear a total of 8 usb ports 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.240
 3.0 2 usb 2.0 ports and one card 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.090
 sound that incorporates five connectors and 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.039
 optical output your network card though 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.039
 it's not killer, it's gigabyte 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.180
 two really interesting plates and that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.370
 we have found them very similar except for 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.870
 the target audience of gaming 7 and the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.389
 traditional characteristics that this 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.110
 incorporates something that will of course suppose 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.150
 a higher price 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.140
 you can already find both models in the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.140
 web pc components
