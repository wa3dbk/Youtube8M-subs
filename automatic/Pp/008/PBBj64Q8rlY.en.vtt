00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
function one exposure group I'm going to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.090 
function one exposure group I'm going to
rotate<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:59.000> large<00:00:59.270> rotary<00:01:00.230> control<00:01:00.680> wheel<00:01:00.920> it

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.610 
rotate the large rotary control wheel it
goes<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.399> each<00:01:01.520> one<00:01:01.850> but<00:01:02.360> then<00:01:02.630> I'm<00:01:02.899> going<00:01:03.590> to

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
goes to each one but then I'm going to

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.319 
goes to each one but then I'm going to
get<00:01:03.829> into<00:01:04.009> that<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.759> control<00:01:05.149> by

pressing the set button and you'll see
right<00:01:07.399> now<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:08.299> can<00:01:08.479> move<00:01:08.659> between<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.229> two<00:01:09.259> or

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
right now we can move between the two or

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.160 
right now we can move between the two or
more<00:01:09.770> selections<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.630> item<00:01:12.020> and

more selections in that that item and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.139 
more selections in that that item and
when<00:01:12.799> we<00:01:12.950> decide<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.579> want<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.969> we're<00:01:14.090> gonna

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
when we decide we want it we're gonna

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.670 
when we decide we want it we're gonna
hit<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.420> set<00:01:14.780> button<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.259> first<00:01:15.469> one<00:01:15.649> is

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
hit that set button so the first one is

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.920 
hit that set button so the first one is
exposure<00:01:16.280> level<00:01:16.579> increments<00:01:17.000> what<00:01:17.540> this<00:01:17.719> is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
exposure level increments what this is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.620 
exposure level increments what this is
is<00:01:18.170> how<00:01:18.799> fine<00:01:19.189> of<00:01:19.460> an<00:01:19.640> increment<00:01:20.060> you're<00:01:20.540> gonna

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
is how fine of an increment you're gonna

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.390 
is how fine of an increment you're gonna
have<00:01:20.900> when<00:01:21.080> you're<00:01:21.200> adjusting<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
metering in the camera so you're in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.080 
metering in the camera so you're in
manual<00:01:24.200> mode<00:01:24.260> or<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.590> B<00:01:24.740> or<00:01:24.920> T<00:01:25.130> V<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.490> moving

your make your control dials this will

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.649 
your make your control dials this will
actually<00:01:28.010> give<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.430> finer<00:01:29.360> or<00:01:29.479> coarser

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
actually give you a finer or coarser

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.200 
actually give you a finer or coarser

once<00:03:19.129> I'd<00:03:19.250> turn<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.670> off<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.879> bring<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> back

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
once I'd turn it off and bring it back

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.030 
once I'd turn it off and bring it back
on<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> default<00:03:21.019> is<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.379> on<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:23.739> number<00:03:24.739> 5

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
