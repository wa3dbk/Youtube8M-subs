00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 it's windows 8 it's still 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.639
 windows 8 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.380
 that's windows 8 too and that's 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.309
 windows 8 even though it looks great 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.309
 at windows 7 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 it's the biggest change ever 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 undergone by windows it is a key point 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.199
 in the new orientation of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 microsoft that values ​​mobility the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.859
 data synchronization 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 the touch and the speed that the edges of 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 the screen are active than your evenings on 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.570
 a touch screen a touchpad or even a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.610
 good old mouse 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 there are a lot of activities that it is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.100
 on the start screen or in a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.630
 application 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 that's good because it maximizes 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 the space on the screen for the association 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 but it can also disturb you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.430
 and even annoyed you before you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.930
 be accustomed the bar is a map 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.030
 important part it interacts 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.809
 simultaneously with the home screen and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.399
 applications 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 that's where you 're looking for documents 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.760
 and apps that you share that you 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 control devices and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.270
 configure application options 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 default applications are solid 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.930
 and interactive not always a 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.690
 optimal layout but it proposes 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 a lot of content it's hard to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.810
 differentiate hidden functions 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.490
 behind an overflow and those that make 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 part of the application this can be 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 a little disturbing you the tiles 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 allow you to easily see the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.340
 updates and can be turned off if 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 you find that too chaotic 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.920
 microsoft did not give us much 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 of time to test this rtm version 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.759
 and the timing and the air of good 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 walk with the apps and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 some non microsoft accounts used 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.579
 a crosoft conflict is waiting for more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 settings for passwords at 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.840
 photo diary and apps 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 the office looks a lot like windows 7 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.040
 but without the translucent border the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.509
 touch functions respond very well 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.700
 even when you touch words 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 Precise is a space for your elders 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 software that you can access more 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.829
 of traditional windows settings 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 many meat applications 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.320
 directly from subway to office windows 8 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.640
 answers more questions about 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.439
 the future of windows that want in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.710
 leave out the addresses yet 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.420
 some important unknowns his 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.040
 synchronization will she keep all 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.140
 our settings and applications to 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.130
 files accessible by sky drive but 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.409
 even more important 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 he asks for an apprenticeship what is 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.009
 this a big risk for microsoft 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.660
 I think it works but that it 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.580
 will not come back 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.070
