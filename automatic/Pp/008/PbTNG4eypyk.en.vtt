00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
intensive trapping class we're gonna be

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
intensive trapping class we're gonna be
out<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.810> six<00:00:19.020> days<00:00:19.350> trapping<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:20.460> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
out for six days trapping in some of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
out for six days trapping in some of
these<00:00:20.609> areas<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.180> gonna<00:00:21.300> pull<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.720> lot<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
these areas so I'm gonna pull a lot of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.960 
these areas so I'm gonna pull a lot of
my<00:00:22.260> traps<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.100> gonna<00:00:23.220> try<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:23.820> new

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
my traps out and I'm gonna try some new

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
my traps out and I'm gonna try some new
traps<00:00:24.269> today<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.920> are

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
traps today and what these are these are

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.810 
traps today and what these are these are
dog<00:00:26.699> proof<00:00:27.230> raccoon<00:00:28.230> traps<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
dog proof raccoon traps and the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.700 
dog proof raccoon traps and the
simplicity<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.570> setting<00:00:31.050> these<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
simplicity of setting these things is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.060 
simplicity of setting these things is
what<00:00:31.859> makes<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.790> great<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.829> very<00:00:34.829> rarely

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
what makes them so great and very rarely

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.470 
what makes them so great and very rarely
are<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> gonna<00:00:35.430> catch<00:00:35.730> anything<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.329> but

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
are you gonna catch anything in here but

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
are you gonna catch anything in here but
a<00:00:36.510> coon<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.559> raccoons<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.340> curious

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
a coon because raccoons are very curious

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.100 
a coon because raccoons are very curious
animals<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.360> stick<00:00:39.600> their<00:00:39.719> hands<00:00:39.930> down

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
animals are gonna stick their hands down

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.619 
animals are gonna stick their hands down
into<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.219> get<00:00:41.399> bait<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.480> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
into things to get bait and the way this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
into things to get bait and the way this
thing<00:00:42.840> works<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.219> push<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> door

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
thing works is you just push the door

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
thing works is you just push the door
back<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.840> spring-loaded<00:00:46.469> door<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
back a spring-loaded door that's in the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
back a spring-loaded door that's in the
front<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.270> push<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> back

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
front you push that back and on the back

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.260 
front you push that back and on the back
side<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> set<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
side you can see there's a set of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.990 
side you can see there's a set of
whiskers<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.610> push<00:00:53.820> those

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
whiskers in here and you just push those

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
whiskers in here and you just push those
whiskers<00:00:54.239> forward<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.410> connects<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> latch

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
whiskers forward and it connects a latch

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.279 
whiskers forward and it connects a latch
and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> animal<00:00:57.600> sticks<00:00:57.870> his<00:00:58.079> hand

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and then when the animal sticks his hand

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
and then when the animal sticks his hand
down<00:00:58.500> inside<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.190> trap<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> bait<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
down inside this trap to get the bait in

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.619 
down inside this trap to get the bait in
the<00:01:00.930> back<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.469> hits<00:01:01.859> these<00:01:02.010> whiskers<00:01:02.629> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the back and hits these whiskers it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
the back and hits these whiskers it
closes<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.229> his<00:01:04.470> hand<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.159> he<00:01:05.220> can't<00:01:05.460> get

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
closes around his hand and he can't get

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
closes around his hand and he can't get
back<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> simple<00:01:07.500> chain<00:01:07.740> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
back out and it's got a simple chain on

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
back out and it's got a simple chain on
it<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.939> piece<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:10.260> know

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it it's just a piece of you know

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
it it's just a piece of you know
rectangle<00:01:10.920> stock<00:01:11.189> basically<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> collar

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
rectangle stock basically with a collar

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.969 
rectangle stock basically with a collar
on<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.080> gonna<00:01:13.170> show<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
on it but I'm gonna show you how this

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
on it but I'm gonna show you how this
really<00:01:14.280> simple<00:01:14.610> today<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.360> simple<00:01:15.750> way

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
really simple today a really simple way

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
really simple today a really simple way
to<00:01:15.900> use<00:01:16.080> bait<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.500> set<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.490> can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to use bait to set this thing you can

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
to use bait to set this thing you can
put<00:01:17.790> these<00:01:17.909> traps<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> ground<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.840> about

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
put these traps in the ground in about

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
put these traps in the ground in about
two<00:01:19.200> minutes<00:01:19.320> per<00:01:19.890> set<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.939> had<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> bunch

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
two minutes per set if you had a bunch

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
two minutes per set if you had a bunch
of<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.170> fairly<00:01:22.380> expensive<00:01:22.560> they

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
of these they are fairly expensive they

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
of these they are fairly expensive they
are<00:01:23.040> fairly<00:01:23.340> heavy<00:01:23.659> compared<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:24.930> traps

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
are fairly heavy compared to other traps

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
are fairly heavy compared to other traps
but<00:01:25.860> they're<00:01:26.070> bullet<00:01:26.460> proof<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
but they're bullet proof in a lot of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
but they're bullet proof in a lot of
ways<00:01:27.299> compared<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:27.960> traps<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.740> let's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
ways compared to other traps so let's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
ways compared to other traps so let's
walk<00:01:29.100> down<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.430> creek<00:01:29.670> bed<00:01:29.700> I'll<00:01:30.390> show<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
walk down this creek bed I'll show you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.700 
walk down this creek bed I'll show you
where<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> set<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
where I'm going to set this one up and

so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> traps<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.540> was

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
so that was one of the traps I was

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.990 
so that was one of the traps I was
planning<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.899> pulling<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.409> may<00:01:56.219> reset<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> one

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.120 
planning on pulling I may reset that one
or<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> may<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:57.899> put<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.350> trap<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.740> its<00:01:58.890> place

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
or I may just put this trap in its place

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980 
or I may just put this trap in its place
well<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> minute

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
