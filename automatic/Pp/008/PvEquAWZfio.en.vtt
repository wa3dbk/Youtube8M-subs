throughout the whole video and wondering
how<00:05:22.960> I<00:05:22.990> got<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.440> it's<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.889> number<00:05:24.130> three<00:05:24.370> or

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
how I got it it's a number three or

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.670 
how I got it it's a number three or
sorry<00:05:25.300> it's<00:05:25.449> number<00:05:25.690> two<00:05:25.870> it's<00:05:26.050> called<00:05:26.260> smooth

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
sorry it's number two it's called smooth

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.770 
sorry it's number two it's called smooth
board<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:27.970> lets<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.330> scroll

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
board and it just lets you scroll

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.480 
board and it just lets you scroll
through<00:05:28.810> your<00:05:29.080> icons<00:05:29.530> sideways<00:05:29.979> without<00:05:30.310> it

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
through your icons sideways without it

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.180 
through your icons sideways without it
locking<00:05:30.970> into<00:05:31.120> each<00:05:31.330> page<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:32.020> do<00:05:32.349> like<00:05:32.950> that<00:05:32.979> a

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
locking into each page I do like that a

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.430 
locking into each page I do like that a
lot<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.639> think<00:05:33.849> it<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:34.360> makes<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.169> look<00:05:35.349> a

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
lot I think it like makes it look a

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.800 
lot I think it like makes it look a
little<00:05:35.590> nicer<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:36.310> lot<00:05:36.700> smoother<00:05:37.210> it's<00:05:37.690> all

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
little nicer a lot smoother it's all

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.870 
little nicer a lot smoother it's all
about<00:05:38.050> like<00:05:38.229> sort<00:05:38.470> of<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> momentum<00:05:39.370> stuff

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
about like sort of the momentum stuff

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.080 
about like sort of the momentum stuff
like<00:05:40.030> that<00:05:40.240> momentum<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.669> number<00:05:42.669> one<00:05:42.849> guys

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
like that momentum and number one guys

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.200 
like that momentum and number one guys
like<00:05:43.450> I<00:05:43.570> said<00:05:43.750> this<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.200> no<00:05:44.440> order<00:05:44.940> but<00:05:45.940> I

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
like I said this is in no order but I

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.110 
like I said this is in no order but I
know<00:05:46.270> rotate<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.500> gonna<00:05:47.800> be<00:05:47.979> my<00:05:48.160> another<00:05:48.880> one

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
know rotate is gonna be my another one

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.560 
know rotate is gonna be my another one
of<00:05:49.240> my<00:05:49.300> favorite<00:05:49.750> tweaks<00:05:50.260> or<00:05:50.410> mods<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:51.570> let's

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
of my favorite tweaks or mods and let's

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.279 
of my favorite tweaks or mods and let's
check<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:52.930> out

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
check it out

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.969 
check it out
so<00:05:54.220> what<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:54.639> rotate<00:05:55.180> lets<00:05:55.510> you<00:05:55.660> do<00:05:55.979> click

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
so what I know rotate lets you do click

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.150 
so what I know rotate lets you do click
on<00:05:57.160> right<00:05:57.370> here<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:58.030> allows<00:05:58.300> you<00:05:58.539> to<00:05:59.160> enable

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
on right here it allows you to enable

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.890 
on right here it allows you to enable
different<00:06:00.520> applications<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:01.539> that<00:06:01.750> they

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
different applications so that they

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.350 
different applications so that they
don't<00:06:02.169> rotate<00:06:02.620> on<00:06:03.039> you<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:03.370> for<00:06:03.789> an<00:06:03.849> example<00:06:04.150> if

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
don't rotate on you so for an example if

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.659 
don't rotate on you so for an example if
I<00:06:04.479> turn<00:06:04.750> my<00:06:04.840> iPod<00:06:05.169> this<00:06:05.440> way<00:06:05.650> you<00:06:06.220> know<00:06:06.310> I<00:06:06.340> don't

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
I turn my iPod this way you know I don't

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.670 
I turn my iPod this way you know I don't
want<00:06:06.910> one<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.389> my<00:06:07.570> applications<00:06:08.229> to<00:06:08.410> turn

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
want one of my applications to turn

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.710 
want one of my applications to turn
sideways<00:06:09.039> because<00:06:09.639> you<00:06:10.060> know<00:06:10.180> sometimes<00:06:10.570> I'm

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
sideways because you know sometimes I'm

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.450 
sideways because you know sometimes I'm
lying<00:06:10.930> down<00:06:11.139> or<00:06:11.349> something<00:06:11.560> I'm<00:06:11.800> watching<00:06:12.250> I

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
that and you don't actually want the

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.029 
that and you don't actually want the
video<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.479> turn<00:06:19.900> sideways<00:06:20.229> something<00:06:20.889> like

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
video to turn sideways something like

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:21.480 
video to turn sideways something like
that

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
that

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.730 
that
I<00:06:21.520> know<00:06:21.849> rotate<00:06:22.389> is<00:06:22.539> the<00:06:22.720> best<00:06:22.930> application<00:06:23.560> to

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
I know rotate is the best application to

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.320 
I know rotate is the best application to
stop<00:06:24.070> that<00:06:24.550> from<00:06:24.820> happening

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
stop that from happening

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.150 
stop that from happening
