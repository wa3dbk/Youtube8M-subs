good-sized man in his handshake is a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.259 
good-sized man in his handshake is a
good<00:00:10.050> handshake<00:00:10.429> and<00:00:11.429> he<00:00:11.580> came<00:00:11.759> into<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.059> room

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
good handshake and he came into the room

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
good handshake and he came into the room
and<00:00:12.330> he<00:00:12.540> said<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> lady<00:00:13.110> said<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:14.370> pleased

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and he said I lady said I'm very pleased

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.689 
and he said I lady said I'm very pleased
with<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:16.500> procedure<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.070> we've<00:00:17.220> done<00:00:17.430> he

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
with the procedure that we've done he

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.240 
with the procedure that we've done he
said<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:20.090> 99.999%<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.769> gave<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> big

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
said it's 99.999% and I just gave a big

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.259 
said it's 99.999% and I just gave a big
smile<00:00:24.949> because<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> unique<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
smile because of the unique and the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
smile because of the unique and the
difficult<00:00:27.750> challenging<00:00:28.439> situation<00:00:29.160> we

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
difficult challenging situation we

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
difficult challenging situation we
really<00:00:29.910> used<00:00:30.119> everything<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.230> knew<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
really used everything that we knew to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
really used everything that we knew to
try<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> treat<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> combination

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
try to treat them that is a combination

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510 
try to treat them that is a combination
of<00:00:33.600> both<00:00:33.840> our<00:00:34.410> technique<00:00:35.010> through<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
of both our technique through the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
of both our technique through the
vessels<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> dr.<00:00:36.540> Wallace's<00:00:37.050> technique<00:00:37.469> by

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
vessels and dr. Wallace's technique by

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.119 
vessels and dr. Wallace's technique by
opening<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.370> brain<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> looking<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
opening the brain and looking at it and

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.369 
opening the brain and looking at it and
and<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.730> were<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:43.140> edges

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and so we were really at the very edges

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.850 
and so we were really at the very edges
of<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.399> offer<00:00:44.520> our<00:00:44.730> patients<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
of what we can offer our patients the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
of what we can offer our patients the
treatment<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.610> avms<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.719> ABF's<00:00:49.350> has

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
treatment for avms and ABF's has

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
treatment for avms and ABF's has
traditionally<00:00:50.489> involved<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> combination

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
traditionally involved the combination

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.709 
traditionally involved the combination
of<00:00:51.840> embolization<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.980> brain<00:00:53.520> surgery<00:00:54.059> this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.529 
of embolization and brain surgery this
team<00:00:55.020> approach<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.620> expanded<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.370> 1970<00:00:57.360> in
