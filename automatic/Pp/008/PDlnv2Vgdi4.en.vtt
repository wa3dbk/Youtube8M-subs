is actually officially over now I knew I

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
is actually officially over now I knew I
wanted<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.269> do<00:00:15.420> overviews<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:15.990> each<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
wanted to do overviews of each of the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.920 
wanted to do overviews of each of the
classes<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.340> i<00:00:17.550> went<00:00:17.940> ahead<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.180> i<00:00:18.390> recorded

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
classes so i went ahead and i recorded

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960 
classes so i went ahead and i recorded
footage<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.529> each<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.340> saved<00:00:20.760> them

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
footage for each one and I saved them

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.550 
footage for each one and I saved them
now<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.480> didn't<00:00:21.869> actually<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.380> much

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
now I didn't actually have as much

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.230 
now I didn't actually have as much
footage<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.340> thought<00:00:23.609> I'd<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> till<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
footage as I thought I'd it till this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.450 
footage as I thought I'd it till this
this<00:00:24.720> video<00:00:25.019> isn't<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.350> amazing<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.279> far

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
this video isn't really amazing as far

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.160 
this video isn't really amazing as far
as<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> gameplay<00:00:27.029> goes<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.779> but

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
as the gameplay goes it's all right but

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.259 
as the gameplay goes it's all right but
just<00:00:28.199> keep<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.769> mind<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.789> far<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
just keep that in mind now as far as the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
just keep that in mind now as far as the
support<00:00:30.630> class<00:00:30.750> itself<00:00:31.289> goes<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.610> many

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
support class itself goes I like many

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
support class itself goes I like many
other<00:00:33.210> people<00:00:33.630> did<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.079> play<00:00:34.500> support<00:00:34.950> very

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
other people did not play support very

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
other people did not play support very
much<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> battlefield<00:00:36.000> 3<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.750> generally

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
much in battlefield 3 it was generally

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
much in battlefield 3 it was generally
considered<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> useless

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
considered to be a little on the useless

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
considered to be a little on the useless
side<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> things<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.230> when<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> jumped<00:00:41.070> into

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
side of things and when I jumped into

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.910 
side of things and when I jumped into
battlefield<00:00:41.760> 4<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> thought<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:42.809> okay<00:00:43.290> i'm

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
battlefield 4 I thought first okay i'm

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
battlefield 4 I thought first okay i'm
gonna<00:00:44.129> give<00:00:44.340> support<00:00:44.730> another<00:00:45.000> chance<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
gonna give support another chance and

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
gonna give support another chance and
just<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> completely<00:00:47.309> fresh

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
just going to it with a completely fresh

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
just going to it with a completely fresh
mindset<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.539> I'll<00:00:48.690> tell<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> actually

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
mindset and I'll tell you I actually

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
mindset and I'll tell you I actually
really<00:00:49.710> enjoyed<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.760> support<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.510> all

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
really enjoyed it now support is by all

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
really enjoyed it now support is by all
means<00:00:51.930> definitely<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> salt<00:00:53.250> class

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
means definitely not in the salt class

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.520 
means definitely not in the salt class
till<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.180> support<00:00:54.570> guns<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.170> very

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
till the if support guns are not very

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
till the if support guns are not very
good<00:00:55.770> close<00:00:56.010> range<00:00:56.309> which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.210> expected

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
good close range which is to be expected

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.540 
good close range which is to be expected
I<00:00:57.960> mean<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.800> map<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.309> playing

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I mean on this map that I'm playing

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.150 
I mean on this map that I'm playing
right<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
right now it was a little not it was not

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.380 
right now it was a little not it was not
the<00:01:02.309> best<00:01:02.430> choice<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.850> probably<00:01:03.090> should<00:01:03.329> have

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the best choice I probably should have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
the best choice I probably should have
gone<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.809> salt<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.290> engineer<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> just

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
gone with a salt or engineer but I just

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920 
gone with a salt or engineer but I just
really<00:01:05.309> wanted<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> give<00:01:05.790> support<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.420> chance

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
really wanted to give support a chance

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
really wanted to give support a chance
on<00:01:07.170> such<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> small<00:01:07.920> map<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> generally<00:01:08.790> worked

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
on such a small map it generally worked

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
on such a small map it generally worked
better<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.360> game<00:01:10.080> modes<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.409> conquest<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
better on game modes like conquest and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
better on game modes like conquest and
obliteration<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> much

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
obliteration just because it's a much

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
obliteration just because it's a much
more<00:01:13.439> team-oriented<00:01:14.070> game<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.180> hand

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
more team-oriented game and you can hand

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
more team-oriented game and you can hand
out<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.750> ammo<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.590> utilize<00:01:16.890> your

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
out that ammo and you can utilize your

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
out that ammo and you can utilize your
bipod<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> lock<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.240> areas<00:01:18.689> now<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> first

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bipod to lock down areas now the first

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
bipod to lock down areas now the first
weapon<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.030> support<00:01:21.600> class

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
weapon that you get as the support class

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.200 
weapon that you get as the support class
in<00:01:21.990> battlefield<00:01:22.470> 4<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> beta<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.670> least<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
in battlefield 4 in the beta at least is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.679 
in battlefield 4 in the beta at least is
the<00:01:24.350> mk5<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.250> mk5<00:01:26.729> didn't<00:01:27.150> really<00:01:27.420> feel

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the mk5 now the mk5 didn't really feel

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.080 
the mk5 now the mk5 didn't really feel
like<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.990> true<00:01:28.650> light<00:01:29.100> machine<00:01:29.460> gun<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> felt<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like a true light machine gun it felt a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
like a true light machine gun it felt a
little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.350> assault<00:01:31.860> rifle

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
little bit more like an assault rifle

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.740 
little bit more like an assault rifle
which<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.520> good<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> makes<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
which is good because that makes it a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
which is good because that makes it a
good<00:01:33.900> introductory<00:01:34.680> support<00:01:35.610> weapon<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.450> the

mk5 performed reasonably well on this

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
perform that well in full automatic I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
perform that well in full automatic I
was<00:01:43.170> having<00:01:43.439> much<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.710> luck<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.759> tap

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
was having much more luck when I was tap

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
was having much more luck when I was tap
firing<00:01:45.360> or<00:01:46.079> even<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.439> burst<00:01:46.740> fire<00:01:47.009> mode<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
firing or even in burst fire mode I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580 
firing or even in burst fire mode I
found<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.880> gun<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.540> took<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> large

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
found that this gun really took a large

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
found that this gun really took a large
hit<00:01:49.950> from<00:01:50.310> sustained<00:01:50.939> automatic<00:01:51.659> fire<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
hit from sustained automatic fire and I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
hit from sustained automatic fire and I
didn't<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.439> find<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.250> that

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
didn't really find it to be all that

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.539 
didn't really find it to be all that
useful<00:01:54.000> now<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> larger<00:01:55.590> Maps<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.979> did<00:01:56.159> find<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
useful now a larger Maps I did find the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
useful now a larger Maps I did find the
mp5<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:57.930> useful<00:01:58.350> though<00:01:58.530> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
mp5 to be a little more useful though I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
mp5 to be a little more useful though I
still<00:01:58.979> found<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> automatic<00:01:59.820> fire<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.270> not

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
still found that automatic fire was not

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.050 
still found that automatic fire was not
the<00:02:00.810> best<00:02:00.990> approach<00:02:01.229> now<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.430> reason<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the best approach now the reason I think

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
the best approach now the reason I think
I<00:02:03.149> found<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> better<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> mp5

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
I found it better was because the mp5

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 
I found it better was because the mp5
works<00:02:05.340> better<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.240> most<00:02:06.479> support<00:02:06.899> guns<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
works better like most support guns it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.740 
works better like most support guns it
works<00:02:07.590> better<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.610> mid<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.090> long<00:02:09.270> distance

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
works better from mid to long distance

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.410 
works better from mid to long distance
because<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.200> close<00:02:10.530> support<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
because up close support is not that

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
because up close support is not that
great<00:02:12.720> against<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> solver

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
great against the solver

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
great against the solver
fools<00:02:13.920> because<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.400> salt<00:02:14.610> rifles<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.510> is

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
fools because the salt rifles that is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
fools because the salt rifles that is
their<00:02:15.870> niche<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.320> are<00:02:16.440> designed<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.010> kill

their niche they are designed to kill

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.310 
their niche they are designed to kill
things<00:02:17.430> up<00:02:17.670> close<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.210> support<00:02:18.660> frankly<00:02:19.170> is

things up close and support frankly is

things up close and support frankly is
not<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> second<00:02:20.910> gun<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.300> was

not now the second gun that was

actually<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.940> footage<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.930> type<00:02:28.110> 88<00:02:28.440> in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
actually have footage of the type 88 in

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.530 
actually have footage of the type 88 in
this<00:02:28.980> video<00:02:29.370> but<00:02:29.670> i<00:02:29.700> will<00:02:29.970> tell<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> i<00:02:30.300> enjoyed

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this video but i will tell you i enjoyed

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.800 
this video but i will tell you i enjoyed
the<00:02:31.140> 88<00:02:31.500> much<00:02:31.980> more<00:02:32.340> than<00:02:32.580> i<00:02:32.670> did<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.030> mk5<00:02:33.540> in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the 88 much more than i did the mk5 in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.110 
the 88 much more than i did the mk5 in
almost<00:02:34.050> every<00:02:34.440> sense<00:02:34.770> now<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.460> reason<00:02:35.760> for

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
almost every sense now the reason for

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120 
almost every sense now the reason for
this<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.330> quite<00:02:36.900> simply<00:02:37.230> put<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
this is quite simply put is that the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.300 
this is quite simply put is that the
type<00:02:38.430> 88<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> much<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.810> traditional<00:02:40.310> light

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
type 88 is a much more traditional light

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580 
type 88 is a much more traditional light
machine<00:02:41.670> gun<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.970> has<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.330> larger<00:02:43.110> magazine

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
machine gun it has the larger magazine

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.070 
machine gun it has the larger magazine
size<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.280> has<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.670> longer<00:02:45.120> reload<00:02:45.510> time<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
size it has the longer reload time it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.230 
size it has the longer reload time it
has<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> higher<00:02:46.890> rate<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> fire<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.000> just

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
has the higher rate of fire it is just

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.120 
has the higher rate of fire it is just
generally<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> more<00:02:48.990> strictly<00:02:49.830> speaking

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
generally a more strictly speaking

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.660 
generally a more strictly speaking
support<00:02:50.850> gun<00:02:51.090> whereas<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.960> mp5<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.610> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
support gun whereas the mp5 is kind of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.450 
support gun whereas the mp5 is kind of
like<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.820> support<00:02:54.330> /<00:02:54.720> assault<00:02:55.170> rifle<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.310> I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
like a support / assault rifle now as I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.850 
like a support / assault rifle now as I
said<00:02:56.520> previously<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.450> mk5<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.350> generally<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
said previously the mk5 is generally a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.000 
said previously the mk5 is generally a
more<00:02:59.520> beginner<00:03:00.240> oriented<00:03:00.960> support<00:03:01.740> weapon

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
more beginner oriented support weapon

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
more beginner oriented support weapon
now<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.910> type<00:03:03.150> 88<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.840> what<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.350> come<00:03:04.650> to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
now the type 88 is what I have come to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.770 
now the type 88 is what I have come to
expect<00:03:05.070> from<00:03:05.310> support<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.600> what<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
expect from support so that is what I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.960 
expect from support so that is what I
enjoyed<00:03:07.320> more<00:03:07.650> I'm<00:03:07.890> used<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.580> support

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
enjoyed more I'm used to the support

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
enjoyed more I'm used to the support
weapon<00:03:09.180> having<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.200> large<00:03:10.590> ammo<00:03:11.100> capacity

in<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.090> high<00:03:12.270> rate<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.540> fire<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.260> mp5<00:03:14.160> just

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
in that high rate of fire the mp5 just

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.280 
in that high rate of fire the mp5 just
felt<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.790> little<00:03:14.820> underwhelming<00:03:15.780> because<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
felt a little underwhelming because it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.130 
felt a little underwhelming because it
is<00:03:16.440> good<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> few<00:03:17.580> things<00:03:17.790> bad<00:03:18.600> some<00:03:18.960> other

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140

is good at a few things bad some other
things<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.650> doesn't<00:03:19.800> really<00:03:20.070> shine<00:03:20.490> in<00:03:20.820> any

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
things it doesn't really shine in any

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.450 
things it doesn't really shine in any
one<00:03:21.210> area<00:03:21.270> so<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.350> why<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:23.160> enjoyed

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
one area so that is why I really enjoyed

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.900 
one area so that is why I really enjoyed
the<00:03:23.700> type<00:03:23.910> 88<00:03:24.270> lmg<00:03:24.900> much<00:03:25.680> more<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.190> than<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.580> did

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
the type 88 lmg much more so than I did

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.390 
the type 88 lmg much more so than I did
the<00:03:27.060> mk5<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.260> moving<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.710> let's<00:03:28.830> take<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> look

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the mk5 so moving on let's take a look

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400 
the mk5 so moving on let's take a look
at<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.700> gadgets<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.510> support<00:03:30.900> class<00:03:31.050> had

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
at the gadgets the support class had

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.900 
at the gadgets the support class had
available<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:32.010> them<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.490> have<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> ammo

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
available to them now they have the ammo

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.300 
available to them now they have the ammo
bag<00:03:33.240> which<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.630> an<00:03:34.080> ammo<00:03:34.620> bag<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.100> can

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
bag which is an ammo bag that you can

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.430 
bag which is an ammo bag that you can
throw<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.700> an<00:03:36.060> ally<00:03:36.360> or<00:03:36.600> yourself<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
throw to an ally or yourself and that

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.950 
throw to an ally or yourself and that
gives<00:03:37.830> back<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.460> clip<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.850> ammo<00:03:39.150> now<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.570> think

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
gives back one clip of ammo now I think

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.740 
gives back one clip of ammo now I think
this<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.410> kind<00:03:40.710> of<00:03:40.830> cool<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:41.490> mean<00:03:41.700> as<00:03:42.150> far

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
this is kind of cool but I mean as far

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.810 
this is kind of cool but I mean as far
as<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.170> ammo<00:03:43.440> box<00:03:43.770> goes<00:03:44.040> i<00:03:44.280> found<00:03:44.490> the<00:03:44.580> ammo

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
as the ammo box goes i found the ammo

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.480 
as the ammo box goes i found the ammo
box<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.210> be<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.600> lot<00:03:46.080> more<00:03:46.110> useful<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:47.160> because

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
box to be a lot more useful just because

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.850 
box to be a lot more useful just because
it<00:03:47.670> restores<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.420> lot<00:03:48.840> more<00:03:49.020> ammo<00:03:49.380> i'm<00:03:49.530> not<00:03:49.680> sure

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
it restores a lot more ammo i'm not sure

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.770 
it restores a lot more ammo i'm not sure
how<00:03:50.070> they<00:03:50.310> will<00:03:50.460> change<00:03:50.760> this<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.390> maybe<00:03:51.540> make

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
how they will change this to maybe make

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.050 
how they will change this to maybe make
the<00:03:51.930> ammo<00:03:52.200> bag<00:03:52.380> more<00:03:52.620> viable<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.880> is

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
the ammo bag more viable but that is

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.880 
the ammo bag more viable but that is
just<00:03:54.090> my<00:03:54.390> experience<00:03:54.660> with<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.290> now<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.710> next

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
just my experience with it now the next

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.520 
just my experience with it now the next
gadget<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.300> air<00:03:57.570> burst<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.230> air

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
gadget was the air burst now the air

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530 
gadget was the air burst now the air
burst<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.160> very<00:03:59.610> interesting<00:04:00.030> weapon

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
burst is a very interesting weapon

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.990 
burst is a very interesting weapon
because<00:04:01.050> not<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.860> lot<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.400> people<00:04:02.580> including

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
because not a lot of people including

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.360 
because not a lot of people including
myself<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:04.050> understood<00:04:04.620> how<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.920> use<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.340> i

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
myself really understood how to use it i

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.910 
myself really understood how to use it i
think<00:04:05.490> most<00:04:06.330> people<00:04:06.780> myself<00:04:07.080> included<00:04:07.440> were

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
think most people myself included were

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.710 
think most people myself included were
just<00:04:08.130> using<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.550> like<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:08.880> grenade<00:04:09.150> launcher

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
just using it like a grenade launcher

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.020 
just using it like a grenade launcher
and<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:10.890> how<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.130> gun<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.520> intended

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and that is not how the gun is intended

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.940 
and that is not how the gun is intended
to<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.150> used<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.780> way<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.990> can<00:04:13.350> actually<00:04:13.770> use

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
to be used the way you can actually use

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.640 
to be used the way you can actually use
it<00:04:13.980> if<00:04:14.310> someone<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.060> behind<00:04:15.180> cover<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:16.350> hip

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
it if someone is behind cover you hip

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.010 
it if someone is behind cover you hip
fire<00:04:16.920> look<00:04:17.370> at<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.580> cover<00:04:17.850> zoom<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
fire look at the cover zoom in on the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.349 
fire look at the cover zoom in on the
cover<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.830> aim<00:04:20.010> above<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.670> cover<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.209> then

cover you aim above the cover and then

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.050 
cover you aim above the cover and then
when<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.660> fire<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.770> shots<00:04:23.400> will<00:04:23.669> actually

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
when you fire the shots will actually

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.270 
when you fire the shots will actually
detonate<00:04:24.630> about<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:24.990> meter<00:04:25.350> after<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.040> cover

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
detonate about a meter after the cover

mechanics<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.250> airburst<00:04:35.580> was<00:04:35.850> one<00:04:36.120> of<00:04:36.210> my

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
mechanics so the airburst was one of my

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.060 
mechanics so the airburst was one of my
favorite<00:04:36.750> gadgets<00:04:37.199> night<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.470> lot<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.860> fun

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
favorite gadgets night a lot of fun

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.550 
favorite gadgets night a lot of fun
using<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.840> other<00:04:40.080> thing<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.380> I

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
using that so the other thing that I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.110 
using that so the other thing that I
kind<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.800> missed<00:04:41.040> about<00:04:41.400> support<00:04:41.820> was<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
kind of missed about support was the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.270 
kind of missed about support was the
lack<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.360> c-4<00:04:42.990> but<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.470> am<00:04:43.590> almost<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.190> hundred

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
lack of c-4 but I am almost one hundred

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.700 
lack of c-4 but I am almost one hundred
percent<00:04:44.460> sure<00:04:44.820> we<00:04:45.150> will<00:04:45.389> be<00:04:45.540> having<00:04:45.720> c4<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
percent sure we will be having c4 in the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.530 
percent sure we will be having c4 in the
final<00:04:47.040> launch<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> game<00:04:47.669> now<00:04:47.880> keep<00:04:48.449> in
