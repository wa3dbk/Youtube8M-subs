00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello we're all here in minecraft 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.249
 erum called defenses and this version 1.1 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.780
 5.1 this new version that already in the 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.209
 previous and announcement that you have to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.290
 update because the next mods were going 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.600
 to be of this update and nothing what 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.050
 I tried everything is to forgive putting previous the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.650
 video because I put the video was of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 textures then animated and then I gave 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.589
 account of how good that they removed 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.120
 the link we could not download or 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.120
 nothing so 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.890
 so I'm not sorry if you're going back to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.720
 upload to a topic these I would put it in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 the link of the previous life and that's it 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 good but the main thing that you have the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 haiti course in bonn loader for 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.879
 this version that we are going to serve quite 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.090
 at the time of when to upload all those 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.780
 three boats is worth it that contains this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.320
 mod it contains as you can see these 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.540
 these shields and these swords are worth 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.270
 we have always had an armor 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.910
 pretty good you are here but 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 well we have never had anything that we 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 defend butt is to say that we do not 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.100
 remove at least and a heart then with 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.869
 this with this shield we're going to take 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 example this is the best we can 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.410
 defend ourselves from everything and can be 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.060
 Arrows expressions of arrows 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.670
 archers and others know they had to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.860
 put them like that and we 're going to catch 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 um 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.570
 archer a zombie 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.890
 so let's put zombies 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.830
 fix 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.730
 So you see, they take away half a heart every 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.020
 every zombie well with this 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:15.600
 you see a bar is created above but if you 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.600
 is living the bar above him 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.730
 of the food you see that is filled when 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.810
 they do not hit us and they do not hurt us 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.260
 none in the armor or anywhere 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.930
 you see 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.299
 when it reaches the maximum it does not let you 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.659
 to defend yourself is not to leave you 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.659
 moment 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.310
 but one of the good things also that 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.580
 before it did not happen 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.470
 I think that when I said escape 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.230
 all unemployed are left before this does not 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.450
 I was passing 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.000
 and I think it 's pretty good because 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.470
 always had something first something 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 Well, it's going to be filled 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.180
 to bring survival I never just play in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.740
 your life just always play in creative and 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.740
 good they have left me 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.310
 do not 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:25.080
 is following and then we have here already 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.360
 the same but that is with a sword every 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.320
 Once you can defend yourself you can 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.240
 attack let's put the game mode is 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.880
 that the you tell me have not yet taken 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.450
 persuasion 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.930
 you see this is the same to get to 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.939
 where are we going to see 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.900
 notice that I can not block 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.650
 because this is going a little save 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.159
 here it really takes my life but at the time 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.159
 to paste 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.620
 You see elusive too 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.170
 the second touch no longer dodges or is 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.080
 On the one hand, it's good because you can 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.600
 attack while dodging but for 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.500
 another is bad because the second time 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.239
 they touch you, they take away a piece of life 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.590
 and well, the function is quite 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.040
 easy that what is done this that I do not 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.040
 follow this 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.880
 let's say 6 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.710
 Well, I'm seeing what's going on later and 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.440
 how these saviors are created 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.210
 it's very easy to really be one of the 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.580
 that I have easier than there are going to 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.000
 look for the poster table that is by 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.710
 here 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.430
 right here and we take the fundamental thing that 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.430
 it's the skin 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.710
 and already according to what you want to make place 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.710
 I do not have him 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.750
 you tell me if I have to take these 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.580
 stuff worth imagine 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.030
 as this is done, all are done 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.030
 same 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.089
 how it gets 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.089
 and then here 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.009
 m 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.640
 look then this will look otherwise 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.660
 nothing happens to me what they have done is done 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.700
 everything more messy 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.730
 a moment I left 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.360
 if one of them 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.360
 wood weapon 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.270
 you do not have to pull everything with a bunch 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.390
 let's see if you have tomatoes I take it and if 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.390
 is 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:07.110
 is that it is more difficult to build 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:16.030
 the saga 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.430
 and it's kind of this if it's like that 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.229
 would come out the wooden one and according to another 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.110
 craft it out in another and 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.340
 others how I like that and it's made of wood 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.430
 supposedly 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.070
 I imagine that it will break right away and the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.630
 defense would be very much less so 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.530
 nothing does not contain many other things 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.210
 it only includes these swords and these 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.070
 shields the truth that quite tenths 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.389
 of shields as you can see more than 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.090
 swords and nothing that's all they 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.949
 I write you can improve the swords 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.919
 the testers and you can and the shields 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:55.750
 same but good sir but you and 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:58.090
 nothing you already know to be a point 5.1 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:03.360
 and it works with the mode with the pit 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.360
 so nothing a greeting and goodbye
