00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.090
 welcome to a puntocom teacher 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.080
 this video we will explain the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.080
 basic elements 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 specifically the projection planes 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.980
 of these 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.030
 the space in which we can 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.950
 work and represent any 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.790
 element that is considered within the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.560
 technical drawing 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.310
 generally refers to space 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.170
 physical 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.750
 the geographical space or the space 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.280
 exterior can be understood in one place 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.280
 completely flat 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.289
 today in a three-dimensional place 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.470
 in this three-dimensional space I have 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 considered making a small model 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 in which you can see the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.320
 projection clear 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.370
 the horizontal plane 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.590
 vertical and the plane 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.510
 we will study this space 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.260
 later to be able to represent the 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.300
 different projections the different 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.460
 the different views that a 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.450
 object both metric and dimensional 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.860
 all right 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 then we will recover it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 the plane is a flat surface without 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.750
 thickness and can be shaped by a 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 line and a point 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 by three points 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 humans 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.440
 or by the intersection 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.830
 minimum of two lines 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.819
 drawing parallels 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.819
 we already have a plan for example 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.470
 in any these combinations 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.659
 the elements can be belonging 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.500
 to the same plane so you can 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.500
 form with them 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.080
 the point in geometry is one of the 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.840
 fundamental entities along with the straight 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.170
 of the plane are considered concepts 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 totally primary so it's just 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.690
 possible to describe them in relation to 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.270
 other elements 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.450
 totally similar as is the case with 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.390
 the straight or the plane 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.390
 the point is a geometric figure well 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.470
 a dimensional has no length 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.470
 does not have 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.110
 area that occupies an entire surface and 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.930
 neither has 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.930
 a volume simply 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.840
 needs the relationship of others 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.840
 describes a position 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.560
 any position that is in 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.560
 the interior of this space 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.939
 a totally determined space 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.350
 with respect to a coordinate system 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.290
 preset 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.879
 as you well know 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.159
 the coordinate system can be 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.560
 find and you are basically in 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.420
 mathematical mathematics that you can 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.030
 relate to drawing with music 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.040
 with everything in general 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.490
 as I described at the beginning 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.670
 are vertical coordinate axes 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.670
 the horizontal and the depth 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.880
 this is what we would understand as the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.880
 3-dimensional space in 3-d 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:50.469
 I hope that with this explanation we have 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.479
 come to the conclusion that it acts in 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.429
 this time we are going to 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.350
 focus on what space is 

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:57.840
 totally 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.100
 flat 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.100
 first be able to explain 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.810
 all those geometric figures 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.100
 flat and after evolving to 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.100
 space in three dimensions 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.300
 have you understood how you can 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.660
 act and on what surfaces we can 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.660
 perform
