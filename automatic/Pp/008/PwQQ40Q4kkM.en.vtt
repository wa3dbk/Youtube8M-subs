let's see how this little camera does

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.459 
let's see how this little camera does
its<00:00:48.539> work<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:49.850> have<00:00:50.850> tested<00:00:51.090> already<00:00:51.660> outside

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
its work I have tested already outside

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
its work I have tested already outside
inside<00:00:53.399> doors<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:55.890> seems<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> very

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
inside doors and it seems to do a very

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.439 
inside doors and it seems to do a very
good<00:00:56.789> job<00:00:57.050> although<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:59.489> looks<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.329> very

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
good job although it's it looks a very

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.920 
good job although it's it looks a very
simple<00:01:00.960> camera<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> simple<00:01:02.070> camera

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
simple camera or it is a simple camera

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.830 
simple camera or it is a simple camera
but<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.989> does<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.420> very<00:01:06.420> nice<00:01:06.630> quality

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
but it does have a very nice quality

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.010 
but it does have a very nice quality
within<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> same<00:01:07.770> zoom<00:01:08.010> keeps<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.490> mind<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
within that same zoom keeps in mind that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
within that same zoom keeps in mind that
it<00:01:10.020> keeps<00:01:10.320> track<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> its<00:01:10.830> nice<00:01:11.070> recording

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
