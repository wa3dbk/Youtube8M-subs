it's<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.489> even<00:00:44.789> funny<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:46.550> favorite

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's not even funny but my favorite

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.750 
it's not even funny but my favorite
blasters<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.329> narrowed<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> down<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.170> three

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
blasters and I narrowed it down to three

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
blasters and I narrowed it down to three
because<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.660> can't<00:00:51.960> pick<00:00:52.350> because<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.829> go

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
because I just can't pick because I go

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
because I just can't pick because I go
between<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.289> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
between these all the time because it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.119 
between these all the time because it
just<00:00:56.190> depends<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.640> who<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.910> fighting<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129

understand<00:03:22.620> why<00:03:22.709> they<00:03:22.830> put<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.130> guarantee

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
understand why they put that guarantee

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.830 
understand why they put that guarantee
to<00:03:23.640> hit<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.150> doesn't<00:03:24.480> always<00:03:24.660> work

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
but you can use it and it gives random

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.700 
but you can use it and it gives random
