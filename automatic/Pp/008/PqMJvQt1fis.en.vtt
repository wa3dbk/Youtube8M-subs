00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.359 

and<00:00:07.940> so<00:00:08.930> what<00:00:09.110> my<00:00:09.260> lab<00:00:09.500> is<00:00:09.740> interested<00:00:10.040> in

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:10.369 
and so what my lab is interested in

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:12.730 
and so what my lab is interested in
figuring<00:00:10.639> out<00:00:10.789> is<00:00:11.209> how<00:00:11.480> plant<00:00:11.959> cells<00:00:12.260> use

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
figuring out is how plant cells use

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.269 
figuring out is how plant cells use
those<00:00:13.070> pieces<00:00:13.459> the<00:00:14.059> proteins<00:00:14.629> the<00:00:15.110> all<00:00:16.100> the

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
those pieces the proteins the all the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.830 
those pieces the proteins the all the
different<00:00:16.580> parts<00:00:16.850> that<00:00:17.000> go<00:00:17.029> into<00:00:17.150> making<00:00:17.600> a

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
different parts that go into making a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.170 
different parts that go into making a
biosynthetic<00:00:18.199> pathway<00:00:18.920> and<00:00:19.190> what

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
biosynthetic pathway and what

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.600 
biosynthetic pathway and what
information<00:00:20.750> are<00:00:20.900> we<00:00:21.050> missing<00:00:21.350> that<00:00:22.250> we<00:00:22.400> need

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
information are we missing that we need

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.550 
information are we missing that we need
if<00:00:22.790> we're<00:00:22.910> going<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.090> be<00:00:23.300> clever<00:00:23.780> metabolic

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
if we're going to be clever metabolic

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.560 
if we're going to be clever metabolic
engineers<00:00:25.010> just<00:00:25.280> like<00:00:25.400> plants<00:00:25.760> are<00:00:25.910> we<00:00:26.390> know

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
engineers just like plants are we know

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.930 
engineers just like plants are we know
that<00:00:26.780> many<00:00:26.960> plants<00:00:27.470> make<00:00:27.760> pharmaceuticals<00:00:28.760> if

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
that many plants make pharmaceuticals if

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.990 
that many plants make pharmaceuticals if
you<00:00:29.090> will<00:00:29.500> but<00:00:30.500> what<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:30.770> don't<00:00:30.950> what<00:00:31.760> we<00:00:31.850> don't

you will but what we don't what we don't

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.830 
you will but what we don't what we don't
know<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:32.210> much<00:00:32.780> about<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:34.000> how<00:00:35.000> do<00:00:35.690> these

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
know is much about is how do these

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.170 
know is much about is how do these
plants<00:00:36.410> synthesize<00:00:37.130> these<00:00:37.310> compounds<00:00:37.970> and

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
plants synthesize these compounds and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.420 
plants synthesize these compounds and
how<00:00:38.300> is<00:00:38.450> it<00:00:38.480> came<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.350> be<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.739> plants<00:00:40.250> have

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
how is it came to be the plants have

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.790 
how is it came to be the plants have
evolved<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.120> capacity<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.960> make<00:00:42.620> this

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
evolved the capacity to make this

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.069 
evolved the capacity to make this

take advantage of that diversity of
natural<00:01:32.659> products<00:01:32.990> that's<00:01:33.200> produced<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:33.859> for

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
natural products that's produced so for

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.929 
natural products that's produced so for
instance<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.299> in<00:01:36.020> my<00:01:36.229> own<00:01:36.380> research<00:01:36.849> one<00:01:37.849> of

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
instance the in my own research one of

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.879 
instance the in my own research one of
the<00:01:38.029> compounds<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.719> I<00:01:38.779> work<00:01:38.990> on<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
the compounds that I work on is the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.499 
the compounds that I work on is the
basis<00:01:40.279> for<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.490> flavor<00:01:40.759> components<00:01:41.389> of

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
basis for the flavor components of

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.690 
basis for the flavor components of
mustard<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.229> wasabi<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.859> horseradish<00:01:43.279> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
mustard and wasabi and horseradish and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.499 
mustard and wasabi and horseradish and
so<00:01:44.389> there's<00:01:44.569> obviously<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.950> flavor<00:01:46.759> aspect<00:01:47.359> to

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
so there's obviously a flavor aspect to

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.929 
so there's obviously a flavor aspect to
that<00:01:47.539> what<00:01:48.169> I<00:01:48.200> really<00:01:48.859> want<00:01:49.069> to<00:01:49.219> do<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.669> to

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
that what I really want to do is to

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.469 
that what I really want to do is to
improve<00:01:50.450> plants<00:01:51.169> in<00:01:52.099> order<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.729> make<00:01:53.270> them

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
improve plants in order to make them

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.429 
improve plants in order to make them
grow<00:01:53.749> better<00:01:54.020> on<00:01:54.349> nitrogen<00:01:54.889> poor<00:01:55.219> soil<00:01:55.549> or

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
grow better on nitrogen poor soil or

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.239 
grow better on nitrogen poor soil or
make<00:01:57.439> them<00:01:57.590> export<00:01:58.249> more<00:01:59.409> nutrient<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:01.099> the

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
make them export more nutrient to the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.669 
make them export more nutrient to the
edible<00:02:01.669> part<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.239> plants<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.869> people

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
already affected too you know there's

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.560 
already affected too you know there's
already<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:17.370> lot<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.940> considerations<00:04:18.479> to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
already a lot of considerations to

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.120 
already a lot of considerations to
plants<00:04:18.930> such<00:04:19.079> as<00:04:19.109> how<00:04:19.530> are<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:19.709> going<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.889> feed

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
plants such as how are you going to feed

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.250 
plants such as how are you going to feed
the<00:04:20.579> future<00:04:20.790> over<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> next<00:04:21.479> 50<00:04:21.780> years<00:04:21.900> right

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the future over the next 50 years right

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.129 
the future over the next 50 years right
the<00:04:22.440> global<00:04:22.740> population<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.340> increasing<00:04:23.490> and

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
the global population is increasing and

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.379 
the global population is increasing and
our<00:04:25.139> food<00:04:25.919> supply<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.370> staying<00:04:26.880> somewhat

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
our food supply is staying somewhat

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.070 
our food supply is staying somewhat
finite<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.620> how<00:04:28.800> do<00:04:28.860> we<00:04:29.419> increase<00:04:30.419> plans<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
finite so how do we increase plans to

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:40.210 
finite so how do we increase plans to
meet<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.590> demands<00:04:32.160> for<00:04:32.310> future<00:04:32.970> generations
