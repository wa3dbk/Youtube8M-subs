00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.630
 face called chiffon same 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.300
 the scripts fit very well and simplicity 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.899
 because they have very beautiful 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.790
 the pore structure is very easy 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.160
 not cut into several layers to me 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:49.460
 crumbling 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:50.269
 today I will make chocolate 100 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.730
 gram flour 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.690
 teaspoon baking powder soda on 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.589
 knife tip 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 a pinch of salt 90 grams of fine sugar 30 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.510
 gram cocoa 2 3 tablespoons 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.750
 instant coffee 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.360
 90 milliliters of water 3 yolks 5 proteins and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.000
 30 grams of sugar for him sixty five 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.770
 milliliters of vegetable oil and so 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.440
 the first thing we need is need 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.180
 separate the whites from the yolks I sell you 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.760
 found a very interesting way 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.330
 maybe someone it is useful to you chat 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.060
 eggs need to be broken into a plate and when 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.390
 ordinary plastic bottle as 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.690
 would suck the yolk bottle itself squirrels 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.970
 stays on the plate the most important thing here 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.440
 do not break the yolk when you break 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.010
 that face is so easy and to the ledge 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010
