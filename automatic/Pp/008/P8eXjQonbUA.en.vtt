he's I think he's only really going to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.460 
he's I think he's only really going to
get<00:00:23.760> better<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.240> get<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> feel<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> team

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
get better as we get a feel for the team

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.740 
get better as we get a feel for the team
as<00:00:25.680> he<00:00:26.130> gets<00:00:26.310> better<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.849> speaking<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.359> english

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
as he gets better at speaking in english

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
as he gets better at speaking in english
but<00:00:28.080> i<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.949> fans<00:00:29.340> will<00:00:29.580> have

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
but i think that fans will have

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780 
but i think that fans will have
unreasonable<00:00:30.650> expectations<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> him<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
unreasonable expectations of him in the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.360 
unreasonable expectations of him in the
first<00:00:33.030> few<00:00:33.450> weeks<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.250> I'm

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
first few weeks and that's what I'm

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.680 
first few weeks and that's what I'm
worried<00:00:35.610> about<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:36.030> i'm<00:00:36.149> afraid<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
worried about because i'm afraid the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.819 
worried about because i'm afraid the
fans<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> come<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.530> him

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
fans are going to come down on him

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.459 
fans are going to come down on him
really<00:00:38.100> hard<00:00:38.399> we'll<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:39.719> he<00:00:39.750> performs

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
really hard we'll see how he performs

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
really hard we'll see how he performs

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
experience so that's a plus but well

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
experience so that's a plus but well
we'll<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.600> we'll<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> see

how<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.770> goes<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.280> definitely<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.120> not

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
how it goes it's definitely I would not

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.240 
how it goes it's definitely I would not
say<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.780> CLG<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> hundred<00:00:52.710> percent<00:00:52.890> yet

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
say that CLG is at a hundred percent yet

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.060 
say that CLG is at a hundred percent yet
that's<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.930> my<00:00:54.930> honest<00:00:55.469> opinion<00:00:55.860> from

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that's just my honest opinion from

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's just my honest opinion from

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
things ever since that I got into a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.249 
things ever since that I got into a
position<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.630> CLG<00:01:28.080> where<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.829> uh<00:01:30.259> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
position with CLG where we could uh I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
position with CLG where we could uh I
think<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.950> choices<00:01:32.280> made<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> team

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think the the choices made by the team

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
think the the choices made by the team
have<00:01:33.450> changed<00:01:34.400> since<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> joined<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
have changed since I joined the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.109 
have changed since I joined the
organization<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.680> now<00:01:38.400> when<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.909> pick

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
organization and that now when we pick

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.670 
organization and that now when we pick
somebody<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.799> we're<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.009> looking<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
somebody up we're really looking for a

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
somebody up we're really looking for a
solid<00:01:43.680> foundation<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.299> long-term

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
solid foundation for a long-term

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.990 
solid foundation for a long-term
solution<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.729> what<00:01:47.880> we're

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
solution and I think that's what we're

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.359 
solution and I think that's what we're
