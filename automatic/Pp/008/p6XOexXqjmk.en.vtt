00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.699 

we're<00:00:08.260> testing<00:00:08.740> a<00:00:08.950> new<00:00:09.600> design<00:00:10.600> for<00:00:10.629> a<00:00:11.080> rocket

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
we're testing a new design for a rocket

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.900 
we're testing a new design for a rocket
stove<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.840> have<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:15.299> air<00:00:16.299> coming<00:00:16.779> in<00:00:17.080> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
stove we have a air coming in to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.210 
stove we have a air coming in to
increase<00:00:18.910> the<00:00:19.090> combustion<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:20.920> now<00:00:21.160> we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
increase the combustion right now we

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.110 
increase the combustion right now we
haven't<00:00:21.610> got<00:00:21.790> it<00:00:22.090> started<00:00:22.480> but<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:24.970> what

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
haven't got it started but this is what

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.240 
haven't got it started but this is what
we<00:00:25.270> have<00:00:25.420> coming<00:00:25.750> out<00:00:25.990> of<00:00:26.200> the<00:00:26.400> chimney

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
we have coming out of the chimney

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.660 
we have coming out of the chimney
and<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:28.820> is<00:00:29.240> running<00:00:29.630> about<00:00:30.279> right<00:00:31.279> now

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.700 

running<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.260> 304<00:00:37.260> almost<00:00:37.800> 400<00:00:38.280> degrees

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
running about 304 almost 400 degrees

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:50.900 
running about 304 almost 400 degrees
check<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:44.000> 228<00:00:48.770> 462<00:00:49.770> towards<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
check it out here 228 462 towards the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.580 
check it out here 228 462 towards the
base

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.569 

there's<00:00:54.160> 500<00:00:54.910> degrees<00:00:55.270> with<00:00:55.539> no<00:00:55.719> air<00:00:56.020> being

there's 500 degrees with no air being

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.590 
there's 500 degrees with no air being
introduced<00:00:57.840> well<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:58.930> course<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:01.149> has<00:01:01.390> not

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
introduced well of course this has not

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.569 
introduced well of course this has not
been<00:01:01.629> insulated<00:01:02.410> yet<00:01:02.860> we're<00:01:03.100> going<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.309> put<00:01:03.550> a

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
been insulated yet we're going to put a

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.499 
been insulated yet we're going to put a
tank<00:01:03.940> around<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.750> insulate<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:06.509> hopefully

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
tank around it and insulate it hopefully

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.359 
tank around it and insulate it hopefully
we<00:01:07.900> don't<00:01:08.049> get<00:01:08.290> any<00:01:08.409> back<00:01:08.710> burn<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.190> that's

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
we don't get any back burn and that's

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.999 
we don't get any back burn and that's
what<00:01:09.550> I'm<00:01:09.670> concerned<00:01:09.820> about<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.720> back<00:01:11.560> burning

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
what I'm concerned about is back burning

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.670 
what I'm concerned about is back burning
on<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.159> pellets<00:01:12.670> here<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:14.380> we're<00:01:14.530> going<00:01:14.619> to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
on the pellets here but we're going to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.700 
on the pellets here but we're going to
run<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.040> till<00:01:15.220> we<00:01:15.340> see<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:16.570> pellets<00:01:16.990> drop<00:01:17.320> and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
run it till we see the pellets drop and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.730 
run it till we see the pellets drop and
then<00:01:17.860> we'll<00:01:18.299> add<00:01:19.299> some<00:01:19.360> air<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.470> see<00:01:20.649> if

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
then we'll add some air to it and see if

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.480 
then we'll add some air to it and see if
it'll<00:01:20.979> take<00:01:21.220> off<00:01:21.460> like<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> banshee

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.110 

you

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:02:38.440 

you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.210 

you<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.629> see<00:02:39.810> looking<00:02:40.230> down<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.769> combustion

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
you can see looking down the combustion

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.140 
you can see looking down the combustion
tube<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.379> see<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.799> Jets<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> bottom

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
tube you can see the Jets at the bottom

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.369 
tube you can see the Jets at the bottom
there<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:46.579> blow<00:02:47.579> on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.939> sides<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.569> convert

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
there that blow on the sides to convert

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.809 
there that blow on the sides to convert
to<00:02:50.159> make<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> vortex<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:52.170> also<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.790> have

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
to make a vortex and then also we have

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.300 
to make a vortex and then also we have
the<00:02:55.849> holes<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.299> top<00:02:57.930> which<00:02:58.560> blow<00:02:58.859> air<00:02:59.069> in

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the holes on the top which blow air in

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
the holes on the top which blow air in
after<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:01.370> combustion<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> shot

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
after the combustion this is a shot

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.619 
after the combustion this is a shot
looking<00:03:07.230> down<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.769> combustion<00:03:08.430> chamber<00:03:09.060> with

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
looking down the combustion chamber with

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.740 
looking down the combustion chamber with
the<00:03:09.780> great<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:11.030> pellet<00:03:12.030> drop<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.480> tubes

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
the great the pellet drop the tubes

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.160 
the great the pellet drop the tubes
coming<00:03:16.079> off<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.530> side<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:17.010> create<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> vortex

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
coming off the side that create a vortex

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.369 
coming off the side that create a vortex
as<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.440> bull<00:03:20.069> flame<00:03:20.340> comes<00:03:20.700> up<00:03:20.940> why<00:03:21.720> we

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
as this bull flame comes up why we

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.440 
as this bull flame comes up why we
introduce<00:03:22.769> more<00:03:23.099> air<00:03:23.310> which<00:03:23.700> gets<00:03:24.030> extremely

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
introduce more air which gets extremely

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.440 
introduce more air which gets extremely
hot<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:31.470> decided<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.129> build<00:03:32.310> an<00:03:32.579> auger<00:03:32.819> system

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
hot we decided to build an auger system

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.949 
hot we decided to build an auger system
due<00:03:34.409> to<00:03:34.439> the<00:03:34.650> fact<00:03:34.769> when<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.430> use<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:36.030> pellet

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
due to the fact when we use the pellet

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.770 
due to the fact when we use the pellet
drop<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.590> tube<00:03:37.889> it<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:39.000> fill<00:03:39.269> up<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
drop in the tube it would fill up and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.670 
drop in the tube it would fill up and
then<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.549> let<00:03:41.549> too<00:03:41.699> many<00:03:41.849> pellets<00:03:42.449> in<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
then when let too many pellets in and it

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.339 
then when let too many pellets in and it
would<00:03:44.030> consume<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.329> lot<00:03:45.599> of<00:03:45.629> pellets<00:03:46.109> real

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
would consume a lot of pellets real

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.119 
would consume a lot of pellets real
quick<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.730> decided<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.329> do<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.680> auger<00:03:49.680> and

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
quick so we decided to do a auger and

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.349 
quick so we decided to do a auger and
this<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.760> auger<00:03:50.970> here<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:52.769> will<00:03:53.359> rotate

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
this is the auger here this will rotate

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.539 
this is the auger here this will rotate
about<00:03:55.459> setting<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:57.389> have<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:57.780> test<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.549> air

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
about setting we have to test the air

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.680 
about setting we have to test the air
coming<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.209> from<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.480> bottom<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:01.109> the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
coming in from the bottom of the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.530 
coming in from the bottom of the
combustion<00:04:03.690> chamber<00:04:04.440> we<00:04:05.069> have<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.549> regulate

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
combustion chamber we have to regulate

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.339 
combustion chamber we have to regulate
the<00:04:06.810> feed<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.419> will<00:04:09.599> be<00:04:09.780> through<00:04:10.049> just

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
the feed and this will be through just

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.490 
the feed and this will be through just
testing<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.370> temperature<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:13.109> that's<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
testing the temperature so that's the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.709 
testing the temperature so that's the
latest
