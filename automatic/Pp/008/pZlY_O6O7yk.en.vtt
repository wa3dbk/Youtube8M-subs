00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
reason not really too sure why I know

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.650 
reason not really too sure why I know
he's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> dog<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.489> what<00:02:09.030> does<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.539> do

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
he's a dog but what does that have to do

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
he's a dog but what does that have to do
with<00:02:09.780> anything<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.890> his<00:02:11.009> in-game<00:02:11.280> stuff

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
with anything this is his in-game stuff

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820 
with anything this is his in-game stuff
this<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> him<00:02:12.810> versus<00:02:13.290> renege

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
this is him versus renege

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
this is him versus renege
and<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.880> normal<00:02:15.300> renekton

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and that's not the normal renekton

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.930 
and that's not the normal renekton
that's<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> skins<00:02:16.980> which<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.550> guess

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
that's a one of the skins which I guess

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.020 
that's a one of the skins which I guess
I'll<00:02:18.120> pull<00:02:18.330> up<00:02:18.480> right<00:02:18.660> now<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.460> had<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:20.640> lost<00:02:20.850> a

actually<00:02:38.040> last<00:02:38.400> week<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.730> believe<00:02:39.410> okay<00:02:40.410> so

this is him standing in front of
renekton<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.160> would<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.370> be

around renekton this is his cue when he
smashes<00:02:52.170> someone<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.740> whenever<00:02:53.190> he<00:02:53.370> uses

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
smashes someone and whenever he uses

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.640 
smashes someone and whenever he uses
that<00:02:53.820> he<00:02:54.000> gains<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.480> stack<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.230> if<00:02:55.350> he<00:02:55.380> kills

that he gains a stack what if he kills

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.760 
that he gains a stack what if he kills
the<00:02:55.890> minion<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:58.080> too<00:02:58.350> sure<00:02:58.560> what

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
the minion with it I'm not too sure what

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.850 
the minion with it I'm not too sure what
that<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.880> his<00:03:00.090> back<00:03:00.540> his<00:03:01.200> recall<00:03:01.650> he

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that is is that his back his recall he

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.750 
that is is that his back his recall he
has<00:03:01.950> three<00:03:02.280> dog<00:03:02.520> heads<00:03:02.820> holy<00:03:03.660> crap<00:03:04.760> then

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
has three dog heads holy crap then

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.949 
has three dog heads holy crap then
there's<00:03:06.000> him<00:03:06.360> using<00:03:06.780> his<00:03:06.890> either<00:03:07.890> circle<00:03:08.959> him

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
there's him using his either circle him

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.680 
there's him using his either circle him
just<00:03:10.290> standing<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:11.030> him<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.209> his<00:03:12.360> normal

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
just standing there him in his normal

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.410 
just standing there him in his normal
stance<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:14.160> guess<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.910> recall

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
stance and I guess that's the recall
