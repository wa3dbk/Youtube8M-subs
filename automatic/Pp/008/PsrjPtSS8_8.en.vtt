00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.699
 I'm going to talk about a whole topic about a 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.130
 diet a specific diet that I finish 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.750
 to try to tell her then eating with her 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.550
 what I think about diet and so on 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.189
 etcetera let's start right away about 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
 the pineapple diet I started doing 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.560
 this diet then I told them on facebook 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.169
 that was going to be the diet to try it 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.010
 to see how it worked and then the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.339
 I started the diet and it lasted two days 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.589
 let's see the preparation of the 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:45.360
 land preparation 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:48.510
 ok this consists of a pineapple 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 a complete pineapple this pineapple is not very 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 big but it does not matter 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.240
 well then a pineapple and the whole shell 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.240
 we put the peel in a pot and 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.040
 this face we're going to boil 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 space of about 5 minutes or so 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.000
 something like that with a liter of carlos with a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000
 liter of water 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.040
 and with this we are going to make the juice that is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.570
 I'm going to apply all the pineapple and I'm going to 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 put here in this container that is going to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.890
 be my food today for tomorrow's 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.820
 breakfast and dinner ok let's see then 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.570
 how this project works 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.010
 ok girls lunch or lunch is supposed 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.830
 of this diet is a stew or soup 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.970
 I made my own this has 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 chicken cauliflower 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.899
 a couple of shrimp 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.280
 ok and that's why it looks like that 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.280
 I put color 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.190
 is to make me lunch 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.190
 O well 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.520
 and my girl is also eating 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.520
 there are people the food 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.319
 because I'm going to eat I'm very, very 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.850
 hungry and then dinner I do not think anymore 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.100
 you have to record it is not necessary 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.660
 it will be 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.520
 a rate of pineapple and well you saw 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.460
 I started to do my diet as he says 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.010
 because the diet consists of eating pineapple 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.390
 the morning more or less then a weight of 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.840
 pineapple basically at noon a soup or 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 broth that is made with vegetables and 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 with chicken then of course without pasta or 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.060
 nothing of that a cup that's why bread and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.190
 night again because pineapple because it's called 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.930
 the pineapple diet also consists of 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.480
 boil her carl the pineapple peel and 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.240
 Take that water for you can be with 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.290
 the hot or cold sweetener matters 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.140
 well all day long as well as you 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.940
 either he was losing 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.820
 weight up to that point pretty well and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.950
 I got crazy to try they gave to try 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.960
 to see why not analyze those are 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.210
 diets obviously quite enough 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.880
 unbalanced that is missing from many 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.440
 nutrients that's why they are made for example 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.819
 only for three days are diets 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.890
 emergency calls 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.019
 well there are people that works for them and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.060
 do a diet in this way then 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.280
 only for three days then it is not 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.230
 so serious is not it going to damage 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.209
 excessively your health, much less is 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.099
 that just does that for three days 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.109
 taking also is that when a 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.689
 person does not exist any longer because it is 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.239
 very harmful because it has a deficiency 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.010
 important industrial big well in my 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.230
 case that happened that sugar as a 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.359
 function or good then fatal 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.280
 it turns out that the mini bell for example 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.780
 the pressure of the sugar did not cost me 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.549
 he did nothing otherworldly with that 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.430
 it measured my pressure that admits me the sugar 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.600
 always in the morning and then I was not 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.850
 well that my sense did not affect me but 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.470
 my metabolism stopped completely 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 I stopped losing weight I stayed like 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.420
 shot and stops even though the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.240
 Food card shot them and no no no 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.330
 came down more or nothing at all because this 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.580
 back then 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.290
 I did the first day of the second day 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.880
 even half that simply and in the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.350
 night already helped with my pineapple I did it 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.239
 because it suits me insaladita and that and 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.350
 point the other day I asked my 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.350
 trainer in the gym 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.810
 and he told me I'm not going to explain why 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.560
 professional explanation 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.020
 the diets is of that type there are people 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.970
 that functional down well these 23 days 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.420
 not the problem there are people who do not 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.850
 What about this because the body is the 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.450
 human beings because they have a system of 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.510
 defenses and when you consume less 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.850
 amount of calories that's called 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.730
 also the basal weight 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.320
 for example when you have this, 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.180
 get the nasal weight as it is 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.870
 calculating the kilos that you have 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.270
 divided into 4 x 4 ok 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 how many kilos then 10 x 4 is the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.760
 number that gives you then nobody should of 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.410
 consume fewer calories than that number in 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.270
 my case this is better pretty much like 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.130
 of the hundred and something more or less peaks 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.170
 well and then I should not consume less 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.940
 900 calories in a thousand days because 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.260
 then because the body into 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.690
 alertness 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.800
 ok and what it does is that it stops to 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.630
 all its operation and you stop losing 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.770
 weight of course the body gets like 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960
 the reservation ok 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.620
 when that is consumed as a kind 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.850
 of survival because it does the 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.880
 body 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.420
 I'm getting enough energy in 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.770
 then under my performance 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.570
 so that then as now is not the 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.400
 reason why then how does it persist 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.380
 is not asking for weight, much less 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.300
 there are people who know that and 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.220
 it also worked and this good seven 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.830
 people but me in my personal case not 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.410
 I stop the system I lost control of 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.600
 system then I said I should not 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.370
 do immediately after 23 days I continued with 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.050
 my normal healthy eating and I know that my 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.030
 process of weight loss completely 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.760
 normal then nothing to end with 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.350
 the issue did not work 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.660
 therefore I will not recommend it 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.670
 obviously there are people obviously that 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.590
 they can do them and they can prove true 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.120
 that continue to have been working but they 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.340
 I remember at this time these are 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.140
 diets of only three days do not exceed 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.360
 this type of diets ever in life anymore 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.730
 three days because you can hit 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.960
 affect a lot very much to your health and 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.570
 in what the steak you scope me 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.040
 I recommend sanito in a healthy way 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.510
 the exercise loses equal weight 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.580
 then you do not have to kill yourself 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.470
 hungry or get to five hundred that 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.990
 up I was already pineapple and I wanted to go out 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.030
 running 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.200
 well nothing my loves but the contribution that 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.550
 I wanted several but that there 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.420
 liked the idea and this answer up 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.570
 the next 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.570
 bye
