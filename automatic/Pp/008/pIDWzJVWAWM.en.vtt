theater<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:24.600> said<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.080> pretty

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
theater it's actually said to be pretty

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
theater it's actually said to be pretty
similar<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> nuketown<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> pretty

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
similar to nuketown which is pretty

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
similar to nuketown which is pretty
awesome<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.350> compared<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
awesome and they actually compared it to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
awesome and they actually compared it to
newtown<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> trailer<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.270> nuketown<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
newtown in the trailer and nuketown is a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
newtown in the trailer and nuketown is a
map<00:01:31.320> i<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.280> i<00:01:32.460> don't<00:01:32.700> think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
map i really really like i don't think

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
map i really really like i don't think
it's<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> be<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.270> small<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.470> hopefully

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's going to be as small but hopefully

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
it's going to be as small but hopefully
it's<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.130> pretty<00:01:35.250> small<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.790> from

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's going to be pretty small and from

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's going to be pretty small and from
the<00:01:36.659> video<00:01:37.110> released<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.799> actually<00:01:38.040> has<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the video released it actually has a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
the video released it actually has a
bunch<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.579> different<00:01:38.850> colors<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.450> which<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
bunch of different colors to it which is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
bunch of different colors to it which is
something<00:01:40.200> i<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.159> maps<00:01:41.460> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
something i like as well for maps now

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.350 
something i like as well for maps now
after<00:01:42.659> driving<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:43.500> silo<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> silo

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
after driving there's also silo and silo

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.060 
after driving there's also silo and silo
is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> map<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> I'm<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
is a map that I'm not really going to be

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.639 
is a map that I'm not really going to be
the<00:01:47.189> biggest<00:01:47.369> fan<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.700> honestly<00:01:48.470> Treyarch<00:01:49.470> did

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the biggest fan of honestly Treyarch did

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.289 
the biggest fan of honestly Treyarch did
mention<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> biggest<00:01:50.640> maps<00:01:51.060> in

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mention it's one of the biggest maps in

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
mention it's one of the biggest maps in
the<00:01:51.360> game<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:52.829> large

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the game and there are some pretty large

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
the game and there are some pretty large
maps<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.750> large<00:01:55.049> maps

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
maps and I don't really like large maps

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
maps and I don't really like large maps
very<00:01:55.530> much<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.579> silo<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.600> based<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
very much but silo is actually based on

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
very much but silo is actually based on
a<00:01:57.990> Russian<00:01:58.770> nuclear<00:01:59.280> missile<00:01:59.729> silo

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
a Russian nuclear missile silo

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
a Russian nuclear missile silo
construction<00:02:00.750> site<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> looks<00:02:02.310> like

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
construction site you know it looks like

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
construction site you know it looks like
it's<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> decent<00:02:03.149> map<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it's going to be a decent map but the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.330 
it's going to be a decent map but the
size<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.649> something<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:04.950> probably<00:02:05.189> not

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
size it's something I'm probably not

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.800 
size it's something I'm probably not
going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> biggest<00:02:05.850> fan<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.180> I'm<00:02:06.719> sure

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
going to be the biggest fan of I'm sure

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
going to be the biggest fan of I'm sure
it'll<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.259> good<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.469> objective<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.489> types

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it'll be good for objective game types

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.260 
it'll be good for objective game types
like<00:02:08.970> demolition<00:02:09.720> domination<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
like demolition domination and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.890 
like demolition domination and
headquarters<00:02:12.270> oh

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
headquarters oh

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660 
headquarters oh
now<00:02:13.170> next<00:02:13.379> up<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.920> next<00:02:14.099> map<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.400> actually

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
now next up the next map is actually

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
now next up the next map is actually
called<00:02:14.849> hazard<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.659> it's<00:02:15.959> actually<00:02:16.049> pretty

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
called hazard and it's actually pretty

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.229 
called hazard and it's actually pretty
similar<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.129> world<00:02:17.459> at<00:02:17.610> war<00:02:17.640> map<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.180> you

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
similar to a world at war map for you

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.580 
similar to a world at war map for you
guys<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.420> used<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> play<00:02:18.810> world<00:02:19.110> at<00:02:19.230> war<00:02:19.379> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
guys that used to play world at war I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.979 
guys that used to play world at war I
wasn't<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> biggest<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:21.569> didn't

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
wasn't really the biggest I didn't

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.600 
wasn't really the biggest I didn't
really<00:02:22.200> play<00:02:22.319> world<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.680> war<00:02:22.860> too<00:02:23.010> much<00:02:23.189> wasn't

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
really play world of war too much wasn't

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.100 
really play world of war too much wasn't
my<00:02:23.700> favorite<00:02:23.879> call<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.269> duty<00:02:24.450> game<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.019> this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
my favorite call of duty game but this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.390 
my favorite call of duty game but this
privilege<00:02:25.439> pretty<00:02:25.769> similar<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.129> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
privilege pretty similar to the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
privilege pretty similar to the
cliffside<00:02:26.970> map<00:02:27.269> which<00:02:27.629> is<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.900> world<00:02:28.079> at<00:02:28.170> war<00:02:28.319> I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
cliffside map which is in world at war I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.559 
cliffside map which is in world at war I
personally<00:02:29.159> did<00:02:29.310> pretty<00:02:29.519> much<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.329> map

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
personally did pretty much like that map

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.479 
personally did pretty much like that map
for<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.870> most<00:02:31.019> part<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.439> for<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.129> one<00:02:32.310> it's

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
for the most part and for this one it's

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.789 
for the most part and for this one it's
actually<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.819> golf<00:02:33.180> course<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.689> around<00:02:34.049> which

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
actually a golf course all around which

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.770 
actually a golf course all around which
is<00:02:34.950> pretty<00:02:35.099> cool<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:36.030> trailer<00:02:36.299> dimension

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
is pretty cool and a trailer dimension

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.089 
is pretty cool and a trailer dimension
this<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.439> be<00:02:37.500> perfect<00:02:37.739> for

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
this one is going to be perfect for

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.190 
this one is going to be perfect for
snipers<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:38.760> assault<00:02:39.209> rifles<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.079> does

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
snipers and assault rifles so it does

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.300 
snipers and assault rifles so it does
not<00:02:40.349> look<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.590> there's<00:02:40.859> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> be<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.159> lot

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
not look like there's going to be a lot

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.429 
not look like there's going to be a lot
of<00:02:41.340> clothes<00:02:41.760> engagement<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> map<00:02:43.140> now

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
of clothes engagement in the map now

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.229 
of clothes engagement in the map now
guys<00:02:44.040> those<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.579> four<00:02:44.819> new<00:02:45.000> multiplayer

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
guys those are the four new multiplayer

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.240 
guys those are the four new multiplayer
maps<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.170> course<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.560> most<00:02:46.680> important

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
maps but of course the most important

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.670 
maps but of course the most important
new<00:02:47.370> map<00:02:47.549> from<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.909> DLC<00:02:48.359> as<00:02:48.540> always<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
new map from the DLC as always is the
