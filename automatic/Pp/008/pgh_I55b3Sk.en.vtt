00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.590
 hello that as I always hope you 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.880
 you find the best is today hilde 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.230
 in charge of removing your cough and in this 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.669
 occasion we are going to review a new 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.170
 choice is about the ballad of 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.489
 gunman or also known as 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.840
 mariachi song by antonio banderas 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.460
 as you saw the video at the beginning 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.690
 let's review the intro as always 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.430
 we go directly to the election very 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 well starting with the intro we have to 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.780
 make this down or as interesting 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.840
 first we have to do the following 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.430
 movement of four notes placing the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 middle finger on the second fret of the 5th 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 we are going to play this same string and 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.730
 then let's do a hammer on 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.860
 a hammer on or hammering is playing loud 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.360
 a string in order to be heard 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.000
 that same movement is to say that the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.310
 sound tread after we go to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.710
 make a pu lof that is to stretch the rope 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.090
 only with this finger in order to 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.979
 that a sound is produced that is to say 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.840
 I'm just going to stretch the rope towards 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.229
 down so I should listen to everything 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.229
 together 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.549
 and then I'm going to make another hammer on 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.619
 this time with the middle finger of the second 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.970
 fret of the fifth string so these 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.180
 four movements should be heard 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.530
 well once we have these four 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.310
 movements we are going to do the following 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.009
 five movements that are these 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 first of all let's touch the sixth 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.909
 string on the third fret and then the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.880
 fifth to the air and then we're going to do 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 the next thing we're going to play in the second 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 fret of the sixth string once 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.090
 we make a hammer on again and for 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.009
 last we are going to play the sixth string at 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.390
 air so this second part should 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.040
 listen yes 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.040
 all together should sound like this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.270
 for the next part to place a 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.270
 my minor and we are going to do the following 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.170
 it's about pretty movements 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.030
 simple first let's make a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.470
 small descending arpeggio from 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.980
 the sixth string to finish in the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.270
 fourth with the thumb and then 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's do the following with your finger 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.070
 index and a half in the third and second 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.270
 rope respectively it's about six 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.110
 movements we are going to do the first 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.060
 four between the third and second and 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.540
 then we are going to add the index finger 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 to the first fret of the second string 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.950
 let's make a move and again 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.989
 let's do the movement without stepping 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.170
 nothing so that every point should sound 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.170
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.390
 the next movement is quite 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.390
 interesting and it sounds pretty nice 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.800
 following in the minor we will make a 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.310
 small strumming from the fourth 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.870
 rope to finish in the first and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.110
 then we will play second and third 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.060
 and then fourth and third and finally 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 let's change our hand by placing 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.840
 in the following way this figure that is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.150
 the index finger from a fret of the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.530
 third rope and the ring finger in the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.810
 fourth of the fourth 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.620
 and then we finished with this sequence and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 that should sound like this 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.120
 to me 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.510
 So far what we have should 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.510
 sound like this 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.540
 continuing the figure that we 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.130
 we are in the first part of the intro 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.130
 let's make the next move 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.360
 first of all let's move the finger 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.840
 index to the second fret of the fifth 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.090
 string and we're going to play fifth and fourth 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.980
 then we will return the index finger 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.870
 where was the safe latex fret 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.939
 remember and we are going to give four touches 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.040
 placing the index finger in the fourth 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.040
 rope and the middle finger in the third 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.340
 then we are going to remove the index finger and 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.140
 let's play third and second on air 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.200
 and repositioning the index finger 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.120
 let's play fourth and third 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.120
 so every board should sound like this 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.380
 and the last part that is the one with which 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.380
 closes the intro sounds like this 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.610
 although it seems a bit complicated in 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.990
 reality is quite simple first that 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.210
 nothing we are going to place the index in the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.890
 first fret of the second and the middle 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.330
 on the second fret of the third 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.540
 we assure first the following 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.540
 movement 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.409
 first we're going to make it third 

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:48.409
 second second at this speed 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.650
 then we are going to remove our hand and 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.249
 let's do according to the third second 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.249
 specifically at this speed 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.540
 and finally we are going to play the second 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.370
 fret of the third string 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.370
 so every point should sound like this 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.060
 once here we are going to do the last 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.060
 part 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.330
 let's add the ring finger by the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.919
 that reaches us in the fourth fret of 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.880
 the fourth string first of all let's go 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.970
 to do that 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.890
 it is the fourth the second and 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.630
 then the second one to the air later we go 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.330
 to do second in the fourth quarter of 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.210
 the fourth third air and a radio 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.200
 final in my minor so the latter 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.200
 part should sound like this 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.490
 and ready can now play the intro without 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.490
 no problem
