in<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.330> part<00:00:03.600> we'll<00:00:03.810> add<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.200> mask<00:00:04.410> modifier

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:04.979 
in this part we'll add the mask modifier

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.910 
in this part we'll add the mask modifier
to<00:00:05.189> hide<00:00:05.370> geometry<00:00:05.939> under<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.330> clothing<00:00:06.920> the

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
to hide geometry under the clothing the

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.280 
to hide geometry under the clothing the
mask<00:00:08.220> modifier<00:00:08.790> enables<00:00:09.360> us<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> reduce<00:00:09.960> poly

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
mask modifier enables us to reduce poly

and<00:00:28.530> a<00:00:29.220> sign<00:00:31.250> next<00:00:32.250> we'll<00:00:32.700> add<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.910> mask

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
and a sign next we'll add a mask
