it<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.110> don't<00:02:05.290> need<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.560> turn<00:02:05.740> your<00:02:05.920> body<00:02:06.070> too

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
it you don't need to turn your body too

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.020 
it you don't need to turn your body too
much<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:07.180> I'm<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.689> turning<00:02:08.229> all<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.739> way<00:02:09.030> 180

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
much so I'm not turning all the way 180

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420 
much so I'm not turning all the way 180
anymore<00:02:10.450> although<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:10.959> possible<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:12.130> much

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
anymore although it's possible it's much

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.009 
anymore although it's possible it's much
more<00:02:12.640> relaxed<00:02:13.000> than<00:02:13.299> that<00:02:13.510> you're<00:02:13.780> turning

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
more relaxed than that you're turning

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.699 
more relaxed than that you're turning
just<00:02:14.530> enough<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.820> you're<00:02:15.940> swaying<00:02:16.239> your<00:02:16.450> body

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
just enough so you're swaying your body

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.500 
just enough so you're swaying your body
but<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.010> know<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.250> more<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.489> 45<00:02:19.030> degrees

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
but you know it's more like 45 degrees

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.720 
but you know it's more like 45 degrees
to<00:02:19.660> each<00:02:19.780> side<00:02:20.079> and<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:21.549> should<00:02:21.700> be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
to each side and that that should be

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.240 
to each side and that that should be
plenty

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.490 

so<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.970> course<00:02:28.210> what<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.870> want<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.380> now
