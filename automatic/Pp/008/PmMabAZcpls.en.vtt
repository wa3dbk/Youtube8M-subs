today I'm reviewing the combo between
breeze<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.040> ogrum<00:00:08.460> now<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> only

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
breeze and ogrum now this is the only

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.270

combo i'll be reviewing because this is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.600 
combo i'll be reviewing because this is
my<00:00:11.400> favorite<00:00:11.790> out<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.210> them<00:00:12.360> and

my favorite out of all of them and
overall<00:00:14.610> i<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.750> opinion

overall i think this is in my opinion

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
overall i think this is in my opinion
the<00:00:16.350> best<00:00:16.680> combo<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> shows<00:00:18.090> more<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the best combo because it shows more of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.410 
the best combo because it shows more of
the<00:00:18.570> hero<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> villain<00:00:19.080> aside<00:00:19.740> play<00:00:20.010> um<00:00:20.670> i'm

a ton of spare parts shows me how much
lego<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.640> much<00:00:26.789> effort<00:00:26.910> lego<00:00:27.359> put<00:00:27.630> into

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
lego on how much effort lego put into

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
lego on how much effort lego put into
this<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.529> sort<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.010> did<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.429> this

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this they actually sort of did on this

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
this they actually sort of did on this
combo<00:00:30.179> model<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.660> there's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.019> lot<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> spare

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
combo model but there's a lot of spare

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.869 
combo model but there's a lot of spare
parts<00:00:32.030> so<00:00:33.620> here<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:36.020> these<00:00:37.020> grown<00:00:37.440> or

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
parts so here we have these grown or

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
parts so here we have these grown or
abras<00:00:38.879> i<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.570> whatever<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
abras i don't know whatever you want to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
abras i don't know whatever you want to
call<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:40.980> him<00:00:41.910> her<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.280> used<00:00:45.379> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
call it him her so i think they used a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.540 
call it him her so i think they used a
very<00:00:46.980> good<00:00:47.190> amount<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> pieces<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> show

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
very good amount of pieces the show

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
very good amount of pieces the show
autumn's<00:00:50.550> vilnius<00:00:51.030> sign<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.539> raises<00:00:51.899> hero

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
autumn's vilnius sign and raises hero

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.740 
autumn's vilnius sign and raises hero
side<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.420> use<00:00:54.570> some

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
side the back I think could use some

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.770 
side the back I think could use some
work<00:00:54.780> maybe<00:00:55.410> flipped<00:00:55.739> around<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.629> this<00:00:57.629> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
work maybe flipped around if this is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
work maybe flipped around if this is
actually<00:00:57.899> built<00:00:58.230> very<00:00:58.530> nice<00:00:58.829> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> see

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
actually built very nice if you can see

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.660 
actually built very nice if you can see
in<00:00:59.609> there<00:01:00.770> what<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.190> any<00:01:02.309> other<00:01:02.489> way

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
in there what about to any other way

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250 
in there what about to any other way
myself<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.359> except<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:03.960> maybe<00:01:04.080> these

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
myself I think except for maybe these

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.510 
myself I think except for maybe these
arms<00:01:05.659> um<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
arms um I think this is over all just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.149 
arms um I think this is over all just
sort<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.170> combo<00:01:10.830> because

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
sort of like a really good combo because

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.200 
sort of like a really good combo because
it<00:01:11.549> fits<00:01:11.790> pretty<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:13.100> if<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.490> were<00:01:14.670> Lego<00:01:14.970> if

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it fits pretty well if I were Lego if

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
it fits pretty well if I were Lego if
maybe<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.689> touched<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.259> few<00:01:16.439> things<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
maybe I touched up a few things like the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.990 
maybe I touched up a few things like the
arms<00:01:17.369> amount<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.880> spikes<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.720> few<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:20.000> vines

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
arms amount of spikes a few more vines

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.539 
arms amount of spikes a few more vines
around<00:01:21.270> him<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:21.960> her<00:01:22.110> i<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.220> make

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
around him or her i would actually make

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.350 
around him or her i would actually make
this<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> set<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.650> 14<00:01:26.520> 99<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
this a set and for like 14 99 one of the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
this a set and for like 14 99 one of the
larger<00:01:27.720> ones<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.320> 1299<00:01:28.829> whatever<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> prices

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
larger ones for 1299 whatever the prices

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.069 
larger ones for 1299 whatever the prices
are<00:01:29.850> where<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.090> live<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:32.090> yeah<00:01:33.090> has<00:01:33.630> these

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
are where we live so yeah has these

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.800 
are where we live so yeah has these
blades<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.040> came<00:01:35.280> from

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
blades that came from

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.100 
blades that came from
breezes<00:01:36.680> stabbing<00:01:37.610> claw<00:01:40.030> just<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.149> lot<00:01:41.329> of<00:01:41.360> good

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
breezes stabbing claw just a lot of good

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.170 
breezes stabbing claw just a lot of good
contrast<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:44.479> legs<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.079> wish<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:45.920> had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
contrast the legs I wish they had

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.789 
contrast the legs I wish they had
included<00:01:47.180> maybe<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.810> fair<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.500> there

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
included maybe this fair and that there

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.039 
included maybe this fair and that there
so<00:01:49.399> they<00:01:49.520> weren't<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:49.850> like<00:01:50.030> plasma<00:01:50.390> clear

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
so they weren't so like plasma clear

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.980 
so they weren't so like plasma clear
clear<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:53.979> so<00:01:54.979> overall<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.640> think<00:01:56.149> this<00:01:56.539> is<00:01:56.600> a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
clear like so overall I think this is a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.480 
clear like so overall I think this is a
great<00:01:57.890> combo<00:01:58.880> model<00:01:59.479> I<00:02:00.130> recommend<00:02:01.130> if<00:02:01.369> you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
great combo model I recommend if you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.289 
great combo model I recommend if you
