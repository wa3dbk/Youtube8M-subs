careful and make sure that when we're
distributing<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:55.570> through<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.930> hair<00:01:56.110> it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
distributing it through the hair it

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.980 
distributing it through the hair it
works<00:01:56.950> through<00:01:57.399> more<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.180> than<00:01:58.210> mid<00:01:58.539> links<00:01:58.869> in

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
works through more so than mid links in

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.289 
works through more so than mid links in
the<00:01:59.110> ends<00:01:59.409> rather<00:01:59.920> than<00:02:00.190> up<00:02:00.430> in<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> roots<00:02:00.939> it

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
the ends rather than up in the roots it

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.420 
the ends rather than up in the roots it
can<00:02:01.630> weigh<00:02:01.869> her<00:02:02.110> down<00:02:02.140> if<00:02:02.530> we<00:02:02.649> put<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.070> heavier

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
can weigh her down if we put to heavier

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.679 
can weigh her down if we put to heavier
bar<00:02:04.090> more<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:05.189> pick<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.220> cream<00:02:06.909> into<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.509> hair

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
bar more to pick a cream into the hair

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.870 
bar more to pick a cream into the hair
so<00:02:08.530> we<00:02:08.649> can<00:02:08.800> work<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.039> through<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.610> begin

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
so we can work this through to begin

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.780 
so we can work this through to begin
with<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.019> fingers<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.310> way<00:02:15.459> down

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
with with the fingers all the way down

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.030 
with with the fingers all the way down
into<00:02:15.970> those<00:02:16.209> ends<00:02:16.569> obviously<00:02:17.080> that's<00:02:17.739> where

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
into those ends obviously that's where

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.620 
into those ends obviously that's where
the<00:02:18.160> hair<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.370> driest<00:02:19.030> right<00:02:19.269> through<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the hair is driest right through the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.449 
the hair is driest right through the
ends<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.019> hair<00:02:20.110> cut<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.959> then<00:02:22.959> from<00:02:23.380> there

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
ends of the hair cut and then from there

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.460 
ends of the hair cut and then from there
to<00:02:24.459> distribute<00:02:24.970> evenly<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:25.569> comb<00:02:26.019> through

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
to distribute evenly we comb through

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.640 
to distribute evenly we comb through
again<00:02:26.799> making<00:02:27.610> sure<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> products<00:02:28.650> are

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
again making sure that the products are

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.780 
again making sure that the products are
distributed<00:02:29.860> evenly<00:02:30.819> throughout<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:31.980> hair

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 

so<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.689> we<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.959> suitable<00:02:37.349> styling

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so now that we have a suitable styling

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.709 
so now that we have a suitable styling
product<00:02:38.219> apply<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.150> need<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> look

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
product apply we now need to look

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.630 
product apply we now need to look
through<00:02:39.959> our<00:02:39.989> blow-dry<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.859> our<00:02:41.099> finish<00:02:41.489> that

through our blow-dry and our finish that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.890 
through our blow-dry and our finish that
we're<00:02:41.790> going<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.060> achieve<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.670> beginning

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
we're going to achieve so beginning

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.209 
we're going to achieve so beginning
depending<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.170> haircut<00:02:46.439> and<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> type<00:02:47.189> of

depending on the haircut and the type of

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.580 
depending on the haircut and the type of
the<00:02:47.459> shape<00:02:47.700> i<00:02:47.909> would<00:02:48.390> start<00:02:48.659> through<00:02:49.079> here<00:02:49.319> in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the shape i would start through here in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.470 
the shape i would start through here in
the<00:02:50.010> nape<00:02:50.219> area<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.819> i<00:02:50.879> will<00:02:51.030> work<00:02:51.239> up

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the nape area and i will work up

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.589 
the nape area and i will work up
horizontally<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:52.769> my<00:02:52.950> sections<00:02:53.459> working<00:02:54.420> on

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
horizontally with my sections working on

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.509 
horizontally with my sections working on
blow<00:02:54.840> drying<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.379> smoothing<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.950> hair<00:02:56.159> as<00:02:56.370> i

blow drying and smoothing the hair as i
go<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.700> begin<00:03:00.000> by<00:03:00.150> taking<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.569> horizontal

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
go so begin by taking a horizontal

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.849 
go so begin by taking a horizontal
section<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.430> nape<00:03:02.670> area<00:03:06.469> you<00:03:07.469> can<00:03:07.650> clip

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
section in the nape area you can clip

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.190 
section in the nape area you can clip
this<00:03:08.010> hair<00:03:08.250> forward<00:03:08.689> sometimes<00:03:09.689> these<00:03:09.870> clips

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
this hair forward sometimes these clips

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.319 
this hair forward sometimes these clips
are<00:03:10.379> good<00:03:10.530> sometimes<00:03:11.129> people<00:03:11.670> prefer<00:03:11.970> bigger

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
are good sometimes people prefer bigger

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.270 
are good sometimes people prefer bigger
buffalo<00:03:13.230> clips<00:03:13.530> particularly<00:03:14.069> if<00:03:14.159> you're

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
buffalo clips particularly if you're

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.159 
buffalo clips particularly if you're
working<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.879> yourself<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.750> sometimes

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
working on it yourself it sometimes

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.629 
working on it yourself it sometimes
makes<00:03:16.379> it<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.590> little<00:03:16.709> bit<00:03:16.889> easier<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.310> manage

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
makes it a little bit easier to manage

so working working with my blow dryer

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.949 
so working working with my blow dryer
and<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.459> nice<00:03:20.669> hot<00:03:20.970> heat<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.389> now<00:03:21.629> going<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
begin to smooth from the roots down

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.569 
begin to smooth from the roots down
through<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.319> ends<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.709> hair<00:03:25.799> making

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
through to the ends of the hair making

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.000 
through to the ends of the hair making
sure<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.180> we're<00:03:27.359> sealing<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.560> top<00:03:28.769> surface

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
sure that we're sealing the top surface

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.849

finish from here I will keep working
parallel<00:05:02.319> sections<00:05:03.090> fairly<00:05:04.090> large<00:05:04.560> up<00:05:05.560> and

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
parallel sections fairly large up and

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.649 
parallel sections fairly large up and
around<00:05:06.219> following<00:05:06.759> the<00:05:06.879> round<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.509> head

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
around following the round of the head

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.860 
around following the round of the head
and<00:05:07.810> working<00:05:08.199> up<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.530> your<00:05:08.650> natural<00:05:08.830> parting

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
and working up to your natural parting

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.290 
and working up to your natural parting
obviously<00:05:10.870> paying<00:05:11.169> attention<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:13.000> shape

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
obviously paying attention to the shape

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.809 
obviously paying attention to the shape
in<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.599> face<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.710> obviously<00:05:15.250> any<00:05:15.520> height

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
in the face and obviously any height

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.490 
in the face and obviously any height
that<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.090> want<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.389> create<00:05:16.659> on<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:16.960> crown<00:05:17.319> at

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
that you want to create on the crown at

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.159 
that you want to create on the crown at
this<00:05:17.650> point<00:05:17.949> as<00:05:18.099> you<00:05:18.550> blow<00:05:18.789> dry<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:20.020> keep

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
this point as you blow dry just keep

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.290 
this point as you blow dry just keep
working<00:05:20.590> parallel<00:05:21.039> sections<00:05:21.550> all<00:05:21.969> the<00:05:22.210> way

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
working parallel sections all the way

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.279 
working parallel sections all the way
through<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.870> let<00:05:23.409> that<00:05:23.560> hair<00:05:23.830> full<00:05:24.069> smoothly

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
through and let that hair full smoothly

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.450 
through and let that hair full smoothly
okay<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:26.500> that's<00:05:26.680> how<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:26.889> would<00:05:27.219> deal<00:05:27.430> with

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
okay so that's how I would deal with

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.539 
okay so that's how I would deal with
puffy<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> have
