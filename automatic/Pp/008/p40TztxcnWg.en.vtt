00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.190
 configure our computer to 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.690
 increase the wifi signal that we receive 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.189
 for this we can do it or we can 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.160
 get through the following route 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.750
 down here where our access appears 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.970
 to the internet we can hit the right button 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.039
 open the center of networks and resources 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.720
 shared and we come to this window 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.670
 this window if you notice is in the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.010
 control panel internet networks center 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.340
 of networks that is we can also get 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.270
 in windows 8.1 through another route 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.270
 and it's on the right side 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.860
 well we can look for the control panel 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.399
 or shared resources center or networks 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.900
 or we can go to panel configuration 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.630
 control 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.020
 the control panel internet networks and 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.560
 then central networks and you see we got to 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.809
 the very same window as to which 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.760
 we came through here vale is 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.720
 exactly the same here we are going to 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.640
 change adapter settings 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.220
 when our wifi appears here 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.900
 right button we give properties and if 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.500
 asks for the administrator's password 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.820
 we put it once we're here 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.010
 we are going to configure 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.000
 and in configure we go to options 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.130
 advanced 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.140
 these are the data that come to us 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.730
 defect in this card 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.370
 fix 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:42.570
 here 256 60 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.340
 while smith buffer 512 with these 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.750
 values let's now do a test 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.570
 of how the internet goes about what is the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.550
 speed we're going to test it we're going to 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.460
 change the values and then we're going to 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 retest to see the increase 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.000
 Of the signal 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.000
 we go to google 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.290
 and here we put speed 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.290
 adsl 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.250
 test 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.840
 there are many pages where you can do 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 tests I'm going to take this for example 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.069
 from movistar because it is the network that 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.069
 I have contracted 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.620
 I think the movistar page 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.069
 and if you look here there is a section that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.069
 start the test puts you click 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.140
 if you see this window this appears 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.140
 the first time you open 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.550
 I click here so I do not get back 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.790
 to appear this is javascript 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.790
 it's nothing we're going to execute and allow 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:56.110
 and starts to test the speed that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.110
 we now 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.250
 It will be both download and upload 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.980
 we show here the data we have 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.560
 and then here we can give a repeat test 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.170
 when we call him, we have 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.030
 we had changed the configuration let's 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.390
 to close this window you can close 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.390
 Internet 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.110
 I go back to the window where we were 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.120
 let's go to properties 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.120
 let's go to the card set 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.410
 advanced options and we're going to change 13 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.410
 pit bull fer we are going to put 512 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.620
 the interval we are going to put 120 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 and it's another value we let you know in 512 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.010
 let's accept 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.930
 check now it's not connected 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.990
 and then reconnects with those 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.290
 values ​​that we have put now 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.920
 then what we do is that 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.920
 we open again internet 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.200
 Well, it's the same 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.360
 let's go to the movistar page 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.770
 you can use any other page 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.770
 let's start test 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.200
 and we see the data and we can compare them 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.010
 with what we had obtained 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.010
 previously 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.200
 well also tell you that depending on 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:30.350
 the time of your connection and the zone 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.420
 where you are internet can vary in your 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.030
 good speed I hope you have 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.640
