00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.750
 and in the end he all race days there are always technical cues in 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.400
 that can be useful the important to know them can also see it from outside 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.099
 it is not easy to understand everything but in principle I believe I have 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.959
 understood that who 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.810
 in bed well this type of backdrop for another rather poor from what 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 I understand he managed to set the race somehow and eventually got it 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.419
 some fish fruity 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.569
 others were stubborn about dog beliefs that had to be forced 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.199
 presenting the fish made me travel so much without losing time 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.200
 pescara 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
 I especially noticed that 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.230
 some after 15 20 minutes had understood that they had to stay in the water 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.560
 scratching to be able to take something other instead for the whole race are 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.400
 went ahead I believe in these situations you went ahead and 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.860
 back without having certainties he lost a lot of time what he was 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.750
 necessary for not ending up anyway anyway girls 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.950
 deconcentrate that moved 3 4 5 times not to catch a fish as opposed to 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.440
 scratching tunes to catch one two fish then we are clearly exalted 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.960
 they realized that this was a winning tactic they continued for the whole 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.070
 race fact is that among the first there are people who are never monsters 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.880
 among the last few tv there are several people that turn the tracks instead 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.750
 very much this is a fact, in short, I think this is a bit 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 read the certainty I don't have, but how many surnames and nutrition 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.760
 antifanzine tomorrow with current photos vea q I had already said that yesterday this 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.270
 competition field that already had 30 years ago was an unknown factor could leave 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.980
 always space surprises 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.410
 believe even for tomorrow there will surely be surprises and despite it will be 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.380
 more fishy than today I hypothesize 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.580
 and in any case it is reading 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.670
 T-shirts and found the ability to guess where the fish can stand 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 where it does not record absolutely will make the big difference 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.520
 Please pray
