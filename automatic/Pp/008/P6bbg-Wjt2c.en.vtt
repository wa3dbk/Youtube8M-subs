00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 they did it that's what not worth 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
 today yesterday marc keller they have it 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 did the racing did it ch yes the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.429
 players actually and the staff did it 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.290
 it's true that it was a very busy season 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 complicated and it's true that ultimately 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 we manage to climb by being first to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 the goal difference the last day 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.900
 so it was played out in detail 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.000
 but I think the team never 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.949
 loose 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 the players put last seven 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.519
 outstanding matches because we have 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 won six times and we made a draw 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 and so I believe that the victory is and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.930
 the ascent is deserved how is going 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.770
 half time to half time 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 you lead you will see the players 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 I go punctually in 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 halfway lockers there I'm there 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.550
 went over to be quiet because 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.670
 I get a little teased by them 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
 dragon supporters at epinal h and the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.770
 are an arrival this third but 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 I do not intervene there his brothers françois 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.120
 the coach who manages the troops and he 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.980
 what did they say at that time? 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.210
 especially a lot of calm for three 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.379
 four minutes of calm in the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 cloakroom so that players can 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.199
 recover and after they try to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.030
 to distil some offensive solutions 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 or defensive to fix problems 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 that we had to settle and after 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.760
 players are coming out again well 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.060
 motivated and well rested it plays well to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.799
 five minutes from the end they lead 3-0 on 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.210
 see these good greenhouse we won the match 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.770
 we are ready to blow champagne 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.900
 you too I imagine 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.909
 ben me I was in the stands next door 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 philippe richert t2 of roland ries 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.890
 was actually at 3-0 we thought that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 the match was over quickly and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 mark that first goal rahan then the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.869
 penalty and you're right he stayed 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 two three minutes of play and there 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.049
 actually there was a wind of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 panic I believe in all the public 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 Alsatian but fortunately the referee has 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.110
 hissed the end of the match and the rise 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 was at the end of this match where we saw a 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 coach of raon the stage who were moaning 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 about racing what are you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.570
 have to answer frankly I do not know 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.259
 more what to answer 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.090
 I think the match organized then 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 if we go back to what happened on 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.450
 match had to be organized at the stage 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.710
 there are meetings that have been 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 organized at a fortnight 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.970
 unfortunately that day the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 dragon leaders did not wish 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.170
 on a platform to welcome 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.120
 3000 Alsatian and the sub-prefecture 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.370
 after a good decision with the police 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.580
 it is to say we can not open 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 only ATMs for 400 or 500 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 Alsatian there would be a problem of 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.530
 public safety and the match was 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.500
 relocated we do not know strictly 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.910
 say nothing in this decision 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.190
 actually relocation has been 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.340
 decided to epinal and unfortunately in 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 this second meeting concerning epinal 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.610
 the ramon coach you're talking about 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.310
 who attend this meeting while 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.040
 it's not his specialty to block a 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 little our supporters says that the ability 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.470
 of 7000 people of epinal must be 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.080
 reduced to 2500 which limited the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.120
 designers at 700 so obviously that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.350
 it was a 4 a solution 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 catastrophic in terms of safety 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.620
 public and fortunately a one of 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.790
 dsp so the aid director beyond the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.959
 police of the vosges who took this 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.870
 decision with the prefecture 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.420
 so I regret that the coach of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.570
 rahan does not accept the sports sentence 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.280
 we have been ultra correct all year long 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.820
 in this decision a strictly 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.829
 nothing to see 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.390
 whether it's my brother the coach and 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.549
 all the players they showed 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.440
 humility of humility all season and 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.180
 I believe that contrary person 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.230
 favored the rise of racing all 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.299
 the teams that played against the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.340
 racing was motivated to 200% 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.410
 francois keller your brother did a 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.760
 outstanding work this season is this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.000
 that it's hard to work 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 brother 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.630
 frankly it's not difficult 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.560
 after that it's my brother I knew 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.130
 very well my brother but as 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.450
 coach I know that a lot of his 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.519
 teachers I think of jacky duguépéroux 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.739
 to dropping larguet to freddy six months on 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.850
 said the greatest good and I believe 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.640
 that this year as last year 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.530
 he has he knew how to give a breath and a 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.540
 mindset to this group that allowed 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.160
 to the group to ride so he's really 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.600
 at the origin of this rise with the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.730
 players and all his staff 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.050
 I said it when I arrived at 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.310
 usual fashion last year that we them 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.050
 leaders and especially me in my 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.940
 president function I was there for 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.320
 tidying up behind the scenes 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.660
 because racing needs calm 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.910
 but that the truth that the heart of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.590
 reactor our club is the terrain and 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.140
 I think this year we have demonstrated 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.520
 that what interests the Alsatian public 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.300
 if the coach the players and not the 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.130
 everything that goes on behind the scenes 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.080
 and I think we did well 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.370
 side there also two questions the goals 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.880
 are marked by young people from the center of 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.450
 training 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.030
 what a joy to say that 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.120
 three scorers are three Alsatians 1-2 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.960
 low rhinois high rhinois 1 and 3 players 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.630
 trained at the club 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.820
 and again I mean when 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.500
 when I see the critics we have 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.210
 a little suffered attacks since this 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.030
 racing fell back into the amateur world 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.230
 on the pseudo training centers then 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.820
 that it's a training center that 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.680
 still exists that is not any more but 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.370
 that exist and that provides all 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.260
 Alsatian clubs 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.730
 I believe that racing success is not 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.020
 not only the success of strasbourg 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.690
 or the racing club of strasbourg alsace 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.890
 it is also a bowl of oxygen and air 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.110
 for all Alsatian clubs 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.940
 because of course that if the racing 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.350
 gets to go up everyone goes in 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.880
 enjoy but it's also the next generation 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.560
 finally the club obviously here 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.760
 wanted to train wanted to keep after you 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.600
 can see them from this business 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.550
 This is another thing 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.100
 last point is on the 1st dates 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.590
 June 79 their seat of champions of 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.690
 France June 1st, 2013 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.110
 funny concordance of dates for 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.430
 go up in national listen I am very 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.140
 I am I did not know and yet I 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.640
 am very superstitious and it's stone 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.500
 koenig and rené maechler who called me 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.660
 before the match his former leaders of 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.640
 of the nineteen seventies and who 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.230
 begging brand is in the lead and say it to 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.670
 the whole group that is thirty years old 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.970
 for day racing was champion of 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.070
 la France 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.350
 and indeed I find that this 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.300
 recovery is very symbolic that she 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.670
 happens the same day of course not the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.230
 same year 1 34 years later and I believe 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.980
 that it will be really a memory 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.980
 for all Alsatians
