00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.279
 boxing what to do I have prepared to die 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 it is not far from the thigh or 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.060
 something like that if it's not from this game that I'm going 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.680
 to go up to what you see many people 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 is not the next fifth incarnated not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 tranquility everyone had in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 mind this game from the beginning and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.440
 this good game that just came out is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 well it has come out in fact I think it comes out a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.829
 role of this I do not know what dates electrons 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.719
 the 13 together with taita pnv or the water if 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.399
 pressure a number I do not remember 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.379
 but well I have it here at home 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 that I'm going to put to record it butt and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 well what is this game guys this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.890
 it's a dark souls is from the creators of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.360
 from franchise software 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.329
 demon's souls one of the franchises 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320
 souls so to speak already dried up 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.210
 with a few million 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 demon's souls that was exclusive to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 playstation 3 then pulled out 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.579
 cross - platform of the dark souls and now 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.199
 is the second part that is repsol 2 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.550
 there is personally I like more the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.150
 demon's souls 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.680
 I spent both of them and now, well, now 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.660
 he has left this dark souls all give him 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 an opportunity an opportunity that 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.610
 he deserves because this game is like 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 I say it's a magna work so we're going to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 give you as I say a good opportunity 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 let's move on I hope you give us 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.470
 good good hours 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.910
 I think it deserves cushioning the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 channel I want to go up as I say more 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.970
 variety remember we are about 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.940
 to finish who don hard we are already in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.040
 the end of the world in fact already tomorrow not 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.210
 I passed the game but God 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.160
 I want you to watch tomorrow's episode 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.300

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.800

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.120

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.190
 same incidentally the episode and forlán 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.960
 day that lasts good does not really last 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.030
 one of the fourth because the sony vegas has 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.830
 tutored I do not know why it was done 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.330
 an hour and a quarter because he has retained a 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.100
 hour and a quarter actually won the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.350
 video lasts about 30 minutes with which 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.540
 well I'm with two friends of meat and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.250
 bone because they are not from u2 nothing but in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.300
 I know them from the street such are two 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 colleagues that joana minecraft 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.590
 usually so it was more than us 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.270
 we laugh, it's still there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.460
 episode forlan and killing the arcane 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 guardian one of the last voices that 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.030
 I'm going to go up in the series I suppose the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.130
 next episode 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.620
 it will be the last one as I tell you we are going to 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.569
 start to open towards the new season 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.190
 of the channel we remember what these state 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.110
 last two months with pokemon and no flow 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.330
 with whom don heart and with forlan day 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 exclusive sale and butt to stop because those 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.950
 two series pokemon daily 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.630
 obviously and forlán day and who leave 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.340
 then interspersing another day one day 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.400
 one day one day one other and continuously 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.890
 so nothing as I say the following 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.450
 Daily game is going to be one of pokemon 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.890
 obviously although I do not know exactly which 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.440
 put then you can not put that under 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.480
 the comments that pokemon played 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 you want me to climb I thought because 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.600
 monologizing in what the truth is that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.180
 It looks very good and I would like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.370
 upload some kind of random lock but now 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 we'll see with klose or something like that 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.970
 style that could as I have the wii and the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.620
 can emulate good web can emulate 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.390
 I can buy the pokemon with what they are and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.519
 pass it to me then it can also be the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.709
 interesting part too many people 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.800
 asked pixel mont I'll go up mons 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.720
 would be cooperative with who will be not 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.950
 I know I'll say it but it's going to be inside 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.690
 little bit too, just when it's over 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.269
 forlán of when I finish that I will not go up 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.780
 I will upload pixel mont 3.0 which is a 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.550
 update that a 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.970
 update of the mod pixel mont 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.500
 quite pretty uach and so too 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.310
 you can see it now is that I have 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.069
 eager to start the new 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.600
 Pokemon channel season and it's 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.860
 point of finishing is there on the verge of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.140
 candy a lot of people are doing for 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.209
 you 're just going to pass it on my own 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.340
 head says no you will not spend the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.540
 own hacks own hacks knows that I 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.610
 I'm going to pass it to you if you hacks but I'm going to 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.580

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.890
 I shit on the queue when this answers 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.390
 when jairo answers bad bad bad like that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.440
 that nothing like I say here is the one 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.959
 box and we're going to open it because I do not 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.160

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.420
 I tell you what is this world of dark 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.390
 souls not to assemble that are two then it is 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.070
 a pretty difficult game and that's why I 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.069
 upload as many people like me 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.260
 called the king of the files in the god of 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.930
 the files calls me a lot of people fail to 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.340
 word and this game is to not do fails 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.959
 Well fame is going up basically 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.610
 why good for so that people 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.350
 think that I do not if the king of the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.600
 Feil has happened to me the Demon's Souls me 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.919
 I have passed the dark souls 1 and it is good 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.440
 true that dead like everyone that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.330
 this game has been passed but but it has not 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.570
 dead and I'm not so bad so 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.820
 I want to vindicate myself 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.380
 and well we'll see to see if I 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.840
 I claim or not but I would like 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.650
 have a good time well this taxi 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.110
 it's a good role play 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.300
 and very much like the legend of zelda 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.490
 in quotes because you go only with your 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.500
 sword that feeling of loneliness sometimes 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.000
 of fear you will even make this game 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.410
 It can be very interesting as I say 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.180
 this is the only game I'm going to 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.060
