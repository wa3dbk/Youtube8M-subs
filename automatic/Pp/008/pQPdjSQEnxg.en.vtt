you by exam few calm no more fear from
exam<00:00:09.590> let<00:00:10.590> us<00:00:10.800> now<00:00:10.980> talk<00:00:11.040> about<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.730> cropping

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
exam let us now talk about the cropping

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780 
exam let us now talk about the cropping
patterns<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.710> first<00:00:13.980> thing<00:00:14.219> which<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.580> did

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
patterns so the first thing which we did

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
patterns so the first thing which we did
for<00:00:15.059> crop<00:00:15.690> production<00:00:15.890> improvement<00:00:16.890> was

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
for crop production improvement was

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.880 
for crop production improvement was
application<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.930> nutrients<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.619> is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
application of nutrients that is

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.500 
application of nutrients that is
nutrient<00:00:20.369> management<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> form<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
nutrient management in the form of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
nutrient management in the form of
manual<00:00:21.750> fertilizers<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.220> next<00:00:23.580> thing<00:00:23.760> which

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
manual fertilizers the next thing which

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
manual fertilizers the next thing which
we<00:00:23.910> did<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.359> irrigation<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> third

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we did was irrigation now the third

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
we did was irrigation now the third
thing<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.609> will<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> cropping

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
thing which we will do is the cropping

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470 
thing which we will do is the cropping
patterns<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.289> means<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.820> certain

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
patterns that means there are a certain

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.510 
patterns that means there are a certain
set<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> patterns<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.949> certain

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
set of patterns or there are certain

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
set of patterns or there are certain
specific<00:00:32.730> grains<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> plant

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
specific grains in which if you plant

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
specific grains in which if you plant
crops<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.340> will<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.640> better<00:00:35.850> results<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.870> let

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
crops you will get better results so let

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
crops you will get better results so let
us<00:00:37.170> talk<00:00:37.440> about<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.460> specific

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
us talk about some of those specific

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.979 
us talk about some of those specific
cropping<00:00:40.050> patterns<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> different<00:00:42.510> cropping

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
cropping patterns so different cropping

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.260 
cropping patterns so different cropping
patterns<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.770> adopted<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:45.030> better

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
patterns can be adopted for better

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
patterns can be adopted for better
results<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> cropping<00:00:46.890> patterns

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
results some of the cropping patterns

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.150 
results some of the cropping patterns
like<00:00:47.640> mixed<00:00:48.210> cropping<00:00:48.469> into<00:00:49.469> cropping<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like mixed cropping into cropping and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.000 
like mixed cropping into cropping and
crop<00:00:50.850> rotation<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
crop rotation so these are some of the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
crop rotation so these are some of the
cropping<00:00:53.280> patterns<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.149> results<00:00:54.750> in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
cropping patterns which results in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860 
cropping patterns which results in
better<00:00:55.590> yield<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:56.820> us<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.539> mixed

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
better yield so let us see what is mixed

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.130 
better yield so let us see what is mixed
cropping<00:00:58.370> growing<00:00:59.370> multiple<00:01:00.000> crops<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.719> same

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
cropping growing multiple crops on same

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.039 
cropping growing multiple crops on same
piece<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.800> land<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> term<00:01:02.820> mixed<00:01:03.120> itself<00:01:03.780> says

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
piece of land the term mixed itself says

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
piece of land the term mixed itself says
that<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.530> mixture<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.129> something<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.119> mixed

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that it is mixture of something so mixed

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.410 
that it is mixture of something so mixed
cropping<00:01:06.659> means<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.770> mixture<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> crops

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
cropping means to you a mixture of crops

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
cropping means to you a mixture of crops
that<00:01:09.659> means<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> variety<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> crops<00:01:11.010> different

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that means a variety of crops different

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
that means a variety of crops different
varieties<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> crops<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.990> grown<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.159> same

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
varieties of crops are grown on the same

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
varieties of crops are grown on the same
piece<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> land<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.710> example<00:01:17.070> here

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
piece of land look at this example here

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.990 
piece of land look at this example here
you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.659> both<00:01:18.990> barley<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> wheat

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
you can see that both barley and wheat

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.570 
you can see that both barley and wheat
here<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.890> beet<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
here you can see these are beet and here

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.830 
here you can see these are beet and here
you<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.939> these<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.270> barley

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you can see these are barley

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.899 
you can see these are barley
so<00:01:25.170> both<00:01:25.380> barley<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.009> wheat<00:01:26.070> are<00:01:26.490> grown

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so both barley and wheat are grown

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
so both barley and wheat are grown
together<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.049> land

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
together in the land

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
together in the land
so<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.280> only<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.420> shown<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so not only the here I have shown you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
so not only the here I have shown you
the<00:01:30.900> example<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> barley<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.860> wheat<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.610> only

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the example of barley and wheat not only

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.160 
the example of barley and wheat not only
barley<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.299> wheat<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.689> any<00:01:33.960> other

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
barley and wheat but any other

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
barley and wheat but any other
combination<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.979> wheat<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> gram<00:01:35.729> together

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
combination like wheat and gram together

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
combination like wheat and gram together
or<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.960> brown<00:01:37.320> dirt<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> sunflower<00:01:38.159> together

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
or a brown dirt and sunflower together

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600 
or a brown dirt and sunflower together
so<00:01:39.119> two<00:01:39.570> crops<00:01:39.900> grown<00:01:40.259> together<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> same

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so two crops grown together on the same

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
so two crops grown together on the same
piece<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> land<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.020> known<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.470> mixed

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
piece of land that is known as mixed

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
piece of land that is known as mixed
cropping<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:46.020> mixed

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cropping now how do you think mixed

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.920 
cropping now how do you think mixed
cropping<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:47.100> help<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.899> crop<00:01:48.899> production

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
cropping will help in crop production

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.910 
cropping will help in crop production
management<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.520> its<00:01:50.700> advantage<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.920> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
management so its advantage is that it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
management so its advantage is that it
gives<00:01:53.369> insurance<00:01:54.240> against<00:01:54.720> failure<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.380> one

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gives insurance against failure of one

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.100 
gives insurance against failure of one
of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> crops<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.790> let<00:01:56.939> us<00:01:56.969> suppose<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.659> we

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
of the crops now let us suppose if we

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.010 
of the crops now let us suppose if we
have<00:01:58.140> planted<00:01:58.890> both<00:01:59.189> body<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.149> wheat<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> as

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
have planted both body and wheat and as

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.800 
have planted both body and wheat and as
I<00:02:01.049> suppose<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.280> wheat<00:02:02.729> plants<00:02:03.240> failed<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I suppose the wheat plants failed that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.960 
I suppose the wheat plants failed that
means<00:02:04.049> move<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.680> wheat<00:02:04.920> plants<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.460> not

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
means move it the wheat plants do not

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.910 
means move it the wheat plants do not
proper<00:02:06.210> nutrients<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.110> they've<00:02:07.470> got<00:02:07.710> some

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
proper nutrients or they've got some

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.700 
proper nutrients or they've got some
disease<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.450> gone<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.930> at<00:02:10.560> least

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
disease and it is gone but at least

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.280 
disease and it is gone but at least
you'll<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.460> backup<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.210> body<00:02:12.450> because

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you'll have a backup of the body because

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.740 
you'll have a backup of the body because
had<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.500> been<00:02:13.650> only<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.580> monoculture<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.330> wheat

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
had it been only a monoculture of wheat

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.380 
had it been only a monoculture of wheat
in<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.170> case<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:16.590> wheat<00:02:16.920> crops<00:02:17.730> failed<00:02:18.090> that

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
in that case if wheat crops failed that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420 
in that case if wheat crops failed that
season<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:19.860> nothing<00:02:20.070> which

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
season then you will have nothing which

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.250 
season then you will have nothing which
you<00:02:20.580> could<00:02:20.760> cultivate<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.480> season<00:02:21.840> but

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
you could cultivate in that season but

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
you could cultivate in that season but
it<00:02:22.380> means<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.980> mixed<00:02:23.310> cropping<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:23.850> one

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it means if it is mixed cropping if one

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.120 
it means if it is mixed cropping if one
of<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.360> crops<00:02:24.570> failed<00:02:24.840> also<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:25.830> are<00:02:25.950> other

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
of the crops failed also there are other

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.960 
of the crops failed also there are other
crops<00:02:26.550> which<00:02:26.820> can<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> success<00:02:28.460> right<00:02:29.460> so

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
crops which can be a success right so

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.610 
crops which can be a success right so
here<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.240> get<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.720> backup<00:02:33.470> next<00:02:34.470> is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
here you get a backup next is

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.800 
here you get a backup next is
intercropping<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.210> intercropping

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
intercropping so in intercropping

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.590 
intercropping so in intercropping
growing<00:02:37.350> multiple<00:02:37.890> crops<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.520> same<00:02:38.820> field<00:02:39.209> in

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
growing multiple crops on same field in

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.870 
growing multiple crops on same field in
a<00:02:39.990> specific<00:02:40.290> pattern<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.400> mixed<00:02:41.700> cropping

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
a specific pattern so in mixed cropping

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.790 
a specific pattern so in mixed cropping
it<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> same<00:02:43.110> piece<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.560> land

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it was like on the same piece of land

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
it was like on the same piece of land
you<00:02:43.980> somewhere<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.670> weeds<00:02:45.090> somewhere

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you somewhere you have weeds somewhere

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.270 
you somewhere you have weeds somewhere
you<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.630> body<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.740> when<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.070> talk<00:02:47.250> of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you have body but when we talk of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.699 
you have body but when we talk of
intercropping<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.660> will<00:02:48.780> arrange<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.500> wheat

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
intercropping you will arrange the wheat

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.250 
intercropping you will arrange the wheat
plants<00:02:50.280> in<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.850> specific<00:02:51.060> pattern<00:02:51.570> again<00:02:52.140> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
plants in a specific pattern again you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.130 
plants in a specific pattern again you
will<00:02:52.350> arrange<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.920> bad<00:02:53.209> Bily<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.600> specific

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
will arrange the bad Bily in a specific

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.260 
will arrange the bad Bily in a specific
pattern<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> specific<00:02:56.280> pattern<00:02:56.520> has<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.180> be

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
pattern so a specific pattern has to be

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.110 
pattern so a specific pattern has to be
followed<00:02:57.990> crops<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.280> be<00:02:59.310> chosen<00:02:59.670> such<00:03:00.060> that

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
followed crops to be chosen such that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.270 
followed crops to be chosen such that
their<00:03:00.660> nutrient<00:03:01.260> requirements<00:03:02.130> are

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
their nutrient requirements are

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.120 
their nutrient requirements are
different<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.570> why<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.110> think<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.740> need<00:03:04.920> to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
different so why do you think we need to

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.890 
different so why do you think we need to
choose<00:03:05.400> such<00:03:05.730> crops<00:03:06.030> whose<00:03:06.360> nutrient

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
choose such crops whose nutrient

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.720 
choose such crops whose nutrient
requirements<00:03:07.650> are<00:03:07.770> different<00:03:07.920> that's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
requirements are different that's

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.000 
requirements are different that's
because<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.810> choose<00:03:10.080> two<00:03:10.440> crops<00:03:10.769> which

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
because if they choose two crops which

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.009 
because if they choose two crops which
have<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.459> same<00:03:11.489> nutrient<00:03:12.209> requirements<00:03:12.840> then

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
have the same nutrient requirements then

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.750 
have the same nutrient requirements then
they<00:03:13.110> both<00:03:13.320> will<00:03:13.650> start<00:03:13.950> fighting<00:03:14.250> amongst

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
they both will start fighting amongst

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.270 
they both will start fighting amongst
each<00:03:14.880> other<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:16.050> get<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.290> nutrients<00:03:16.890> from<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
each other to get the nutrients from the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.640 
each other to get the nutrients from the
soil<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.030> competition<00:03:18.750> will<00:03:18.930> arise<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
soil so competition will arise and as a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.520 
soil so competition will arise and as a
result<00:03:20.130> they<00:03:20.310> will<00:03:20.459> not<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.820> able<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.180> grow

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
result they will not be able to grow

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.380 
result they will not be able to grow
healthy<00:03:22.530> enough<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.670> why<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
healthy enough so that is why we have to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060 
healthy enough so that is why we have to
choose<00:03:24.570> crops<00:03:25.050> whose<00:03:25.260> three<00:03:25.440> nutrient

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
choose crops whose three nutrient

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.040 
choose crops whose three nutrient
requirements<00:03:26.790> are<00:03:26.910> different<00:03:27.030> maybe<00:03:27.780> one

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
requirements are different maybe one

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.780 
requirements are different maybe one
crop<00:03:28.350> needs<00:03:28.590> more<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.040> phosphorous<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.700> other

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
crop needs more of phosphorous the other

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.540 
crop needs more of phosphorous the other
crop<00:03:30.450> needs<00:03:30.630> role<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.140> nitrogen<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:31.890> they<00:03:32.370> will

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
crop needs role of nitrogen so they will

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.910 
crop needs role of nitrogen so they will
have<00:03:32.700> different<00:03:32.910> requirements<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.920> their

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
have different requirements so their

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.080 
have different requirements so their
requirements<00:03:35.580> can<00:03:35.790> be<00:03:35.970> fulfilled<00:03:36.299> as<00:03:36.840> well<00:03:38.090> so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
requirements can be fulfilled as well so

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.420 
requirements can be fulfilled as well so
let<00:03:39.299> us<00:03:39.330> look<00:03:39.630> at<00:03:39.870> an<00:03:40.080> example<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
let us look at an example so here you

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.220 
let us look at an example so here you
can<00:03:41.580> see<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.360> field<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.900> have

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
can see that in this field you have

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.190 
can see that in this field you have
coconut<00:03:43.980> trees<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.459> well<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
coconut trees as well as you have the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.740 
coconut trees as well as you have the
marigold<00:03:46.830> plants<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:48.000> see<00:03:48.209> here<00:03:48.540> that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
marigold plants so you can see here that

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.350 
marigold plants so you can see here that
even<00:03:48.959> here<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.860> both<00:03:50.519> coconut<00:03:51.120> trees

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
even here you have both coconut trees

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.900 
even here you have both coconut trees
and<00:03:51.600> marigold<00:03:52.590> plant<00:03:52.739> but<00:03:53.130> here<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> coconut

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
and marigold plant but here the coconut

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.670 
and marigold plant but here the coconut
trees<00:03:54.150> are<00:03:54.330> arranged<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> specific<00:03:54.959> pattern

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
trees are arranged in a specific pattern

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.699 
trees are arranged in a specific pattern
they're<00:03:56.100> arranged<00:03:56.549> in<00:03:56.640> specific<00:03:57.239> rows<00:03:57.709> right

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
they're arranged in specific rows right

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.250 
they're arranged in specific rows right
so<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.430> kind<00:03:59.820> of<00:04:00.000> specific<00:04:00.570> patterns<00:04:01.080> are

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
so these kind of specific patterns are

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.180 
so these kind of specific patterns are
known<00:04:01.590> as<00:04:01.769> inter<00:04:02.370> cropping<00:04:02.850> or<00:04:04.010> similarly<00:04:05.010> on

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
known as inter cropping or similarly on

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.710 
known as inter cropping or similarly on
maybe<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:06.150> later<00:04:06.360> suppose<00:04:06.660> you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
maybe you can have later suppose you

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.229 
maybe you can have later suppose you
have<00:04:06.870> soybean<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.620> maize<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.910> one

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
have soybean and maize so you have one

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.410 
have soybean and maize so you have one
row<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.660> soya<00:04:09.930> bean<00:04:10.489> again<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.880> have<00:04:12.030> one<00:04:12.239> row

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
row of soya bean again you have one row

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.050 
row of soya bean again you have one row
of<00:04:12.570> means<00:04:12.890> again<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.220> one<00:04:14.430> row<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.819> soya

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
of means again you have one row of soya

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.320 
of means again you have one row of soya
bean<00:04:15.500> again<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.190> row<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.520> means<00:04:17.789> so

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
bean again you have one row of means so

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.699 
bean again you have one row of means so
this<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.660> how<00:04:18.870> intercrop

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
this is how intercrop

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.129 
this is how intercrop
instead<00:04:20.579> what<00:04:21.239> are<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.479> advantages<00:04:21.989> of

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
instead what are the advantages of

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.730 
instead what are the advantages of
intercropping<00:04:23.840> here<00:04:24.840> maximum<00:04:25.319> utilization

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
intercropping here maximum utilization

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.189 
intercropping here maximum utilization
of<00:04:26.340> nutrients<00:04:26.970> that's<00:04:27.120> because<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.020> have

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
of nutrients that's because you have

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.140 
of nutrients that's because you have
planted<00:04:28.740> multiple<00:04:29.280> crops<00:04:29.550> who<00:04:29.759> have<00:04:29.910> multiple

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
planted multiple crops who have multiple

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.510 
planted multiple crops who have multiple
different<00:04:30.870> requirements<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:31.710> each<00:04:32.099> of<00:04:32.310> them

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
different requirements so each of them

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.700 
different requirements so each of them
will<00:04:32.729> get<00:04:32.970> their<00:04:33.270> own<00:04:33.300> requirements<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.349> as<00:04:34.680> a

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
will get their own requirements and as a

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.800 
will get their own requirements and as a
result<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.610> nutrients<00:04:36.180> which<00:04:36.330> are<00:04:36.419> present

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
result the nutrients which are present

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.990 
result the nutrients which are present
in<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.020> soil<00:04:37.229> will<00:04:37.830> all<00:04:38.039> be<00:04:38.220> utilized<00:04:38.699> for

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
in the soil will all be utilized for

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.629 
in the soil will all be utilized for
example<00:04:39.810> if<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.259> have<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.770> monoculture<00:04:41.430> of

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
example if you have a monoculture of

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.059 
example if you have a monoculture of
meat<00:04:42.000> then<00:04:42.630> suppose<00:04:43.020> Beach<00:04:43.229> needs<00:04:43.590> some

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
meat then suppose Beach needs some

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.830 
meat then suppose Beach needs some
specific<00:04:44.580> nutrients<00:04:45.180> some<00:04:45.449> fortified

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
specific nutrients some fortified

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.719 
specific nutrients some fortified
nutrients<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.770> only<00:04:46.949> those<00:04:47.220> four<00:04:47.520> five

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
nutrients so only those four five

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.700 
nutrients so only those four five
nutrients<00:04:48.330> will<00:04:48.449> be<00:04:48.539> utilized<00:04:48.990> from<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.470> soil

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
nutrients will be utilized from the soil

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.070 
nutrients will be utilized from the soil
but<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:50.880> an<00:04:51.150> inter<00:04:51.449> cropping<00:04:51.900> of

its own set of other requirements so
both<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.060> them<00:05:03.419> will<00:05:03.479> derive<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.169> nutrients

spreading of pests and disease how

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.920 
spreading of pests and disease how
because<00:05:14.580> since<00:05:14.820> there<00:05:15.090> are<00:05:15.270> two<00:05:15.509> different

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
disease will spread to the coconut plant

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.499 
disease will spread to the coconut plant
as<00:05:40.889> well<00:05:41.070> right<00:05:41.789> because<00:05:42.120> they<00:05:42.300> have

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
as well right because they have

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.640 
as well right because they have
different<00:05:42.780> requirements<00:05:43.620> different

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
different requirements different

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.670 
different requirements different
properties<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.509> prevents<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.349> spreading

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
properties so it prevents the spreading

pre-planned succession that means you

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.020 
pre-planned succession that means you
here<00:06:01.740> also<00:06:01.979> we<00:06:02.219> will<00:06:02.370> grow<00:06:02.580> different<00:06:02.969> crops

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
here also we will grow different crops

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.330 
here also we will grow different crops
on<00:06:03.449> the<00:06:03.479> same<00:06:03.750> land<00:06:04.050> but<00:06:04.650> now<00:06:04.860> we<00:06:04.919> will<00:06:05.190> not

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
on the same land but now we will not

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.089 
on the same land but now we will not
draw<00:06:05.580> them<00:06:05.789> together<00:06:05.969> some<00:06:06.780> some<00:06:07.530> one<00:06:07.860> plant

we<00:06:10.320> go<00:06:10.469> some<00:06:10.710> other<00:06:10.830> plant<00:06:11.219> now<00:06:11.699> there<00:06:11.969> also

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
we go some other plant now there also

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.420

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
crop we need to

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.020 
crop we need to
cultivate<00:06:32.550> let<00:06:32.730> us<00:06:32.880> look<00:06:33.030> at<00:06:33.240> this<00:06:33.450> example

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
cultivate let us look at this example

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.880 
cultivate let us look at this example
let<00:06:36.030> us<00:06:36.060> take<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.450> example<00:06:36.930> of<00:06:37.080> cotton<00:06:37.650> and

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
let us take the example of cotton and

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.030 
let us take the example of cotton and
peanuts<00:06:38.460> now<00:06:39.120> cotton<00:06:39.630> are<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:40.140> crops<00:06:40.440> which

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
peanuts now cotton are the crops which

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.100 
peanuts now cotton are the crops which
actually<00:06:41.460> depletes<00:06:41.910> the<00:06:42.180> soil<00:06:42.420> that<00:06:42.720> means<00:06:42.900> it

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
actually depletes the soil that means it

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.530 
actually depletes the soil that means it
takes<00:06:43.140> away<00:06:43.950> other<00:06:44.400> layer<00:06:44.610> of<00:06:44.790> soil<00:06:44.970> that<00:06:45.390> is

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
takes away other layer of soil that is

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.540 
takes away other layer of soil that is
called<00:06:45.720> swine<00:06:45.930> depletion<00:06:46.560> so<00:06:47.100> cotton

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
called swine depletion so cotton

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.970 
called swine depletion so cotton
depletes<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.270> layer<00:06:48.450> of<00:06:48.630> soil<00:06:48.980> whereas

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
depletes the layer of soil whereas

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.150 
depletes the layer of soil whereas
peanuts<00:06:50.580> or<00:06:50.850> peas<00:06:51.150> they<00:06:51.780> enrich<00:06:52.380> the<00:06:52.650> soil<00:06:52.680> so

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
peanuts or peas they enrich the soil so

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.800 
peanuts or peas they enrich the soil so
that<00:06:53.310> means<00:06:53.520> later<00:06:53.760> suppose<00:06:54.150> if<00:06:54.360> we<00:06:54.540> plant

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
that means later suppose if we plant

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.770 
that means later suppose if we plant
cotton<00:06:55.190> for<00:06:56.190> some<00:06:56.400> time<00:06:56.610> so<00:06:57.180> what<00:06:57.330> will<00:06:57.510> happen

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
cotton for some time so what will happen

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.560 
cotton for some time so what will happen
the<00:06:57.870> soil<00:06:58.170> will<00:06:58.380> get<00:06:58.590> completely<00:06:59.160> depleted

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
the soil will get completely depleted

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.210 
the soil will get completely depleted
immediately<00:07:00.570> after<00:07:00.870> cotton<00:07:01.320> we<00:07:01.740> should<00:07:01.920> plant

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
immediately after cotton we should plant

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.280 
immediately after cotton we should plant
peas<00:07:02.610> or<00:07:02.910> peanuts<00:07:03.360> so<00:07:03.660> that<00:07:03.840> they<00:07:04.020> will<00:07:04.140> enrich

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
peas or peanuts so that they will enrich

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.620 
peas or peanuts so that they will enrich
the<00:07:04.710> soil<00:07:04.740> again<00:07:05.250> now<00:07:05.880> once<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.270> soil<00:07:06.390> is

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
the soil again now once the soil is

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.540 
the soil again now once the soil is
enriched<00:07:06.960> and<00:07:07.140> again<00:07:07.770> the<00:07:07.920> cultivation<00:07:08.400> of

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
enriched and again the cultivation of

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.640 
enriched and again the cultivation of
peas<00:07:08.790> and<00:07:08.910> peanuts<00:07:09.420> are<00:07:09.570> done<00:07:09.750> then<00:07:10.170> again<00:07:10.440> we

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
peas and peanuts are done then again we

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.290 
peas and peanuts are done then again we
should<00:07:10.830> cultivate<00:07:11.040> cotton<00:07:11.670> so<00:07:11.940> that<00:07:12.090> again

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
should cultivate cotton so that again

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.630 
should cultivate cotton so that again
that<00:07:12.780> means<00:07:12.900> whatever<00:07:13.380> loss<00:07:13.830> is<00:07:14.100> happening

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
that means whatever loss is happening

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.730 
that means whatever loss is happening
due<00:07:14.760> to<00:07:14.790> cotton<00:07:15.300> it<00:07:15.540> is<00:07:15.870> covered<00:07:16.290> up<00:07:16.530> by

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
due to cotton it is covered up by

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.010 
due to cotton it is covered up by
peanuts<00:07:17.160> and<00:07:17.370> peas<00:07:17.580> so<00:07:18.030> they<00:07:18.210> become<00:07:18.600> a<00:07:18.780> good

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 
peanuts and peas so they become a good

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.490 
peanuts and peas so they become a good
pair<00:07:19.380> for<00:07:20.340> crop<00:07:20.880> rotation<00:07:21.420> so<00:07:21.720> first<00:07:21.990> you<00:07:22.230> do

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
pair for crop rotation so first you do

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.470 
pair for crop rotation so first you do
first<00:07:23.100> you<00:07:23.220> grow<00:07:23.460> this<00:07:23.640> crop<00:07:23.850> and<00:07:24.180> then<00:07:24.300> you

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:24.480 
first you grow this crop and then you

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.050 
first you grow this crop and then you
grow<00:07:24.690> the<00:07:25.140> other<00:07:25.350> crop<00:07:25.710> because<00:07:26.250> it<00:07:26.430> has<00:07:26.700> some

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
grow the other crop because it has some

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.840 
grow the other crop because it has some
additional<00:07:27.420> advantages<00:07:28.380> so<00:07:28.890> this<00:07:29.280> is<00:07:29.460> crop

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
additional advantages so this is crop

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.210 
additional advantages so this is crop
rotation<00:07:30.330> so<00:07:30.480> these<00:07:30.630> are<00:07:30.930> the<00:07:31.140> three<00:07:31.410> ways<00:07:31.440> by

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
rotation so these are the three ways by

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.660 
rotation so these are the three ways by
which<00:07:32.250> we<00:07:32.820> can<00:07:33.440> do<00:07:34.440> cropping<00:07:35.100> in<00:07:35.310> a<00:07:35.460> better

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670 
which we can do cropping in a better

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.640 
which we can do cropping in a better
manner<00:07:35.940> that<00:07:36.600> is<00:07:38.120> mixed<00:07:39.120> cropping

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650 
manner that is mixed cropping

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.390
