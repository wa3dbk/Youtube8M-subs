you add up all those details you got the

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:10.299 
you add up all those details you got the
you<00:05:09.019> got<00:05:09.169> a<00:05:09.199> few<00:05:09.469> challenges<00:05:09.649> you<00:05:09.860> get<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:10.009> brand

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:10.309 
you got a few challenges you get a brand

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.799 
you got a few challenges you get a brand
new<00:05:10.459> map<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:10.909> then<00:05:10.999> built<00:05:11.179> the<00:05:11.300> ability<00:05:11.779> to

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:11.809 
new map and then built the ability to

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.269 
new map and then built the ability to
skate<00:05:12.110> at<00:05:12.229> nighttime<00:05:12.439> which<00:05:12.739> is<00:05:12.860> something<00:05:13.039> I

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:13.279 
skate at nighttime which is something I

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.219 
skate at nighttime which is something I
think<00:05:13.309> it's<00:05:13.819> long<00:05:14.089> coming<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.779> I<00:05:14.839> think<00:05:14.899> that

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
think it's long coming and I think that

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.979 
think it's long coming and I think that
was<00:05:15.379> really<00:05:15.589> cool<00:05:16.239> now<00:05:17.239> all<00:05:17.479> they<00:05:17.599> need<00:05:17.779> to<00:05:17.809> do

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:17.989 
was really cool now all they need to do

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:19.629 
was really cool now all they need to do
for<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.229> next<00:05:18.349> skate<00:05:18.679> game<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.069> to<00:05:19.219> make<00:05:19.249> it<00:05:19.519> so

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
for the next skate game is to make it so

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.459 
for the next skate game is to make it so
that<00:05:19.669> time<00:05:20.239> shifts<00:05:20.839> in<00:05:20.989> the<00:05:21.110> regular

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
that time shifts in the regular

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:22.839 
that time shifts in the regular
atmosphere<00:05:22.069> anyway<00:05:22.399> you<00:05:22.459> know<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.759> the

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
atmosphere anyway you know in the

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.879 
atmosphere anyway you know in the
regular<00:05:23.119> level<00:05:23.389> it'll<00:05:24.259> eventually<00:05:24.469> become

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
regular level it'll eventually become

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.859 
regular level it'll eventually become
nighttime<00:05:25.279> but<00:05:25.819> not<00:05:25.939> every<00:05:26.300> minute<00:05:26.569> like

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:26.869 
nighttime but not every minute like

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:28.899 
nighttime but not every minute like
don't<00:05:27.319> make<00:05:27.409> it<00:05:27.529> like<00:05:27.649> GTA<00:05:27.829> where<00:05:28.309> every

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
don't make it like GTA where every

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.189 
don't make it like GTA where every
minute<00:05:29.179> is<00:05:29.269> an<00:05:29.389> hour<00:05:29.509> that's<00:05:29.839> just<00:05:30.019> retarded

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
minute is an hour that's just retarded

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.029 
minute is an hour that's just retarded
but<00:05:31.989> yeah<00:05:32.989> it's<00:05:33.169> probably<00:05:33.259> a<00:05:33.469> good<00:05:33.529> idea<00:05:33.589> to<00:05:33.889> do

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
but yeah it's probably a good idea to do

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.689 
but yeah it's probably a good idea to do
that<00:05:35.019> anyways<00:05:36.019> yeah<00:05:36.979> so<00:05:37.219> you<00:05:37.339> got<00:05:37.459> that<00:05:37.579> you

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
that anyways yeah so you got that you

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.639 
that anyways yeah so you got that you
got<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.939> dark<00:05:38.149> the<00:05:38.360> new<00:05:38.479> setting<00:05:38.869> pretty<00:05:39.469> big

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.649 
got the dark the new setting pretty big

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.059 
got the dark the new setting pretty big
map<00:05:39.860> very<00:05:40.699> big<00:05:40.939> map<00:05:41.119> actually<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:42.069> considering

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
map very big map actually it considering

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.579 
map very big map actually it considering
it<00:05:43.129> was<00:05:43.219> free<00:05:43.459> it's<00:05:44.269> pretty<00:05:44.479> big<00:05:44.659> map<00:05:44.869> but

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:45.589 
it was free it's pretty big map but

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:46.959 
it was free it's pretty big map but
there<00:05:45.739> is<00:05:45.829> a<00:05:45.860> lack<00:05:46.069> of<00:05:46.129> challenges<00:05:46.729> I'm<00:05:46.849> not

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
there is a lack of challenges I'm not

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.209 
there is a lack of challenges I'm not
saying<00:05:47.239> that's<00:05:47.329> a<00:05:47.509> bad<00:05:47.539> thing<00:05:47.869> but<00:05:48.469> yes<00:05:48.709> again

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
saying that's a bad thing but yes again

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.889 
saying that's a bad thing but yes again
it<00:05:49.489> kind<00:05:49.729> of<00:05:49.879> is<00:05:50.089> because<00:05:50.360> some<00:05:50.509> people<00:05:50.539> play

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:50.899 
it kind of is because some people play

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:52.839 
it kind of is because some people play
this<00:05:51.050> game<00:05:51.259> meet<00:05:51.559> merely<00:05:52.039> for<00:05:52.309> the<00:05:52.369> challenges

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
this game meet merely for the challenges

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.479 
this game meet merely for the challenges
so<00:05:53.319> there's<00:05:54.319> a<00:05:54.409> lack<00:05:54.649> of<00:05:54.709> challenges<00:05:55.339> there

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:55.489 
so there's a lack of challenges there

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:59.499 
so there's a lack of challenges there
was<00:05:55.579> only<00:05:55.699> a<00:05:55.819> total<00:05:56.779> of<00:05:56.869> four<00:05:57.909> one<00:05:58.909> film<00:05:59.239> one

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
photo and two on the spot and yeah

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:05.439 
photo and two on the spot and yeah
that's<00:06:04.399> the<00:06:04.489> only<00:06:04.699> thing<00:06:04.849> I<00:06:04.999> have<00:06:05.089> to<00:06:05.149> say<00:06:05.389> you

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:06.999 
that's the only thing I have to say you
know<00:06:05.599> it's<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.169> lack<00:06:06.349> of<00:06:06.379> challenges<00:06:06.889> so

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
know it's a lack of challenges so

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.319 
know it's a lack of challenges so
that'll<00:06:07.249> bring<00:06:07.339> the<00:06:07.429> sport<00:06:07.789> now<00:06:07.909> whole<00:06:08.119> but

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:08.329 
that'll bring the sport now whole but

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.409 
that'll bring the sport now whole but
but<00:06:08.839> because<00:06:09.050> this<00:06:09.619> DLC<00:06:10.039> was<00:06:10.429> free<00:06:10.879> and<00:06:11.149> some

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
but because this DLC was free and some

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:12.879 
but because this DLC was free and some
amount<00:06:11.569> of<00:06:11.719> shit<00:06:11.839> you<00:06:11.959> do<00:06:12.139> get<00:06:12.379> for<00:06:12.649> it

I'm probably going to give it a 7 point
5<00:06:15.610> mainly<00:06:16.610> if<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.789> wasn't<00:06:17.149> free<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.449> yet<00:06:17.539> to

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:27.439 
said the lot itself isn't enough to make

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.040 
said the lot itself isn't enough to make
up<00:06:27.739> for<00:06:28.009> points<00:06:28.489> since<00:06:29.149> it<00:06:29.269> was<00:06:29.389> free<00:06:29.539> I<00:06:29.659> got<00:06:29.929> to
