because<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.600> having<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> c-section<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.710> we

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
because I was having a c-section and we

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
because I was having a c-section and we
had<00:00:56.039> no<00:00:56.250> idea<00:00:56.579> how<00:00:57.239> long<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
had no idea how long it would take to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010 
had no idea how long it would take to
recover<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> would<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.780> able

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
recover and if I would be you know able

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.689 
recover and if I would be you know able
to<00:01:01.170> care<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> infant<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.579> I'd

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to care for the infant as much as I'd

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.080 
to care for the infant as much as I'd
like<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.920> decided<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
like to also we decided to do it because

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.990 
like to also we decided to do it because
we<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.110> anything<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.619> babies<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we don't know anything about babies so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.899 
we don't know anything about babies so
so<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.930> figured<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.400> great<00:01:11.760> idea

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so we figured it was a really great idea

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.170 
so we figured it was a really great idea
to<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> walking<00:01:13.680> encyclopedia<00:01:13.970> with<00:01:14.970> us

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to have a walking encyclopedia with us

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.899 
to have a walking encyclopedia with us
every<00:01:15.479> evening<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.500> help<00:01:17.369> us<00:01:17.490> answer

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
every evening to help us answer

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
every evening to help us answer
questions<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.570> had<00:01:18.750> during<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> day<00:01:19.280> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
questions that we had during the day and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
questions that we had during the day and
there<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> things<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.780> look

there are a lot of things you can look

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.940 
there are a lot of things you can look
up<00:01:22.049> when<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.290> read<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.799> books

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
up when we read a lot of books

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
up when we read a lot of books
beforehand<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.270> know

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
beforehand but you just don't know

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.240 
beforehand but you just don't know
anything<00:01:24.900> until<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.560> baby<00:01:25.710> comes<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.159> the

anything until the baby comes into the
world<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> reason<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.100> decided

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
world so that was the reason we decided

came<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.470> during<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.009> day

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
came up during the day

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.539 
came up during the day
absolutely<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.829> helpful<00:01:47.130> too

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
absolutely and it was very helpful too

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
absolutely and it was very helpful too
because<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.509> nighttime<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.290> knew<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.860> going

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
because at nighttime I knew I was going

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.710 
because at nighttime I knew I was going
to<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> wake<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.579> anyway<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> breastfeed

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
to have to wake up anyway to breastfeed

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
to have to wake up anyway to breastfeed
but<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.100> amount<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> spent<00:01:54.270> being

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
but the amount of time I spent being

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.380 
but the amount of time I spent being
awake<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.770> shorter<00:01:55.799> because

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
awake was so much shorter because

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.880
