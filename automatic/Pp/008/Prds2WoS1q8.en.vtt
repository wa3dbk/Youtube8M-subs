I've easily spent more time with this
series<00:00:40.890> than<00:00:41.100> any<00:00:41.430> other<00:00:41.880> over<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> years<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
series than any other over the years and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.580 
series than any other over the years and
I<00:00:43.620> still<00:00:43.860> feel<00:00:44.219> joy<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.079> beginning<00:00:46.440> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
I still feel joy at the beginning of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
I still feel joy at the beginning of
every<00:00:47.010> single<00:00:47.370> game<00:00:47.610> especially<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
every single game especially that that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
every single game especially that that
first<00:00:48.989> hour<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> first<00:00:49.980> hour<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
first hour that first hour of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.650 
first hour that first hour of
civilization<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> best<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.370> I

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
civilization is still the best and I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
civilization is still the best and I
enjoy<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:55.350> dissecting<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
enjoy it over dissecting the way it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
enjoy it over dissecting the way it
works<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> mathematical<00:00:58.710> level<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
works at a mathematical level and this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
works at a mathematical level and this
is<00:00:59.610> probably<00:00:59.850> why<00:01:00.239> even<00:01:01.050> though<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> series

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is probably why even though I'm a series

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.180 
is probably why even though I'm a series
fan<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:03.420> freak<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.140> every<00:01:04.649> single<00:01:04.800> time

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
fan I don't freak out every single time

a new version comes along because the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
a new version comes along because the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
on top of each other and then just

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.020 
on top of each other and then just
pushing<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> forward<00:01:54.689> across<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.399> continents

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pushing it forward across the continents

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
pushing it forward across the continents
and<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:58.170> was<00:01:58.610> not<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.320> good<00:02:01.320> tactic<00:02:01.890> her

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and it was not a good tactic her

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450 
and it was not a good tactic her
strategy<00:02:02.790> game<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.409> people<00:02:04.560> had<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.040> relearn

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
strategy game so people had to relearn

strategies<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.899> civilization<00:02:07.890> 5<00:02:08.070> which<00:02:08.280> only

allows you to have one person per tile

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.050 
allows you to have one person per tile
instead<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.940> making<00:02:12.090> these

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
instead of just making these

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.690
