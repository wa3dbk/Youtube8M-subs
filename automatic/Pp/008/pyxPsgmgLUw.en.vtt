00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.780
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.059
 the orange blossom 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 I hope you all go well then 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.300
 today we are going to make small 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.859
 soft cakes with almonds 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 you can replace the blacks the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.600
 fines by any other fruits 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 like hazelnuts nuts or 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.189
 really pecan when you want 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.900
 so we start by whipping the eggs 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.399
 whole with sugar you can 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 use a fake electric if you 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.719
 want because we want to get a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.239
 mixture well well sparkling thereafter 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.739
 as long as we add a butter 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.040
 molten 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.989
 125 g melted butter almonds in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 125 g powder also 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.180
 so we're going to mix and we'll add 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 the flour 150 g of flour and a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 tablespoon of baking soda 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.829
 that you can replace with yeast 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 chemical m 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.910
 so I keep mixing and I forget 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.390
 not the little pinch of salt always 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.500
 in the authorities cakes at this room 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.050
 I also add two spoons to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.510
 liquid cream soup and I put it back 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.760

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.920

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.900
 minutes cooking more than 20 minutes 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.750
