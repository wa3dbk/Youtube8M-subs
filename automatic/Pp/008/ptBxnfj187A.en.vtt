CD that you've put in if a dialog

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.490 
CD that you've put in if a dialog
similar<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.359> this<00:03:13.480> one<00:03:13.689> appears<00:03:14.109> you<00:03:14.469> can

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
similar to this one appears you can

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.240 
similar to this one appears you can
simply<00:03:15.010> click<00:03:15.189> yes<00:03:16.109> once<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.319> blue<00:03:17.500> bar<00:03:17.769> stops

simply click yes once the blue bar stops
moving<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.940> then<00:03:19.150> know<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.389> it's<00:03:19.659> face

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
moving you then know that it's face

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.170 
moving you then know that it's face
calculating<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.579> check<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:21.879> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
calculating you can check that the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.000 
calculating you can check that the
number<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.569> files<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.079> correct<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.889> has

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
number of files is correct that it has

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.710 
number of files is correct that it has
included<00:03:24.489> all<00:03:24.669> of<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:24.879> video<00:03:25.150> files<00:03:25.419> that<00:03:25.569> you

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
included all of the video files that you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.140 
included all of the video files that you
want<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.139> folder<00:03:26.500> as<00:03:26.799> we<00:03:27.639> can<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
want in that folder as we can see the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.439 
want in that folder as we can see the
total<00:03:28.389> file<00:03:28.900> size<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:30.010> number<00:03:30.449> some

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
total file size is that number some

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.599 
total file size is that number some
forty-eight<00:03:31.930> million<00:03:32.139> bytes<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:33.340> free

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
forty-eight million bytes and the free

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.240 
forty-eight million bytes and the free
space<00:03:33.909> is<00:03:34.150> much<00:03:34.389> more<00:03:34.720> than<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:36.069> can

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
space is much more than that but we can

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.339 
space is much more than that but we can
see<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.430> taking<00:03:36.549> up<00:03:36.760> seven<00:03:37.090> percent<00:03:37.479> so<00:03:38.169> we

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
see it's taking up seven percent so we

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.020 
see it's taking up seven percent so we
now<00:03:38.530> know<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.979> we<00:03:39.069> have<00:03:39.220> enough<00:03:39.459> space<00:03:39.609> on

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
now know that we have enough space on

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.569 
now know that we have enough space on
our<00:03:40.120> media<00:03:40.540> once<00:03:41.349> you've<00:03:41.560> done<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.799> the

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
our media once you've done that the

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.509 
our media once you've done that the
device<00:03:43.180> tab<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.109> options<00:03:44.530> tab<00:03:44.859> and

device tab and the options tab and

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.189 
device tab and the options tab and
almost<00:03:45.790> always<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.239> kept<00:03:46.479> the<00:03:46.659> same<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.169> I

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
almost always be kept the same so I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.689 
almost always be kept the same so I
wouldn't<00:03:47.530> go<00:03:47.680> messing<00:03:47.979> about<00:03:48.069> with<00:03:48.189> that<00:03:48.489> like

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
wouldn't go messing about with that like

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.839 
wouldn't go messing about with that like
a<00:03:48.729> stay<00:03:49.090> at<00:03:49.150> default<00:03:49.799> however<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.069> labels<00:03:51.549> tab

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
a stay at default however the labels tab

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.809 
a stay at default however the labels tab
you<00:03:52.299> can<00:03:52.509> give<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.169> volume<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.889> name<00:03:54.189> so<00:03:54.699> your

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
you can give the volume a name so your

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.179 
you can give the volume a name so your
CD<00:03:55.299> has<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.509> name<00:03:55.810> for<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.470> purposes<00:03:57.009> of<00:03:57.069> this

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189
