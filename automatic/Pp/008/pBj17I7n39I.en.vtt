00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
so if indeed the West has gone out

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.420 
so if indeed the West has gone out
declaring<00:03:13.310> war<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.670> terror<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.830> now<00:03:15.830> we<00:03:15.890> see

from<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.500> earth<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:28.220> would<00:03:28.280> appear<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.850> be

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
from the earth this would appear to be

from the earth this would appear to be
world<00:03:29.840> war<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:31.280> he's<00:03:31.520> given<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:31.910> large<00:03:32.150> weapon

any number of possibilities there but if

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.530 
any number of possibilities there but if

the first seal is open then the next

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.700 
the first seal is open then the next
seal<00:03:38.750> certainly<00:03:39.500> would<00:03:39.710> be<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.070> one<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.460> come
