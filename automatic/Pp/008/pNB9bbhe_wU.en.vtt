00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.810

 Hmm 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.240

 an an 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.150
 me 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.690
 al 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.260
 uh 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.550
 Yeah Eeeeeeeeee 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.030
 Great 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030
 Yup 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.530
 Hello Guitars station here of the guitar where I am this time to introduce 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.180
 fender custom shop master built of the series 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.220
 1966 Stratocaster Derrick 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.900
 Black body a master build one side roller 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.270
 So-called 66-year specifications 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.500
 One that I made by Porora of hand by the order of the production base in our shop 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.370
 Is quite 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.620
 Since the specs stuck to this guitar are full, I will introduce it around 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.500
 I think 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.010
 First of all the book in this body is black 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.220
 The finish has been applied but from the elaborate elbow 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.710
 What 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.430
 Finished quite thin but I think that you can you can see because the other 9 minutes wearing 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.490
 I am 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.800
 A hands now of the master builder for this guitar 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.190
 Because it is made to get a little body of rw original meeting of those days 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:45.430
 Since the material and the material and the same as the specs at the Alder body two-piece 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:48.520
 I'm using, but thin enough to stand out is part of the grain of Naa there around here grain decided 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.790
 I think you can see these things being finished 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 It is also really the vibration of the body 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.050
 Since a place to come involved I think that it also affects fairly sound, but this 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.540
 The circle symbolizes the present fender 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:05.160
 a pace of master builder 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.930
 I think it is a specification that symbolizes the height of technology, so check this later by all means 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.170
 I think it is the point I want you to do 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:17.959
 And from the pickguard of the Eco It is part of the assembly of a pickup 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 When it comes to pickguards, it is processed with nepa ground and melted with some derrick. 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.690
 It's a 3-ply pickguard, but it's a Fat Sixties pickup 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.920
 Extracting pickup 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.400
 Pads not sold for so-called master build pickups only 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.690
 It's pickup, which are made of hand-round called Six Tees 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 eh 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.319
 As it was born in recent years , even a chin build 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 It is sometimes used in so-called tax reduction models and such models. 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.579
 Master-builder Poe-roller's guitar 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.180
 Adopted in the order form we made the order is also dependent on this guitar 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.329
 I will 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.079
 Pretty fleshy finish 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.870
 I would like you to longer check come here to us by flipping the system sound 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.959
 There is a place 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.370
 And it is the setting of this bridge 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:10.900
 Porola Originally But Well Kendrick Cherry 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.510
 It's quite young but I got the technology and now it's a master build 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.500
 I became a marsaverna 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.540
 If the builder is what those of polo error Hey builder but these were of the arm 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:27.010
 It is setting Toka really original Eemaa Kendrick itself to play b 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.329
 Also we have a but Pau that was a builder who was made for the artist 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.780
 The rollers are pretty 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.500
 It is the setting of the meeting of playability or something like this to the instrument brain 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.750
 Well, but it has been in Puroti ring also 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:42.170
 The goodness of the pitch and quite a bit about the proposed setup for setting up such adjustments 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.400
 I think this is a great builder, so by all means track like this 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:50.209
 Even if you say it to the caster, it really only differs from the setup and such 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.240
 Because the sound is quite elaborate, so check it here too 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.640
 I think it is the point I want 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:01.680
 And volume and part of the Kano sound tone of now 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.450
 Adopted a small number type as the bin bottom series 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.800
 Impressions from the bridge piece Patent bend so-called this 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.580
 It is a long type to 3 and a little big , so I use something like cats 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.950
 Well, check it out because it is a part that really affects stealing characters 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.130
 please 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.330
 And the most important thing is this finger board 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.200
 As for finger boards, it is 66 specs of course Rose finger boards 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.200
 Mound's Association 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.330
 Etc. of laminate 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.810
 It becomes a rose finger board, but I think that you can understand if you look from here 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.380
 But 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:41.720
 The frets are thin and tall but with regard to fingerboards 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:46.730
 7.25 so-called vintage style 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.220
 The model of the so-called micro land which adopts the radials adopts this specification 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.340
 I'm sorry but when I called grip 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.690
 Play in the high potion when you go to the high fret in the preview 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.620
 If there is a place where flat one is easier to pull in terms of ability 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 I think 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.480
 Obtained unless out Econo Radius of the so-called 7.25 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.930
 I keep about 7.25 for this guitar because there is no such feeling 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.540
 While 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:16.860
 And with regard to the frets, the 60,000 yen round bar of 61 people with fifty dunners that is a little thin and tall 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:22.080
 By all means because it is the specs quite stuck to say that chose the fret 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:27.090
 Here is the point you want to check on the actual machine 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:31.540
 And of course it's a big bait error jet because of 66 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:36.510
 Of the so-called lacquer finish rather than Toka 68 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.510
 Gold of a traditional logo has been adopted 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:47.270
 And this tape is usually 68 to 69 specifications and of course f key 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:52.000
 It becomes, but about this age 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.000
 The so-called Cluson type is used 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.800
 The part that really affects the sound character even the material or spec of this peg 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.840
 I think so 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.280
 On this day Megumi with a village style body that comes to this 667 to Peghead 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.910
 By all means here that if 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.310
 I would like you to check it on a real machine 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:14.900
 And for the neck too , it 's not a so-called 6869 urethane 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.639
 Finished with a lacquer 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.300
 I think that it also affects three times because it also changes in the sense that also feel when holding 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.509
 I will 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.790
 And it got pretty stuffed about this guitar 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:31.310
 This maple neck is used 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:35.490
 The choice when it can be said that it is a master build is exactly 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:39.780
 Because We have also deepened the pole and friendship to enter the country 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:45.449
 It can be understood that they also see and listen to our face 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:50.900
 Extracting a cat that is packed with miso, it is said that this is a high ice tea agent 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.900
 It will be in the place where I would like you to come and check in the area because it can be seen that 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.160
 And of course 4 Hiro of this body bag 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:03.520
 It's blowing But around there is almost no exposed portion of the white 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.520
 I think that has been finished quite thin also seen where saying 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.430
 The so-called stratocaster instrument is really different depending on the model year 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:16.650
 Specs have been left and right 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:21.900
 Appendix will be born from those of 54 years style called foot body of maple while 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:26.289
 Or The Big saying Rose finger board is adopted in every finishes its year year 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.909
 Peg head is adopted and even various specs are really 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:34.569
 A wide variety of characters in the three-part character is adopted by being adopted 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:37.569
 Spec that has been incorporated is already the Stratocaster 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:42.789
 I think just or not it can be said that one of the taste Daigo 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:46.280
 Not in the so-called vintage Among them by the fact that this time the 66 spec in the 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:51.620
 The so-called 3d character pretty master when saying play billi 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.840
 Also because it models a real time setting of the build unique to Tteyuu sound to what is obtained 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.790
 Of course I think there are 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:03.650
 The sub-characters that can be obtained now because it is an instrument finished by the master builder 

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:06.270
 Now that's why Fender 's tone is tightly contained in this 

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:10.080
 I think that there is, so this commitment 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.210
 Unleashed 66-style Stratocaster at Guitars Station 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.200
 I would like to check it out 

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.200
 It was Guitars station
