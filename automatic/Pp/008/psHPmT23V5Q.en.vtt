00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.590 
not usable here's the tilt so modeled
very<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:04.549> I've<00:01:05.549> seen<00:01:05.760> better<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.150> course<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
very well I've seen better of course but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
very well I've seen better of course but
that's<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.930> expensive<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that's more expensive this was like a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.500 
that's more expensive this was like a
hundred<00:01:08.340> bucks<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.080> there's<00:01:10.080> issues<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
hundred bucks so there's issues with it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.510 
hundred bucks so there's issues with it
like<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.100> blade<00:01:14.240> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.299> wobbles<00:01:16.520> inside
