 be sure to get up yourself 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.219
 pharmacy carries 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.130
 so the very first thing i will do i 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.650
 I'll hide the flaws on my skin 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.780
 for this I will use the pet of winter 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.600
 and autumn this is the foundation from gerlen 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 It nourishes perfectly moisturizes the skin but when 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.830
 this does not slip even on my 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.650
 oily skin lasts almost all 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.780
 day for a redness label i have 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.869
 ip66 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 she is very good concealer and with 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.190
 this shading the edges so 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.300
 hardly noticed you somewhere 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.130
 there for not hiding some pimple want 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.320
 note that for your wrong on 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.690
 a cop I choose a one-tone concert 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.610
 lighter foundation and this thing for 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.810
 to make it look as good as possible 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 naturally and god hide my seeds all 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 brushes and the name of all the products i like 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.619
 always leave in infobox so not 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.009
 overload you with extra information but 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 This brush is also from the set for 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.990
 concealer feathering and she is pretty 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.020
 bad works 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 but 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.330
 in the last video you praised the blush 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.760
 such exactly that way I him 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.060
 I achieve I mix blush in biysk with 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.060
 bronzer 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.310
 Well, finally I had a palette 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.380
 naked 2 is not that it is new 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.380
 honestly to this i was pretty 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.180
 I like her shades for a long time I think 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:28.450
 what for everyday make-up is 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:30.760
 ideally this is the truth say that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.680
 eyebrows make out a face i don't know so i 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.780
 I make my eyebrows so any 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.120
 makeup option I try and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.040
 emphasize even a little bit but even 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.830
 for neutral makeup they will 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.630
 serve as a powerful argument to make your 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.240
 face brighter striking but 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.170
 try also not to overdo it a little bit 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.170
 shadow and gel 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.340
 Well, finally turn an eye for 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.800
 start i'll use this one 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.660
 brush it from the shading kit 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.300
 shadows you too seymour 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.430
 and she's great typing they also in 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.890
 rest their centuries while they are not 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.470
 shoveling cartridge that shade texture 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.720
 urban dickey and pretty loose but 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:32.890
 With this pussy they are perfectly applied and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:35.770
 stick as you see for natural 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.660
 make-up i use light golden 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.150
 hue that I put on everything moving 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.270
 eyelid and also with the help of light matte 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.590
 the shadows brighten the area under the brow and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.590
 inner corners of the eyes 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.700
 but now is the time to put accents in 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.769
 our makeup for this i will use 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.860
 a darker shade of shadow 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.829
 it is literally 3 tones darker 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.930
 golden color I wear it on the outside 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:11.890
 corner of the eye and while neatly under 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.859
 gone and I want to make makeup light 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.289
 weightlessness so today i 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.539
 I refuse shooters liners and other 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.720
 weighting components for any 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.970
 makeup I just let you down a little 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.400
 corner of the outer eye with the same 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.800
 shadows that we have made in the fold is 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.310
 dark brown color Misha and Vaseline 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.320
 stam shades and at the same time here I will 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.070
 work through the contour of the century and gently 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.070
 shade 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.510
 Well, of course, in the morning I have a very 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.820
 rumpled view so I just extremely 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.440
 need to use beige 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.660
 pencil on the water line in order 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.300
 to open your eye and make it 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.530
 more fresh and expressive and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.530
 make me sick 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.089
 Next I put the base under the mascara also 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.580
 apply mascara and divide the cilia at 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.740

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.430
 the fact that the base under the ink and mixed not 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 necessarily 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.550
 usually for such a neutral 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.229
 subordinate makeup i love 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.150
