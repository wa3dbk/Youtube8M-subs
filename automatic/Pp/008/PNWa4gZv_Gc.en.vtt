00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 but what yes 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:19.810
 to the same 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750
 I have to tell jackson not to 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.110
 we can continue to see each other quickly and without 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.170
 dollar very much look at jackson is so 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.140
 monkey today maybe I should leave it with 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.930
 nike to marry me super hot with her 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.089
 you work stop throwing spent on the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.909
 screw hole and well I have decided 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.659
 do not make me understand you and six lists 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:53.370
 good 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.370
 it does not help me 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.420
 I just need a moment to think 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420
 alone 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 or the one that I can not talk about now 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 force to seek God to tell him that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.230
 if I won that if I finish conchshells I think 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 I believe god I do not want you searched for all 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.220
 parts how dare you dethrone me 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.540
 well and with operetta nothing less and let me 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 I explain to you there is nothing to explain 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.750
 you've already decided on one and I'm going to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.490
 add for the most overturn I think you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 wrong if you listen to me a second 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.979
 I had talk pretty badly spent and my 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.509
 valuable time with you if you want that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.050
 something is done well you look at opening with 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.050
 singer 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.950
 a song about me if that's what 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.370
 I 've always wanted to tell you but never 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.130
 you know how you made me whether good 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.430
 with the help of operetta I had never been 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.149
 said something so beautiful this is what 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.660
 you were doing surprise together and not 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.620
 I know how I could doubt you if I 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.650
 I apologized I would ask you now 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.120
 same accepted 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.709
 You should sing my song at the meeting 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.450
 of monster students of Friday of all 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.880
 and everyone would listen to you and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 naturally I would not look pharaonic 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.270
 person or not I do not sing live never 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.000
 my voice affects people a lot more 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.770
 sure to hear the recorded I have to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.320
 to put this song to my friends 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.000
 they're going to die too, it's just that it's not 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.610
 I think that I do not understand it myself 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 so you like the two 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.920
 but what has given me the best 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.170
 boyfriend of the world 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.510
 and how can we like two and a half 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.610
 I liked you but you gave me a sit-down 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.970
 So many times that son was always there 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.970
 yes we are two opposite poles music 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.270
 if you are looking at all of them at a moment 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.270
 it's going to be me 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.230
 stand out
