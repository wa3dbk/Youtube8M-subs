00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
faster than the last level but do not

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.370 
faster than the last level but do not
really<00:02:57.670> know<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.660> were<00:02:58.780> doing<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.230> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
hall with some rooms in the middle you

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.289 
hall with some rooms in the middle you
can<00:03:23.799> kind<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.010> go<00:03:24.130> around<00:03:24.250> how<00:03:24.910> hard<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.239> have
