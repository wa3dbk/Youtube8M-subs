00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
like to have the same design as me then

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.810 
like to have the same design as me then
I'll<00:00:37.559> link<00:00:37.739> them<00:00:37.920> down<00:00:38.040> below<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.430> without

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
I'll link them down below and without

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
I'll link them down below and without
further<00:00:39.030> ado<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.750> hop<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
further ado let's actually hop into this

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
further ado let's actually hop into this
video<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.219> here's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> first<00:00:41.969> design<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
video so here's the first design and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.569 
video so here's the first design and
it's<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.170> favorite<00:00:43.829> ones<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it's one of my favorite ones all you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's one of my favorite ones all you
will<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.090> said<00:00:45.300> before<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> plastic

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
will need as I said before is a plastic

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.240 
will need as I said before is a plastic
clear<00:00:46.620> case<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> design<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> use

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
clear case and a design you want to use

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
clear case and a design you want to use
the<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:50.550> using<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> house<00:00:51.480> flying

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the one I'm using is this house flying

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.420 
the one I'm using is this house flying
with<00:00:52.079> balloons<00:00:52.410> from<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> movie<00:00:52.980> called<00:00:53.190> up

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
with balloons from the movie called up

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
with balloons from the movie called up
and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.030> first<00:00:54.180> thing<00:00:54.329> I'm<00:00:54.570> doing<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and the first thing I'm doing is just

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
and the first thing I'm doing is just
measuring<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> exact<00:00:55.980> size<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> case<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
measuring the exact size of the case so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.840 
measuring the exact size of the case so
I<00:00:57.000> could<00:00:57.180> cut<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.390> precisely<00:01:01.579> once<00:01:02.579> that's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I could cut it precisely once that's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.700 
I could cut it precisely once that's
done<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.570> put<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> inside<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.229> case<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
done I just put it inside the case and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
done I just put it inside the case and
also<00:01:04.860> cut<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> part<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> camera<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
also cut the part for the camera and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
also cut the part for the camera and
that's<00:01:07.200> pretty<00:01:07.409> much<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.950> next<00:01:11.159> design

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that's pretty much it this next design

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.130 
that's pretty much it this next design
is<00:01:11.610> quite<00:01:11.850> different<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.110> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
is quite different and for this one you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
is quite different and for this one you
will<00:01:13.350> need<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> clear<00:01:13.740> plastic<00:01:14.010> case<00:01:14.369> again

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
will need a clear plastic case again

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
will need a clear plastic case again
some<00:01:15.180> washi<00:01:15.390> tape<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> design<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> want

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
some washi tape and the design you want

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.969 
some washi tape and the design you want
to<00:01:16.860> use

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.219 

I<00:01:25.729> chose<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> pink<00:01:27.030> washi<00:01:27.210> tape<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.840> stick<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I chose the pink washi tape and stick to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.139 
I chose the pink washi tape and stick to
the<00:01:28.469> case<00:01:28.679> until<00:01:29.039> it<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.429> covered<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
the case until it was all covered and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.880 
the case until it was all covered and
I'll<00:01:30.570> cut<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> design<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> wanted<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.679> use

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I'll cut the design I wanted to use

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.789 
I'll cut the design I wanted to use
which<00:01:32.130> says<00:01:32.369> me<00:01:32.640> plus<00:01:32.969> Wi-Fi<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.590> stick

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
which says me plus Wi-Fi and then stick

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.130 
which says me plus Wi-Fi and then stick
it<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.069> top<00:01:38.369> using<00:01:38.700> normal<00:01:39.119> tape<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.929> case

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it on top using normal tape and the case

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.669 
it on top using normal tape and the case
is<00:01:40.350> done<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:44.659> really<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.020> case<00:01:46.289> as<00:01:46.500> well

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
is done I really like this case as well

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.410 
is done I really like this case as well
it<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.159> describes<00:01:47.399> me<00:01:47.819> because<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.210> can

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it really describes me because I can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.059 
it really describes me because I can
survive<00:01:48.719> without<00:01:48.899> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.500> at<00:01:49.560> all<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.920> this

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
survive without Wi-Fi at all and this

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.859 
survive without Wi-Fi at all and this
next<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.429> is<00:01:53.549> inspired<00:01:54.030> by<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.360> quote<00:01:54.659> from

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
next one is inspired by the quote from

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
next one is inspired by the quote from
the<00:01:54.990> movie<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> book<00:01:55.560> called<00:01:55.920> The<00:01:56.069> Fault<00:01:56.250> in

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the movie and book called The Fault in

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:06.949 
the movie and book called The Fault in
Our<00:01:56.459> Stars<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:57.240> says<00:01:57.509> okay<00:01:57.899> okay<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.750> did

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
Our Stars which says okay okay so I did

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.419 
Our Stars which says okay okay so I did
the<00:02:07.079> same<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.319> as<00:02:07.709> I<00:02:07.799> did<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.190> first

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
the same thing as I did with the first

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
the same thing as I did with the first
case<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.119> found<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> design<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.319> printed

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
case I just found the design and printed

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
case I just found the design and printed
it<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.799> on<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> normal<00:02:11.220> paper<00:02:11.579> and<00:02:12.000> then<00:02:12.090> cut<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it out on a normal paper and then cut it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:21.160 
it out on a normal paper and then cut it
out<00:02:12.510> according<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.200> size<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> case

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.720 

so<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:22.410> how<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.650> finally<00:02:22.800> turned<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so that's how it finally turned out and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.250 
so that's how it finally turned out and
I<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.180> they<00:02:24.270> even<00:02:24.300> sell<00:02:24.750> these<00:02:24.960> kind<00:02:25.200> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I think they even sell these kind of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.230 
I think they even sell these kind of
cases<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.770> stores<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.610> why<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.000> need<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
cases at stores but why do you need to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.820 
cases at stores but why do you need to
buy<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.960> make<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> yourself<00:02:28.380> this

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
buy it if you can make it yourself this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.320 
buy it if you can make it yourself this
next<00:02:29.130> design<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.550> will<00:02:29.670> pretty<00:02:29.850> much<00:02:30.060> need

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
next design you will pretty much need

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.150 
next design you will pretty much need
the<00:02:30.450> same<00:02:30.660> things<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:31.050> before<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:31.920> time

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the same things as before but this time

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:43.610 
the same things as before but this time
I<00:02:32.220> decided<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.760> use<00:02:32.940> Donuts<00:02:42.020> so<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.290> cut<00:02:43.530> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
I decided to use Donuts so I just cut it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.620 
I decided to use Donuts so I just cut it
out<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.010> stick<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:44.580> into<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> case<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
out and stick it right into the case and

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.140 
out and stick it right into the case and
also<00:02:46.050> cut<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> camera<00:02:46.920> part<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.490> this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
also cut out the camera part and this

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.730 
also cut out the camera part and this
case<00:02:48.450> somehow<00:02:48.720> makes<00:02:49.140> me<00:02:49.320> really<00:02:49.590> hungry

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
case somehow makes me really hungry

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:00.070 
case somehow makes me really hungry
because<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.520> donuts<00:02:50.880> look<00:02:51.060> really<00:02:51.360> good

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.479
