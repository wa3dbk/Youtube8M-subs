00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.210
 spirit that is within him craves 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.930
 the return is within this spirit 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.140
 his 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.440

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.140

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.800
 west the son of man coming with 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.270

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.920
 My heavenly god, take us out of this world.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.880
 incompatibility that is mortal 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.880
 being clothed with immortality 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.310
 because in fact we will not all sleep 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 but we will be transformed into an open 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.560
 and close your eyes at the last trumpet 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.570

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.590

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.500
 hallowed and then glorified them 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.750
 Maranata comes Lord Jesus that means 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.600
 not wanting to come back is because you 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.239

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.480

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.850
 does not have the spirit of God and the bride says 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.840
 they see the church can not stand it any more 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:35.810

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:39.200
