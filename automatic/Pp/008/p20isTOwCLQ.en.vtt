 President of the Russian freediving federation 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 Natalya Molchanova went missing 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 dive time in the Spanish water area 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.130
 formentera 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.980
 she plunged other athletes on 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.949
 a depth of 30 40 meters and at some point 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.359
 Gone is the version that took her 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.939
 a strong undercurrent about the dangers 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.920
 freediving talk on the phone with 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.099
 freediving Federation Instructor 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.109
 champion of Russia 14 years in diving 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.380
 fins depth master of sports 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.380
 underwater sports evgeny sychev 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.680
 hello hello to your 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.750
 look what could happen with natalie 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.719
 Well here we can only guess what could 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.690
 happen here either most likely 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 really weather never and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.090
 conditions such as strong view 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 undercurrents 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 which could carry away metal or curtains 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.010
 sailors either from how much did not dive 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.380
 and wins did not have to spend much 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.990
 more power to commit on 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.820
 rock step could different could happen in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 including 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 ordinary danger if an athlete we put 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.140
 a little bit does not count its strength it 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.350
 can lead to loss of consciousness precisely 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 so always 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 Athletes outfit must with experienced 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 insurer what case 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 problems can help many skip 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.439
 must necessarily be appropriate 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 qualifications such highlights 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 tell me she usually is not strong 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 sometimes undercurrents how to cope 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.439
 with them divers well , still need 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.210
 say that all training at 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.510
 novotny and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.370
 marks 2 cm and tries to hold such 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.580
 places where there are no undercurrents or not 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.630
 quite insignificantly and case 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.750
 really some kind of strong currents 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 just there are no training sessions and 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.470
 competition 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.650
 Here, but if this water area may not be 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.990
 does not entirely unfamiliar unexplored 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.610
 either some expired 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.980
 all of a sudden but then of course there is no longer a part 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.420
 you can not do 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 Eugene, how likely is that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.560
 during the dive the freediver will lose 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.120
 consciousness what security measures 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.070
 taken at such dives total 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.690
 so that droplets usually occur 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.420
 only to the surface when you are already after 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.830
 stand here the main thing is not to dive alone and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.850
 accordingly all competitions all 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.680
 training nike pass necessarily 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.510
 the insurer and experienced who 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.320
 control all have time 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.120
 and the ascent of the object is already on the surface 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.690
 almost always it has to say 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.600
 what always 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.010
 Inferno they have it enough 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.020
 athletes exactly when training 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.920
 or participating in competitions they 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.700
 always fastened with special cables 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.840
 sailors along which 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.130
 elegant case of some kind of problem 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.160
 an athlete can't get away from 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.870
 Tell this cable Evgeny about what 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.090
 maximum depth of immersion from 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.940
 breath hold how dangerous it is in 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.680
 principle for human health 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.020
 Well, it's all very train and that is 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.550
 an ordinary person in principle can up 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.490
 normal healthy person can dive 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.880
 where to put the week to a depth of order 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.220
 30 meters and whether competent will help 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.650
 training on if of course 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.430
 highly trained athletes now 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.700
 world record among men in their 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.440
 pins 128 meters in women lying on 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.610
 waist 101 meter in principle with the right 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.990
 approach with proper training is 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:09.200
 safe enough and very such 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.730
 I do not bear any consequences 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.530
 thank with us for direct communication in
