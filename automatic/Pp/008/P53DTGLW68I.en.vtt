00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
is wrong with them just by even looking

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.289 
is wrong with them just by even looking
at<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.769> expression<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.340> their<00:02:33.459> faces<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:34.120> on

at the expression on their faces off on
times<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.470> think<00:02:35.739> that's<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.220> unique

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
times and I think that's a unique
characteristic<00:02:37.870> about<00:02:38.500> us<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.400> fact<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.140> we

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
characteristic about us the fact that we

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.640 
characteristic about us the fact that we
have<00:02:41.680> an<00:02:42.129> excellent<00:02:42.730> program<00:02:43.109> but<00:02:44.109> we<00:02:44.290> don't

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
have an excellent program but we don't

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.819 
have an excellent program but we don't
allow<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.340> excellent<00:02:46.090> program<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:47.379> move<00:02:47.590> us

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
allow that excellent program to move us

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.430 
allow that excellent program to move us
from<00:02:48.250> what<00:02:48.700> its<00:02:48.849> most<00:02:49.090> important<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.900> thus

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
and cohesive look we were very conscious

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.670 
and cohesive look we were very conscious
about<00:03:08.440> creating<00:03:08.859> a<00:03:08.950> sense<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.340> place<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.440> it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
about creating a sense of place and it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.900 
about creating a sense of place and it
started<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.760> very<00:03:13.120> small<00:03:13.209> ways<00:03:14.910> edging

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
started in very small ways edging

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.900 
started in very small ways edging
sidewalks<00:03:17.669> discouraging<00:03:18.669> people<00:03:18.790> from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
sidewalks discouraging people from

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.869 
sidewalks discouraging people from
walking<00:03:19.299> on<00:03:19.419> the<00:03:19.510> grass<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.569> no<00:03:23.200> littering

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
walking on the grass and no littering

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.490 
walking on the grass and no littering
campaign<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.410> we<00:03:27.069> systematically

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
campaign and so we systematically

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.369 
campaign and so we systematically
started<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.680> raise<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:31.060> sights<00:03:31.379> because

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
started to raise the sights because

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.530 
started to raise the sights because
obviously<00:03:32.859> people<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.760> more<00:03:34.120> about<00:03:34.239> what

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
obviously people know more about what

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.949 
obviously people know more about what
they<00:03:34.690> see<00:03:34.750> them<00:03:35.109> what<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.379> tell<00:03:35.590> them<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
they see them what you tell them and

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.140 
they see them what you tell them and
then<00:03:38.169> once<00:03:38.379> we<00:03:38.560> started<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.069> campaign<00:03:39.489> for

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
then once we started the campaign for

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.990 
then once we started the campaign for
the<00:03:40.540> sense<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.900> place<00:03:41.310> we<00:03:42.310> even<00:03:42.519> went<00:03:42.790> back<00:03:42.849> and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
the sense of place we even went back and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.170 
the sense of place we even went back and
we<00:03:43.389> retro<00:03:43.900> buildings<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:45.400> had<00:03:45.639> had<00:03:45.879> flat

we retro buildings that had had flat

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.420 
we retro buildings that had had flat
tops<00:03:46.480> we<00:03:46.840> put<00:03:47.370> pitch<00:03:48.370> rules<00:03:48.669> on<00:03:48.940> them<00:03:50.400> again<00:03:51.400> a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
tops we put pitch rules on them again a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.559 
tops we put pitch rules on them again a
very<00:03:51.699> conscious<00:03:52.620> plan<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.940> give<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> sense<00:03:55.480> of

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
very conscious plan to give a sense of

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.770 
very conscious plan to give a sense of
wholeness<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:57.010> campus<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.940> certainly

wholeness to the campus and certainly

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.680 
wholeness to the campus and certainly

we<00:06:14.870> set<00:06:15.080> out<00:06:15.200> to<00:06:15.380> do<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:17.650> every<00:06:18.650> other<00:06:18.950> day<00:06:19.400> I

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
we set out to do and every other day I

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.400 
we set out to do and every other day I
have<00:06:19.820> a<00:06:19.850> bit<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.180> gratification<00:06:21.110> that<00:06:21.200> we<00:06:21.320> were

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
have a bit of gratification that we were

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.560 
have a bit of gratification that we were
doing<00:06:21.680> just<00:06:21.890> that<00:06:22.160> we<00:06:23.030> have<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.180> highly

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
doing just that we have a highly

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.810 
doing just that we have a highly
credentialed<00:06:23.840> faculty<00:06:24.680> we<00:06:25.430> have<00:06:25.550> fine

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
credentialed faculty we have fine

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.750

facilities first-rate technology and

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.120 
facilities first-rate technology and
again<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.990> majority<00:06:33.440> of<00:06:33.500> students<00:06:33.830> who<00:06:33.920> come

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
again the majority of students who come

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.830 
again the majority of students who come
here<00:06:34.190> would<00:06:34.700> not<00:06:34.850> have<00:06:35.000> experienced<00:06:35.660> anything

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
here would not have experienced anything

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.980 
here would not have experienced anything
quite<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:36.350> what<00:06:36.740> they<00:06:36.830> find<00:06:36.860> here<00:06:37.990> where

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
quite like what they find here where

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.060 
quite like what they find here where
they<00:06:39.110> live<00:06:39.380> and<00:06:39.880> so<00:06:40.880> I<00:06:40.910> think<00:06:42.940> that<00:06:44.530> in<00:06:45.530> the

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
they live and so I think that in the

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.060 
they live and so I think that in the
future<00:06:46.340> there<00:06:47.030> will<00:06:47.240> be<00:06:47.390> young<00:06:47.750> people<00:06:48.140> who

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
future there will be young people who

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.820 
future there will be young people who
had<00:06:49.310> distilled<00:06:49.760> experience<00:06:50.470> who<00:06:51.470> will<00:06:51.620> make<00:06:51.800> a

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
had distilled experience who will make a

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.100 
had distilled experience who will make a
real<00:06:52.130> difference<00:06:52.540> not<00:06:53.540> only<00:06:53.600> in<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:53.930> world

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
real difference not only in the world

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.210 
real difference not only in the world
but<00:06:54.500> specifically<00:06:55.220> for<00:06:55.310> people<00:06:55.760> who<00:06:55.850> are<00:06:55.940> poor
