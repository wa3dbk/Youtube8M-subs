be comparing this to my old macbook I
had<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> two<00:02:25.280> gigahertz<00:02:25.579> intel<00:02:26.299> core<00:02:26.540> 2<00:02:26.780> duo

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
had a two gigahertz intel core 2 duo

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.740 
had a two gigahertz intel core 2 duo
processor<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:28.040> 2<00:02:28.340> gigabytes<00:02:28.819> Aram<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.629> was

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
processor and 2 gigabytes Aram it was

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.830 
processor and 2 gigabytes Aram it was
the<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:29.930> macbook<00:02:30.640> startup<00:02:31.640> times<00:02:31.909> is<00:02:32.299> about

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the way macbook startup times is about

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.080 
the way macbook startup times is about
the<00:02:32.989> same<00:02:33.140> with<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.439> macbook<00:02:33.829> pro<00:02:34.069> but<00:02:34.939> they

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the same with the macbook pro but they

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.530 
the same with the macbook pro but they
were<00:02:35.269> both<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.220> fluctuates<00:02:37.790> 20<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.299> 30

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
were both it really fluctuates 20 to 30

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.679 
were both it really fluctuates 20 to 30
seconds<00:02:39.019> I<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.470> tested<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:40.040> pro<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:41.569> was

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
seconds I just tested my pro and it was

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.140 
seconds I just tested my pro and it was
31<00:02:42.170> seconds<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.310> not<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> difference<00:02:43.969> at<00:02:44.120> all

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
31 seconds so not a difference at all

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.429 
31 seconds so not a difference at all
with<00:02:45.049> my<00:02:45.260> old<00:02:45.439> notebook<00:02:46.540> shut<00:02:47.540> down<00:02:47.720> Times<00:02:47.930> my

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
with my old notebook shut down Times my

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.789 
with my old notebook shut down Times my
macbook<00:02:49.159> was<00:02:49.790> about<00:02:50.060> four<00:02:50.329> seconds<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.620> shut

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
macbook was about four seconds to shut

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.399 
macbook was about four seconds to shut
down<00:02:51.859> and<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.900> pro<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.590> 1<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.939> 1.5<00:02:56.200> seconds<00:02:57.200> so

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
down and this pro is 1 to 1.5 seconds so

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.770 
down and this pro is 1 to 1.5 seconds so
it's<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.769> pretty<00:02:57.889> good<00:02:58.189> difference<00:02:58.629> next<00:02:59.629> thing

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
it's a pretty good difference next thing

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.979 
it's a pretty good difference next thing

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.310 
that come with the mini DisplayPort
should<00:06:41.410> also<00:06:41.560> come<00:06:41.949> with<00:06:41.979> the<00:06:42.220> DVI<00:06:42.580> adapter

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
should also come with the DVI adapter

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.930 
should also come with the DVI adapter
the<00:06:44.320> reason<00:06:44.680> for<00:06:44.889> that<00:06:44.919> is<00:06:45.190> because<00:06:45.220> we<00:06:45.760> all

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
the reason for that is because we all

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.820 
the reason for that is because we all
have<00:06:46.180> external<00:06:46.510> monitors<00:06:47.080> that<00:06:47.320> we<00:06:47.470> like<00:06:47.650> to

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
have external monitors that we like to

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.100 
have external monitors that we like to
use<00:06:48.039> well<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:48.970> hope<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.389> enjoyed<00:06:49.750> this<00:06:49.900> review
