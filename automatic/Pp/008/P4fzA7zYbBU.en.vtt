hey<00:00:05.879> guys<00:00:06.089> cool<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.600> 360<00:00:07.200> from<00:00:07.410> gamers<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.890> B&amp;J

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
hey guys cool do 360 from gamers to B&amp;J

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.310 
hey guys cool do 360 from gamers to B&amp;J
here<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.940> today<00:00:09.059> i<00:00:09.240> came<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> new

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
here and today i came up with a new

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.459 
here and today i came up with a new
design<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.219> hidden<00:00:11.519> door<00:00:11.730> just<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
design of a hidden door just with the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.830 
design of a hidden door just with the
usages<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.269> new<00:00:15.590> redstone<00:00:16.590> stuff<00:00:17.840> now

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
usages of the new redstone stuff now

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.630 
usages of the new redstone stuff now
this<00:00:19.050> isn't<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.500> complicated<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.279> fact<00:00:20.460> it's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
this isn't very complicated in fact it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.939 
this isn't very complicated in fact it's
very<00:00:21.180> easy<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.600> build<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.080> only<00:00:22.230> requires<00:00:22.500> like

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
very easy to build it only requires like

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.060 
very easy to build it only requires like
four<00:00:23.430> bits<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> redstone<00:00:24.289> I'm<00:00:25.289> including<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
four bits of redstone I'm including the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.790 
four bits of redstone I'm including the
collecting<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.210> ah<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> my<00:00:30.750> design<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
collecting of it ah this my design this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
collecting of it ah this my design this
design<00:00:32.369> does<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> disadvantage

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
design does have a bit of disadvantage

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
design does have a bit of disadvantage
for<00:00:34.110> example<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> need<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> sprint<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> class

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
for example I need to sprint the class

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.020 
for example I need to sprint the class
or<00:00:35.790> else<00:00:35.910> will<00:00:36.270> happen<00:00:37.489> or<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.820> need<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
or else will happen or I just need to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.220 
or else will happen or I just need to
get<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.390> close<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.520> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.899> can<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.110> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
get very close to it but I can make it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.930 
get very close to it but I can make it
more<00:00:43.320> compact<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.579> move<00:00:44.730> these

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
more compact if I just move these

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
more compact if I just move these
clothes<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> bit<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> design<00:00:48.200> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
clothes a bit so this is the design it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
clothes a bit so this is the design it
uses<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.739> type<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> glitch<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
uses a type of glitch with the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000 
uses a type of glitch with the
comparators<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.590> sure<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
comparators I'm not sure if it's a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.049 
comparators I'm not sure if it's a
glitch<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:54.110> intended<00:00:55.110> feature<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
glitch or a intended feature but as you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.310 
glitch or a intended feature but as you
can<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.859> this<00:00:58.859> button<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.899> passing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
can see this button is actually passing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
can see this button is actually passing
current<00:01:01.620> through<00:01:01.920> glass<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.520> doesn't<00:01:03.059> work

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
current through glass which doesn't work

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.350 
current through glass which doesn't work
so<00:01:03.989> its<00:01:04.140> diagonal<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.549> piston<00:01:06.240> which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so its diagonal to the piston which

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
so its diagonal to the piston which
normally<00:01:06.780> doesn't<00:01:06.930> work<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.610> some

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
normally doesn't work but for some

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
normally doesn't work but for some
reason<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.750> comparator<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
reason if I have this comparator here it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.929 
reason if I have this comparator here it
does<00:01:11.070> work<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> i'll<00:01:12.540> show<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.869> again<00:01:12.930> if

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
does work so i'll show you that again if

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.920 
does work so i'll show you that again if
i<00:01:14.939> remove<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> comparator<00:01:18.950> nothing<00:01:19.950> happens

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
i remove the comparator nothing happens

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
i remove the comparator nothing happens
so<00:01:21.930> let's<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.650> building<00:01:22.860> i'm<00:01:23.360> going<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> build

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so let's get building i'm going to build

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.569 
so let's get building i'm going to build
a<00:01:24.930> even<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.409> compact<00:01:25.770> version<00:01:25.979> over<00:01:26.340> here

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.819 

first<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.790> build<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.479> wall<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> has

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
first of all just build a wall that has

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.780 
first of all just build a wall that has
a<00:01:31.860> bend<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> i'm<00:01:34.020> gonna<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.790> like

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
a bend in it now i'm gonna do a like

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
a bend in it now i'm gonna do a like
four<00:01:36.390> by<00:01:36.509> three<00:01:36.540> i<00:01:38.240> haven't<00:01:39.240> played<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.200> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
four by three i haven't played with this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.880 
four by three i haven't played with this
i<00:01:41.240> haven't<00:01:42.240> played<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.659> enough<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.530> figure

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
i haven't played this enough to figure

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.710 
i haven't played this enough to figure
out<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:45.200> minimum<00:01:46.200> space<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.720> got

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
out the minimum space for it but I got

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
out the minimum space for it but I got
the<00:01:48.840> gist<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.329> few

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the gist of it so I'm not gonna few

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.170 
the gist of it so I'm not gonna few
blocks<00:01:52.670> do<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:54.110> design<00:01:55.110> stuff<00:01:55.500> whoops<00:01:56.399> my

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
blocks do your design stuff whoops my

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.679 
blocks do your design stuff whoops my
bad<00:01:58.670> there<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.119> should<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.540> if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bad there we go you should I know if

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.819 
bad there we go you should I know if
something<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.020> looks<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
something that looks like this in the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.899 
something that looks like this in the
beginning<00:02:02.329> 24<00:02:03.680> for<00:02:04.680> glock<00:02:04.920> wall<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> three

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
beginning 24 for glock wall with a three

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.670 
beginning 24 for glock wall with a three
block<00:02:06.090> wall<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.079> small<00:02:07.320> space<00:02:07.560> with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
block wall here and a small space with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.340 
block wall here and a small space with
two<00:02:07.890> sticky<00:02:08.220> pistons<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> middle<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
two sticky pistons in the middle and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.810 
two sticky pistons in the middle and
a to<00:02:10.950> buy<00:02:11.100> one<00:02:11.280> hallway<00:02:11.570> with<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> piston<00:02:13.820> the

a to buy one hallway with a piston the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.730 
a to buy one hallway with a piston the
behind<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.210> button<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.630> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> add<00:02:16.050> glass

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
behind the button you want to add glass

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340 
behind the button you want to add glass
and<00:02:17.070> then<00:02:17.520> dig<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.060> small<00:02:18.120> hole<00:02:18.570> around<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
and then dig a small hole around the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.710 
and then dig a small hole around the
edge<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:20.010> area<00:02:20.600> not<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:22.700> put<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.850> sticky

edge of this area not that put a sticky

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.290 
edge of this area not that put a sticky
piston<00:02:24.900> right<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:28.010> put<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> redstone<00:02:29.580> block

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
piston right here put a redstone block

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.570 
piston right here put a redstone block
there<00:02:30.780> put<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> comparator<00:02:32.040> facing<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.520> way

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
there put a comparator facing that way

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.070 
there put a comparator facing that way
and<00:02:33.860> you're<00:02:34.860> pretty<00:02:35.130> much<00:02:35.280> good<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:36.180> but

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
and you're pretty much good to go but

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
and you're pretty much good to go but
torch<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.830> put<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> block<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:39.150> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
torch here put a block here put a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.740 
torch here put a block here put a
redstone<00:02:39.450> up<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.490> move<00:02:41.490> all<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.970> stuff<00:02:42.000> I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
redstone up there move all the stuff I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.520 
redstone up there move all the stuff I
have<00:02:43.710> two<00:02:43.920> comparators<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.730> some<00:02:44.850> reason<00:02:45.530> but

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
have two comparators for some reason but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.190 
have two comparators for some reason but
this<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:47.030> actually<00:02:48.030> no<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.990> and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
this this actually no but this this and

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.740 
this this actually no but this this and
that<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.250> you're<00:02:50.640> pretty<00:02:50.850> much<00:02:51.000> done<00:02:53.750> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that and you're pretty much done and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.320 
that and you're pretty much done and
this<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.310> smaller<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.940> faster<00:02:57.540> go<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:59.330> it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this the smaller it is faster go so it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.240 
this the smaller it is faster go so it
really<00:03:00.510> depends<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> larger<00:03:02.040> wall

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
really depends if you have a larger wall

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.770 
really depends if you have a larger wall
will<00:03:02.430> take<00:03:02.610> longer<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> pass<00:03:03.300> through<00:03:03.540> I'm

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
will take longer to pass through I'm

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
will take longer to pass through I'm
guessing<00:03:04.680> because<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.820> put<00:03:05.970> your

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
guessing because you have to put your

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.170 
guessing because you have to put your
Peters<00:03:06.360> there<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:08.190> nonetheless<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.760> works

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
Peters there but nonetheless that works

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.400 
Peters there but nonetheless that works
and<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.930> remove<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.500> comparator<00:03:12.410> nothing

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
and if I remove the comparator nothing

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.210 
and if I remove the comparator nothing
happens<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.080> hope<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.590> guys<00:03:16.620> enjoy<00:03:17.100> this

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
happens so I hope you guys enjoy this

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
happens so I hope you guys enjoy this
video<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.790> hope<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.210> guys<00:03:18.390> enjoyed<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> tutorial

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
video I hope you guys enjoyed a tutorial

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.780 
video I hope you guys enjoyed a tutorial
and<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:20.040> found<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.880> easy<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.300> build<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:22.790> this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and you found it easy to build I this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.580 
and you found it easy to build I this
design<00:03:24.330> actually<00:03:24.660> requires<00:03:25.200> much<00:03:25.560> less

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
design actually requires much less

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.530 
design actually requires much less
redstone<00:03:26.310> than<00:03:26.460> before<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.390> are<00:03:27.510> many

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
redstone than before and there are many

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.950 
redstone than before and there are many
uses<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:28.020> comparator<00:03:28.680> with<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.340> glitch<00:03:29.960> I'm

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
uses for comparator with this glitch I'm

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.540 
uses for comparator with this glitch I'm
pretty<00:03:31.200> sure<00:03:31.350> mojang<00:03:31.830> will<00:03:31.980> actually<00:03:32.280> keep

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
pretty sure mojang will actually keep

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.240 
pretty sure mojang will actually keep
this<00:03:32.760> glitch<00:03:33.120> I'm<00:03:33.420> not<00:03:33.660> sure<00:03:33.720> though<00:03:34.250> but

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
this glitch I'm not sure though but

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:55.770 
this glitch I'm not sure though but
nonetheless<00:03:35.960> enjoy<00:03:36.960> your<00:03:37.140> day<00:03:37.290> bye

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780
