to<00:00:34.829> deal<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.270> real<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> deal

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
to deal with it and the real way to deal

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.389 
to deal with it and the real way to deal
with<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.800> better<00:00:38.010> than<00:00:38.190> him

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with it is to be just better than him

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.040 
with it is to be just better than him
with<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.790> Templar<00:00:39.180> control<00:00:39.510> versus<00:00:39.899> his

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with your Templar control versus his

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
with your Templar control versus his
ghost<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.340> walk<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
ghost and not just walk them all in and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
ghost and not just walk them all in and
attack<00:00:43.079> move<00:00:43.320> your<00:00:43.440> army<00:00:43.770> into<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> whole<00:00:44.850> bunch

of<00:00:45.120> EMPs<00:00:45.570> because<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.559> way

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of EMPs because that's a really good way

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.369 
of EMPs because that's a really good way
to<00:00:46.739> die<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to die so if that's what you do and you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
to die so if that's what you do and you
die<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.250> should<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.730> complaining

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
die you should not be complaining

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610 
die you should not be complaining
because<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:51.930> ways<00:00:52.110> around<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
because there are other ways around it

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
because there are other ways around it
and<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.789> video<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
gonna be like impossible to spot I'll

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
gonna be like impossible to spot I'll
even<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.320> go<00:01:40.439> around<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.189> I'm<00:01:41.549> sure<00:01:41.850> it's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
you're trying to weed out ghosts just

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.800 
you're trying to weed out ghosts just
throw<00:02:37.310> down<00:02:37.340> defensive<00:02:38.090> storms<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.630> if<00:02:38.690> they

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
throw down defensive storms so if they

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.910 
throw down defensive storms so if they
try<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.050> walk<00:02:39.290> through<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.650> they're<00:02:39.770> taking

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
try to walk through it they're taking

they<00:03:10.520> cannot<00:03:10.820> land<00:03:11.060> EMPs

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
they cannot land EMPs

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.600 
they cannot land EMPs
so<00:03:12.350> we're<00:03:12.440> gonna<00:03:12.530> see<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> Templar<00:03:13.130> moving<00:03:13.490> up

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
so we're gonna see the Templar moving up

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.870 
so we're gonna see the Templar moving up
here<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.930> as<00:03:15.320> we<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.650> select<00:03:16.520> does<00:03:16.700> have

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
here and as we can see select does have

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.640 
here and as we can see select does have
a<00:03:16.910> couple<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.270> ghosts<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:17.600> are<00:03:17.660> EMP<00:03:18.170> ready<00:03:18.440> so

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
a couple of ghosts that are EMP ready so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.650 
a couple of ghosts that are EMP ready so
it's<00:03:18.770> not<00:03:18.890> as<00:03:19.040> if<00:03:19.070> Huck<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.330> catching

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
it's not as if Huck is just catching

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.610 
it's not as if Huck is just catching
select<00:03:20.960> at<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.140> bad<00:03:21.290> time

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
select at a bad time

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.190 
select at a bad time
so<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.910> Templars<00:03:23.240> are<00:03:23.360> now<00:03:23.420> pressing<00:03:23.810> up<00:03:23.930> here

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
so the Templars are now pressing up here

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.290 
so the Templars are now pressing up here
he<00:03:24.620> has<00:03:24.770> spotting<00:03:25.250> because<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.790> observer

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
he has spotting because of this observer

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.270 
he has spotting because of this observer
so<00:03:26.930> he<00:03:27.080> knows<00:03:27.230> exactly<00:03:27.350> where<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.920> ghosts<00:03:28.190> are

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
so he knows exactly where the ghosts are

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.590 
so he knows exactly where the ghosts are
and<00:03:28.400> selects<00:03:28.640> gonna<00:03:28.850> try<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.150> stem<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.390> bunch

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
and selects gonna try and stem a bunch

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.840 
and selects gonna try and stem a bunch
of<00:03:29.690> units<00:03:29.960> to<00:03:30.080> kill<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:31.010> High<00:03:31.280> Templar<00:03:31.610> right

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
of units to kill this High Templar right

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.190 
of units to kill this High Templar right
here<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.270> he's<00:03:32.390> just<00:03:32.540> gonna<00:03:32.630> lay<00:03:32.810> down<00:03:32.840> another

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
here so he's just gonna lay down another

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.890 
here so he's just gonna lay down another
defensive<00:03:33.620> storm<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.160> am<00:03:34.940> right<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.390> if<00:03:35.810> he

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
defensive storm I am right there if he

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.330 
defensive storm I am right there if he
decides<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.410> run<00:03:36.620> through<00:03:36.800> any<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:37.160> he's

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
decides to run through any of this he's

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.280 
decides to run through any of this he's
just<00:03:37.520> gonna<00:03:37.670> take<00:03:37.880> free<00:03:38.180> damage<00:03:38.420> again<00:03:38.960> none

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
just gonna take free damage again none

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.810 
just gonna take free damage again none
of<00:03:39.410> your<00:03:39.500> units<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:39.950> taken<00:03:40.220> any<00:03:40.400> damage<00:03:40.670> so

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
of your units have taken any damage so

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240 
of your units have taken any damage so
far<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:41.960> you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.230> use<00:03:42.350> energy<00:03:42.590> for<00:03:42.980> damage

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
far so if you can use energy for damage

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.070 
far so if you can use energy for damage
on<00:03:43.370> these<00:03:43.460> units<00:03:43.640> that's<00:03:43.970> huge<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.540> if<00:03:44.990> you

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
on these units that's huge and if you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.870 
on these units that's huge and if you
can<00:03:45.230> feed<00:03:45.500> back<00:03:45.530> ghosts<00:03:46.190> which<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.520> able<00:03:46.760> to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
can feed back ghosts which is able to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880 
can feed back ghosts which is able to
right<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:47.450> because<00:03:47.780> select<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.290> simply<00:03:48.770> do

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890

one Templar around he could probably

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.750 
one Templar around he could probably
land<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.800> couple<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.100> feedbacks<00:04:16.460> on<00:04:16.640> these

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
land a couple of feedbacks on these

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.039 
land a couple of feedbacks on these
ghosts<00:04:17.060> before<00:04:17.359> they<00:04:17.450> had<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.600> chance<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.960> get

ghosts before they had a chance to get
any<00:04:18.140> MPs<00:04:18.560> off<00:04:18.710> so<00:04:19.010> more<00:04:19.820> battles<00:04:20.150> are<00:04:20.239> gonna

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
same thing with his ghost but Huck can

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.930 
same thing with his ghost but Huck can
actually<00:04:29.560> land<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.980> feedback<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.610> before

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
actually land a feedback on that before

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.940 
actually land a feedback on that before
the<00:04:31.510> ghost<00:04:31.750> can<00:04:31.960> if<00:04:32.140> he<00:04:32.230> reacts<00:04:32.560> well<00:04:32.770> enough

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
the ghost can if he reacts well enough

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040 
the ghost can if he reacts well enough
so<00:04:33.160> up<00:04:33.850> does<00:04:34.090> feedback<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.660> one<00:04:34.810> ghost

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
so up does feedback that one ghost

so up does feedback that one ghost

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
they want to keep attacking they can go

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.850 
they want to keep attacking they can go
ahead<00:05:01.570> but<00:05:01.840> they're<00:05:01.960> just<00:05:02.140> gonna<00:05:02.230> get<00:05:02.440> damages

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
ahead but they're just gonna get damages

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.130 
ahead but they're just gonna get damages
if<00:05:02.980> they<00:05:03.070> try<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.250> run<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.580> there<00:05:03.760> so<00:05:04.720> more

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
if they try to run up there so more

if they try to run up there so more
stories<00:05:05.470> are<00:05:05.560> going<00:05:05.650> down<00:05:05.920> Huck<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.280> actually

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
stories are going down Huck is actually

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.460 
stories are going down Huck is actually
really<00:05:06.760> whittling<00:05:07.150> down<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.480> army<00:05:07.750> as<00:05:07.900> we

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
really whittling down this army as we

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.650 
really whittling down this army as we
can<00:05:08.620> see<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.100> then<00:05:09.580> by<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.790> time<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.330> can<00:05:10.480> see

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
can see and then by the time you can see

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.360 
can see and then by the time you can see
his<00:05:10.930> armies<00:05:11.260> taken<00:05:11.590> almost<00:05:11.770> no<00:05:12.010> damage<00:05:12.190> there

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
his armies taken almost no damage there

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.620 
his armies taken almost no damage there
are<00:05:12.640> some<00:05:12.820> zealots<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.180> don't<00:05:13.360> have<00:05:13.480> any

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
are some zealots that don't have any

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.360 
are some zealots that don't have any
shields<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.170> it's<00:05:14.320> not<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.800> big<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:14.980> a<00:05:15.130> deal

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
shields but it's not that big of a deal

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.880 
shields but it's not that big of a deal
but<00:05:16.030> look<00:05:16.240> how<00:05:16.390> weak<00:05:16.750> SELEX<00:05:17.260> army<00:05:17.560> is<00:05:17.680> right

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
but look how weak SELEX army is right

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.160 
but look how weak SELEX army is right
now<00:05:18.010> so<00:05:18.220> select<00:05:18.550> tries<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.940> engage<00:05:19.060> Huck<00:05:19.990> could

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
now so select tries to engage Huck could

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.630 
now so select tries to engage Huck could
probably<00:05:20.350> just<00:05:20.590> attack<00:05:20.920> remove<00:05:21.220> and<00:05:21.400> roll

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
probably just attack remove and roll

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.120 
probably just attack remove and roll
that<00:05:21.820> over<00:05:22.030> so<00:05:22.510> we'll<00:05:23.260> see<00:05:23.410> exactly<00:05:23.680> what<00:05:23.980> does

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
that over so we'll see exactly what does

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.620 
that over so we'll see exactly what does
happen<00:05:24.580> these<00:05:24.730> Marauders<00:05:25.000> press<00:05:25.300> up<00:05:25.450> here

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
happen these Marauders press up here

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.600 
happen these Marauders press up here
again<00:05:25.810> another<00:05:26.560> defensive<00:05:27.010> storm<00:05:27.310> because

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
again another defensive storm because

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.280 
again another defensive storm because
Huck<00:05:27.790> is<00:05:27.910> not<00:05:28.120> totally<00:05:28.450> ready<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.780> engage<00:05:28.930> yet

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
Huck is not totally ready to engage yet

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.430 
Huck is not totally ready to engage yet
and<00:05:29.500> look<00:05:30.190> how<00:05:30.370> low<00:05:30.700> all<00:05:31.030> these<00:05:31.210> units<00:05:31.540> are<00:05:31.660> now

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
and look how low all these units are now

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.570 
and look how low all these units are now
this<00:05:32.590> is<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.770> point<00:05:32.980> where<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.250> can<00:05:33.400> start

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
this is a point where you can start

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.670 
this is a point where you can start
morphing<00:05:33.910> these<00:05:34.060> into<00:05:34.270> archons<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.900> possibly

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
morphing these into archons and possibly

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.230 
morphing these into archons and possibly
split<00:05:35.980> off<00:05:36.100> another<00:05:36.340> templar<00:05:36.760> or<00:05:36.850> two<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.120> try

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
split off another templar or two to try

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.210 
split off another templar or two to try
and<00:05:37.450> feed<00:05:37.600> back<00:05:37.630> these<00:05:37.990> ghosts<00:05:38.410> but<00:05:39.130> you're

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
and feed back these ghosts but you're

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.950 
and feed back these ghosts but you're
now<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:39.580> far<00:05:39.790> ahead<00:05:39.910> in<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.210> damage<00:05:40.600> battle

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
now so far ahead in the damage battle

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.780 
now so far ahead in the damage battle
that<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.590> doesn't<00:05:41.800> even<00:05:41.950> matter<00:05:42.100> if<00:05:42.220> he<00:05:42.430> has<00:05:42.550> go

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
that it doesn't even matter if he has go

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.250 
that it doesn't even matter if he has go
so<00:05:42.850> you<00:05:43.090> can<00:05:43.120> do<00:05:43.390> whatever<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:43.840> need<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
so you can do whatever you need to to

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260 
so you can do whatever you need to to
try<00:05:44.410> to<00:05:44.470> pick<00:05:44.680> these<00:05:44.830> off<00:05:45.040> if<00:05:45.370> you<00:05:45.940> have<00:05:46.060> blink

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
try to pick these off if you have blink

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.640 
try to pick these off if you have blink
stalkers<00:05:46.450> you<00:05:46.780> can<00:05:46.900> just<00:05:47.050> blink<00:05:47.260> them<00:05:47.380> forward

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
stalkers you can just blink them forward

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.290 
stalkers you can just blink them forward
by<00:05:47.710> themselves<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.400> try<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.640> focus<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:49.120> ghost

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
by themselves and try to focus the ghost

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.240 
by themselves and try to focus the ghost
down<00:05:49.510> there's<00:05:50.350> a<00:05:50.470> lot<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.830> different<00:05:51.070> stuff

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
down there's a lot of different stuff

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.820 
down there's a lot of different stuff
that<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.490> can<00:05:51.670> do<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.750> permit<00:05:53.350> yourself<00:05:53.470> with

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
that you can do to permit yourself with

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.430 
that you can do to permit yourself with
an<00:05:53.980> EMP<00:05:54.280> if<00:05:54.670> you<00:05:55.390> just<00:05:55.600> waltz<00:05:55.900> your<00:05:56.140> state

engagements<00:06:41.830> but<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:42.639> need<00:06:42.789> to<00:06:42.910> be<00:06:43.000> careful

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
engagements but you need to be careful

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.700 
engagements but you need to be careful
with<00:06:43.449> your<00:06:43.570> army<00:06:43.900> and<00:06:43.990> not<00:06:44.110> just<00:06:44.320> walk<00:06:44.530> in

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710

there and die

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.360 
there and die
so<00:06:46.000> use<00:06:46.300> your<00:06:46.330> Templar<00:06:46.870> lead<00:06:47.500> with<00:06:47.710> one<00:06:48.100> or<00:06:48.220> two

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
so use your Templar lead with one or two

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.740 
so use your Templar lead with one or two
of<00:06:48.490> them<00:06:48.639> make<00:06:49.030> sure<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.240> have<00:06:49.360> an<00:06:49.449> observer

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
of them make sure you have an observer

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.719 
of them make sure you have an observer
out<00:06:49.930> so<00:06:50.050> you<00:06:50.110> can<00:06:50.259> see<00:06:50.410> their<00:06:50.560> army<00:06:50.830> lead<00:06:51.580> with

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
out so you can see their army lead with

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.490 
out so you can see their army lead with
a<00:06:51.759> couple<00:06:52.090> of<00:06:52.150> Templar<00:06:52.509> try<00:06:52.720> to<00:06:52.780> land<00:06:52.990> storms

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
trial and feedbacks if you can spend the

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.469 
trial and feedbacks if you can spend the
Templars<00:06:56.470> energy<00:06:56.919> on<00:06:57.100> anything<00:06:57.880> instead<00:06:58.389> of
