00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 we present thermal cameras today 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 in the professional option to obtain 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.339
 your favorites in your own place of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.879
 work with the highest quality and form 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.879
 immediate 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.079
 the thermal cameras today or you 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.840
 allow to produce all kinds of photolites 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.720
 for serigraphy flexography or 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.269
 pad printing can produce a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.149
 color separation plot two inks 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.640
 flat or negative and all with one 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 machine with small dimensions 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 tight consumption and no maintenance 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.300
 the only consumable that he uses is field 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 no ink without toner and without any other 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.060
 chemical product therefore its consumption does not 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.850
 it is increased still making 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.930
 large black or negative masses 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.239
 the exclusive film of today reacts to the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.659
 micro thermal impulses that the camcorder 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.619
 applied very precisely forming a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.870
 black spot and very opaque to the rays 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.510
 ultraviolet 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.730
 the process is carried out dry by 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.730
 what does not need drying and can 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.550
 work immediately with him 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.280
 the film is very robust prepared for 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.220
 receive high temperatures without producing 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.500
 the slightest dilation 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.170
 [Music] 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.230
 all this means that the camcorders 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.340
 today they have a record accuracy 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.340
 black opacity and uniformity 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 excellent 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.850
 at the time of working with her the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.549
 camera is almost as 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.870
 Simple to operate like a printer 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.990
 standard injection or laser 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.950
 notwithstanding while of that ease of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.890
 use hides a powerful software the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.350
 riff to queens that manages all the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.330
 process from your design program 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.330
 to the camera or me 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.810
 this system also includes options 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.160
 advanced as the configuration of your 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.980
 frames choosing type of angle point or 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.410
 line as well as choosing between stretch 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.480
 ordered or stochastic 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.000
 You can also calibrate your curve 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.850
 gain save firm by joining 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 automatically all your designs 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.650
 get a detailed preview of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.490
 his drawings before being filmed between 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490
 many other options 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.100
 the range of camcorders today is very broad 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.200
 so there is a perfect machine for 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.810
 every need 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.430
 It has sizes ranging from 36 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.350
 up to 137 centimeters wide 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.560
 always with unlimited length 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:10.230
 You can also film frames of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.230
 more than 120 lines per inch 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.909
 with up to 1200 dots per inch of 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.579
 technology thermal technology much more 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:23.420
 effective than those of inkjet or 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:26.659
 laser and with a speed of up to 25 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.720
 centimeters per minute can reach 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.189
 high quality instantaneously for 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.189
 obtain photoliths in ceramic screen printing 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:40.770
 cardboard stamps rubber decals or 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:43.590
 packaging among many other industries 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.630
 I am the camera, they are the solution 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.030
 ideal for quality immediacy speed 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.590
 and ease of use to get your 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:00.339
 photonic 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.339
