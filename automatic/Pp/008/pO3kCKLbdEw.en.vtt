00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.960
 with did not say that money is not important and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 you can live without money but I'm on my own 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.000
 I know from experience that I live very well without money 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 very difficult and with little money 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 driving through is also very very difficult and 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.400

 even disdain but it is a symbol of even purity 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.069
