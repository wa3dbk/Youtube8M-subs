00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 that is the inner life of an amigos 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 hello my name is tom and me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020
 program a game but today would like 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.449
 I take you to the world of real things 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.750
 kidnap no i love truth 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.400
 purity and virtue no today 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.160
 I show you how such a level 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 can actually work like you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 Maybe I'll have one like this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 Body nico to the very end 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.870
 disassembled 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 the very disturbing video you can 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 Check it out again and find out 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.559
 this small fat was promoted that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.039
 is a nfc day and on this little one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.590
 nfc tag are all the data included 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.890
 from your chunky little plastic 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 kirby a real in-game kirby 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 make a fight machine and how such a nfc 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 actually day with your 3gs or 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 your view works we look 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 now time to read the nfc often let synonymous 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.710
 rfid 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.619
 but what does that mean anyway 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 radio frequency identification so 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.540
 any identification with 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 Radiowaves NFC means near field 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.880
 communication so a connection one 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.939
 communication over a short distance 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:42.780
 at nfc the maximum is 10 cm nfc and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:46.610
 rwe are, so to speak, based without nfc 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.200
 nfc is one of them, so to speak 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 Special form of a specialization of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.780
 heidi and indeed there are certain 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.270
 standardized that means how far the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.320
 distances and which ones 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.380
 Radio frequencies are even at the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.390
 nfc uses such a nfc day in one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
 amigo is a so-called 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.060
 passive tech that means he has none 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.360
 own power supply 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.010
 However, the years are to say 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.900
 Metal drones and chips as and data 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.599
 and so and there must be somewhere 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.230
 pure power and there is a real 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.920
 abysmal physical principle of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.340
 Electromagnetism 1 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.200
 Induction Induction you know 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.959
 maybe from the physics class 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.430
 some experiments you take role 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.349
 klopapier and wraps a lot there 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.610
 copper wire around it and then you take 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.340
 a rod magnets and copper wire start 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.180
 magnet and by moving back and forth 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.790
 of the magnet and thereby that is one 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920
 is the magnetic field around it 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.709
 this magnet induces by means of the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.840
 a current in the sink and 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 This stream can be measured there and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.420
 that's exactly how it works 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.630
 our nfc day here you see flat 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 a spool on the sticker glued something 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.319
 of course that is still missing now 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.680
 Magnetic field and that comes on his 3ds 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.070
 or your youth gamepad but that will 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.840
 not created now by being a strong one 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.100
 magnet for gays is hunted but 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 you can imagine that as in 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.530
 an electromagnetic that means that 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.120
 Magnetic field is generated with electricity and so on 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 It turns into a magnetic field 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.650
 built this in dependence of his 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.350
 of course, strengthen one particular 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.730
 reach possesses in the nfc of course 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.739
 maximum 10 cm 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.440
 because the amigos and the 3ds are like that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.750
 that you really really blatantly right on it 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.329
 must lay and then he will recognize what 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.459
 now happens exactly inside the ticker 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.829
 is different from the farmer to the type of construction 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.079
 usually, however, will be a blog 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.600
 data is read out and sent to the receiver 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.459
 in that case, that's what you are 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.130
 probably fight values ​​statistics 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.530
 and the like and then arises through 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.480
 the induction is a current flow and it 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.340
 data can be read out 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.889
 how does it work internally exactly 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.660
 is partly from farmer to farmer 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.110
 different, however, this data 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.600
 then be with 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.030
 the waves are sent to the receiver and 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.250
 that can then be encrypted as it 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.150
 are decrypting and interpreting 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.549
 the special thing about the amigo nfc day is that 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.350
 yes also describable that is it 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.150
 are synonymous which one can only one 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.130
 For example, if you read somewhere 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.620
 puts down his cell phone and says when you open 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.600
 That day I'm going in 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.430
 plane google just stop this 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.650
 read there you can write on it 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.660
 Of course there is still the one that can 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.390
 you can describe it once and then you can 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.710
 they just read that too 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.730
 interesting especially for developers who 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.160
 want to test things 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.870
 and then there are those you always have 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.940
 can read and describe 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.590
 and they are in this case 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.150
 do not just encrypt it 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 I can now read things 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.230
 read on the tablet so an amigo 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.050
 and these are the data there 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.090
 got done my level is called ego 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.680
 but as you can see there is something 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.230
 just wanted to find that means that too 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.570
 some encryption on it and what 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.300
 Also interesting is my tablet says 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.030
 this sticker has seven password 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.669
 Try that means so thinks 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.110
 at least if you try seven times 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.790
 Has the encryption by password 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.280
 to crack request and it did not work out 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.930
 this nfc tag is unusable 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.050
 I'm not sure, though 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.540
 and because such a nfc day so totally flat 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.360
 it will be the amigos in the near future 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.900
 to give future as chipcards in the 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.030
 senses 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.340
 Of course that's not as cool as 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.440
 to be a figure but to become one 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.360
 they be cheaper 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.130
 of course I do not know and 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.020
 to be easier to transport 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.930
 I'll deal with it now 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.970
 to read some amigos with one 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.400
 smartphone and then see if I am 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.880
 Find differences in the detection 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.090
 and then I can play in my game 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.979
 Kenny away an amigo functionality 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.680
 I can say in which I say you have 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.320
 a mario amigo read in now comes 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.260
 this special opponent for you or you 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.140
 keep this special weapon now 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.140
 if that works and where I say it 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.140
 cool 

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:17.519
 I hope you with this little video 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.359
 the functionality and manner of 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:23.309
 to have brought nfc tags closer and now 

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:25.679
 maybe you understand why anni 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:27.809
 Bus work if you want 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:30.509
 can you share the video would me 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:33.989
 very happy and also writes in the 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:36.179
 comments on what you think about it 

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.969
 this technology makes sense whether the 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:40.379
 Danger to others and whether you yourself 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.739
 interest in it so have time 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.239
 work because such a nfc day costs 30 

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:47.239
 cent 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:53.149
 in this sense until the next time 

00:06:47.239 --> 00:07:01.819
 quality up and down 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:07:01.819
 So we just do it all up
