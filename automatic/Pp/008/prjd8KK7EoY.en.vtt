all<00:00:01.589> right<00:00:01.860> now<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.190> are<00:00:02.310> looking<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:03.030> using

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
all right now we are looking at using

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.260 
all right now we are looking at using
autocad<00:00:04.140> inventor<00:00:04.220> it<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.609> yellow<00:00:05.940> icon

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
autocad inventor it is this yellow icon

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.980 
autocad inventor it is this yellow icon
on<00:00:06.779> your<00:00:06.810> desktop<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:08.389> once<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.540> click<00:00:09.780> on

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
on your desktop and once we click on

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.959 
on your desktop and once we click on
that<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.530> takes<00:00:10.769> two<00:00:11.040> or<00:00:11.070> three<00:00:11.400> minutes<00:00:11.580> for

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
that it takes two or three minutes for

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.370 
that it takes two or three minutes for
it<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> load<00:00:12.300> up<00:00:12.509> since<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.900> such<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> huge

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
it to load up since it's such a huge

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.340 
it to load up since it's such a huge
program<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:15.599> would<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.960> able<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
program and then we would be able to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.170 
program and then we would be able to
start<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.949> would<00:00:17.070> open<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.760> something

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
start and would open up to something

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
start and would open up to something
like<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:19.640> within<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.939> program<00:00:21.920> there's<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
like this within this program there's a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
like this within this program there's a
lot<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> different<00:00:23.480> differences<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> lot

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
lot of different differences but a lot

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
lot of different differences but a lot
of<00:00:24.990> similarities<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.830> autocad<00:00:26.400> we're<00:00:27.119> going

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
of similarities to autocad we're going

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.929 
of similarities to autocad we're going
to<00:00:27.330> come<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> new<00:00:28.939> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
to come up here and go to the new and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
to come up here and go to the new and
what<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.660> most<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> time<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
what we're going to do most the time is

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.240 
what we're going to do most the time is
this<00:00:32.040> standard<00:00:32.640> ipt<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> part<00:00:34.320> these

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this standard ipt which is a part these

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.220 
this standard ipt which is a part these
other<00:00:35.460> things<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.840> some

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
other things do have to do with some

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
other things do have to do with some
different<00:00:37.710> types<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> parts<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> make

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
different types of parts we can make

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
different types of parts we can make
that<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> standard<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.989> PT<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:40.770> we're

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that the standard I PT is what we're

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.950 
that the standard I PT is what we're
going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.280> using<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.570> would<00:00:42.719> hit<00:00:42.840> okay

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
going to be using and we would hit okay

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
going to be using and we would hit okay
it'll<00:00:45.960> roll<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.649> into<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.340> gritty<00:00:47.820> type<00:00:48.120> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it'll roll up into this gritty type of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.160 
it'll roll up into this gritty type of
piece<00:00:48.899> over<00:00:49.200> here

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.349 

and<00:00:54.769> same<00:00:55.219> thing<00:00:55.250> we<00:00:55.609> can<00:00:55.760> zoom<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.329> zoom

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
and same thing we can zoom in and zoom

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.930 
and same thing we can zoom in and zoom
out<00:00:56.660> by<00:00:56.870> using<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.320> roller<00:00:57.530> mouse<00:00:57.859> we've<00:00:58.730> got

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
out by using the roller mouse we've got

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.720 
out by using the roller mouse we've got
the<00:00:59.120> browser<00:00:59.390> bar<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.199> is<00:01:00.320> over<00:01:00.620> here<00:01:01.039> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
the browser bar that is over here and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.670 
the browser bar that is over here and
then<00:01:02.120> we've<00:01:02.239> got<00:01:02.269> how<00:01:02.659> to<00:01:02.690> draw<00:01:02.989> lines<00:01:03.379> and

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
then we've got how to draw lines and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.229 
then we've got how to draw lines and
rectangles<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.309> stuff<00:01:04.549> up<00:01:04.699> here<00:01:04.879> all<00:01:05.059> that

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
rectangles and stuff up here all that

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.389 
rectangles and stuff up here all that
stuff<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.720> very<00:01:05.899> very<00:01:06.259> similar<00:01:06.649> notice<00:01:07.189> if<00:01:07.310> we

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
stuff is very very similar notice if we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.399 
stuff is very very similar notice if we
go<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.729> modify<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.420> have<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.689> trim<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.380> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
go to the modify we have to trim and the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.100 
go to the modify we have to trim and the
copy<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.009> move<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.360> same<00:01:11.600> ones<00:01:11.869> we

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
copy in the move all the same ones we

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.380 
copy in the move all the same ones we
had<00:01:12.289> for<00:01:12.500> model<00:01:12.890> cad<00:01:13.119> well<00:01:14.119> i'm<00:01:14.180> going<00:01:14.330> to

gives<00:02:11.420> me<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:12.070> solid<00:02:13.070> modeling<00:02:13.640> stuff<00:02:13.940> like

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
gives me some solid modeling stuff like

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.509 
gives me some solid modeling stuff like
extrude<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.170> revolve<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.950> laughed<00:02:16.250> and

stuff<00:02:17.380> over<00:02:18.380> here<00:02:18.410> on<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> right<00:02:18.980> hand<00:02:19.190> side

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
stuff over here on the right hand side

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.020 
stuff over here on the right hand side
there<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:19.790> an<00:02:20.030> orbit<00:02:20.510> button<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.850> what<00:02:22.850> that

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
there is an orbit button and what that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.520 
there is an orbit button and what that
allow<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.600> is<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.810> kind<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.049> rotate<00:02:24.410> it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
allow you to do is to kind of rotate it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.250 
allow you to do is to kind of rotate it
around<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:24.859> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:24.980> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.370> see<00:02:26.200> see<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
around so you can kind of see see it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.949 
around so you can kind of see see it
from<00:02:27.380> different<00:02:27.590> angles<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.370> things<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
from different angles and things and and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.319 
from different angles and things and and
i<00:02:30.170> am<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:31.459> can<00:02:31.579> click<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> left

i am going to you can click on the left

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.090 
i am going to you can click on the left
over<00:02:32.630> here<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:32.959> rectangle<00:02:33.709> i<00:02:33.769> can<00:02:33.950> move

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
over here on this rectangle i can move

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.960 
over here on this rectangle i can move
it<00:02:34.280> around<00:02:34.370> on<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.970> one<00:02:35.150> as<00:02:35.269> well<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.880> i

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
it around on this one as well and i

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.479 
it around on this one as well and i
could<00:02:38.120> say<00:02:38.239> hey<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.540> front<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:40.280> where

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
could say hey the front and that's where

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.009 
could say hey the front and that's where
we<00:02:40.519> were<00:02:40.760> at<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.209> moment<00:02:41.540> ago<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:41.870> can

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
we were at just a moment ago so we can

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.559 
we were at just a moment ago so we can
rotate<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.560> around<00:02:42.790> by<00:02:43.790> doing<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.510> i'm

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
rotate it around by doing this and i'm

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.880 
rotate it around by doing this and i'm
just<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.840> kind<00:02:45.049> of<00:02:45.109> tweak<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> little

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
just going to kind of tweak it a little

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.300 
just going to kind of tweak it a little
bit<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.310> when<00:02:46.459> we<00:02:46.609> make<00:02:46.819> this<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.030> solid<00:02:47.510> model

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
bit so when we make this a solid model

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.160 
bit so when we make this a solid model
we<00:02:49.310> can<00:02:49.489> start<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:50.690> gonna<00:02:50.780> come<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.019> and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
we can start so I'm gonna come up and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.640 
we can start so I'm gonna come up and
hit<00:02:51.230> extrude<00:02:52.660> when<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.690> hit<00:02:53.870> extrude<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.470> says

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
hit extrude when I hit extrude it says

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.039 
hit extrude when I hit extrude it says
hey<00:02:54.769> what<00:02:54.980> do<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.069> want<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> extrude<00:02:55.670> it

hey what do you want to extrude it

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.390 
hey what do you want to extrude it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
automatically selects the only thing on

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.550 
automatically selects the only thing on
there<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.269> is<00:02:59.420> called<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.720> profile<00:03:00.260> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
there and it this is called a profile so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.770 
there and it this is called a profile so
it's<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.769> solid<00:03:00.950> profile<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.940> I'm<00:03:02.569> going<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
it's a solid profile and I'm going to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.240 
it's a solid profile and I'm going to
come<00:03:02.930> up<00:03:03.049> here<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.230> change<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.739> dimension

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
come up here and change that dimension

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.980 
come up here and change that dimension
to<00:03:04.670> 4<00:03:04.970> inches<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:06.349> I'm<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.650> hit<00:03:06.769> OK

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
to go over here to this orbit button and

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.409 
to go over here to this orbit button and
i'm<00:04:25.100> going<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.250> tweak<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.700> again<00:04:25.940> just<00:04:26.060> off<00:04:26.240> the

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
i'm going to tweak it again just off the

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.450 
i'm going to tweak it again just off the
site<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.750> can<00:04:26.780> kind<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.140> see<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:28.100> solid

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
site so I can kind of see the solid

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.969 
site so I can kind of see the solid
modeling<00:04:28.910> as<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.270> happens<00:04:29.660> I'm<00:04:30.560> going<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.830> go

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
modeling as it happens I'm going to go

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.240 
modeling as it happens I'm going to go
to<00:04:31.039> extrude<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.570> now<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:33.620> time<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.070> doesn't

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
to extrude and now this time it doesn't

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.950 
to extrude and now this time it doesn't
automatically<00:04:34.880> select<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.479> because<00:04:35.810> there

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
automatically select it because there

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.810 
automatically select it because there
are<00:04:36.050> two<00:04:36.410> different<00:04:36.800> profiles<00:04:37.310> there's<00:04:37.729> a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
are two different profiles there's a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.659 
are two different profiles there's a
profile<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.840> big<00:04:39.500> piece<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.070> then

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
profile of the big piece and then

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.700 
profile of the big piece and then
there's<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.000> profile<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.810> actual<00:04:42.200> circle

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
there's a profile of the actual circle

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.260 
there's a profile of the actual circle
you<00:04:42.800> can<00:04:42.919> tell<00:04:43.130> there's<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.400> highlights<00:04:44.150> a

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
you can tell there's a highlights a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.590 
little differently there so I'm going to
select<00:04:45.410> on<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.760> creates<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.360> i'm
