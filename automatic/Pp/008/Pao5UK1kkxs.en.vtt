00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.760
 somehow everything here podium 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.750
 microphone headlights ask 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.449
 answer 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 but somehow everything else 70 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 Members of the hockey club replace the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.270
 otherwise usual with the rows 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.940
 the journalistic interests 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.890
 otherwise everything true to the original one 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.170
 real press conference next to kevin 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.899
 Volland and Tobias strobel and something 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.899
 other admittedly tricky questions 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.160
 in this stadium 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.160
 I do not have a clue 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.720
 You can not and do not have to do everything 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.060
 know how high how wide 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.160
 main thing you know where it says so 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 harmless in intake and exhaustion the questions 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.220
 for the most part were 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.320
 one or two junior reporters 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.960
 wanted to know it exactly important 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.310
 is to ask the question that hurt the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.310
 supervise editor 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:45.720
 press conference the question is everyone 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.770
 ambitious that's clear we want each one 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 win and play is important I think 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 that you also stay on the ground and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.520
 In the past years, we have stock 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.080
 Everything where you were two years ago 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.490
 example of champions league talked 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.570
 It also did that very quickly 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.790
 can go back 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.810
 and that's why we are this year 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.270
 just a bit reserved 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 clearly want the top of it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.690
 stay 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.610
 now stand and follow the fans but 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.530
 In principle it is important to us that we 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.110
 increase the distance to the rear 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.540
 So again, do not be careful 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 nail down leave diplomatic 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 important who wants to have another who has 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.790
 Not 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.860
 no problem that happens on the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.230
 real journalists now and then it works 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.800
 continue to strike the next 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.480
 please football 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.950
 because I would not call so 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.710
 I believe that we already have others 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.450
 calibers that call themselves that 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.340
 For example, one can rely on one 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.670
 next to me 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.920
 holland roberto firminho we are whole 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 normal people so we are nothing 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.520
 special even if we now before 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.530
 but we are playing several spectators 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.070
 Just have our our hobby to 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.560
 job and I think that's it 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.110
 what distinguishes us or it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 Anyone can do it if he is the dumb one 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.740
 or simply has the courage to do so 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.270
 giving everything in the background too 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.680
 Just ask and football profi 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.590
 I hope that you are your goal 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.170
 could someday fulfill tips 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.760
 from the profi is noted and around the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:51.180
 make history around one more 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:52.830
 last info please so for example yes 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.580
 three years ago so i want now 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:00.870
 my third season at recordings 2013 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.150
 now it was the third one 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.150
 So it was not like that 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.760
 that was 2003 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.260
 my third should say very well 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.720
 rich for a beautiful story around 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.130
 I hope strobel and volland for that 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.690
 corresponding photo around the whole 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.660
 neatly picture will of course 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.410
 Also worried cameras are hollow enough 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.720
 in use 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.370
 to say goodbye there are autographs 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.350
 maybe the only one on the way 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.260
 note that it is not 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.470
 traded for a real press conference 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.470
 Has
