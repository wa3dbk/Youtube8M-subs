made the hole to make it a little bit

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
made the hole to make it a little bit
bigger<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.399> too<00:01:59.579> hard<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.390> is

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you can see I'm making a big enough hole

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.010 
you can see I'm making a big enough hole
that<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.170> blow<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> top<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that I can blow the top of it and the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.420 
that I can blow the top of it and the
egg<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.349> actually<00:02:10.770> come<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> other<00:02:11.310> end

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
egg will actually come out the other end

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.750 
egg will actually come out the other end
so<00:02:11.819> here<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.150> my<00:02:12.330> gorgeous<00:02:12.690> assistant

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.890 
so here is my gorgeous assistant
Gabe<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.769> she<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:16.129> just<00:02:16.909> blowing<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> top<00:02:17.720> of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
Gabe and she is just blowing the top of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.860 
Gabe and she is just blowing the top of
the<00:02:18.049> egg<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.769> see<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:20.239> inside<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the egg and you see the inside of the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.839 
the egg and you see the inside of the
egg<00:02:20.989> starts<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.530> blow<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
egg starts to blow out into the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.030 
egg starts to blow out into the
container<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.049> just<00:02:24.349> give<00:02:24.500> my<00:02:24.680> eggs<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
container and then I just give my eggs a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.809 
container and then I just give my eggs a
good<00:02:25.190> rinse<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.959> I'm<00:02:26.959> ready<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:33.819> the

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
good rinse and I'm ready to go and the

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.150 
good rinse and I'm ready to go and the
next<00:02:35.120> step<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.599> to<00:02:35.810> grab<00:02:35.989> my<00:02:36.140> alcohol<00:02:36.650> ink<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
next step is to grab my alcohol ink and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.979 
next step is to grab my alcohol ink and
I'm<00:02:37.340> using<00:02:37.580> two<00:02:37.730> colors<00:02:38.060> keep<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.660> mind<00:02:38.870> that

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
I'm using two colors keep in mind that

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.420 
I'm using two colors keep in mind that
you<00:02:39.110> don't<00:02:39.319> want<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.590> use<00:02:39.709> complementary

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
you don't want to use complementary

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.670 
you don't want to use complementary
colors<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:41.000> red<00:02:41.599> and<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.989> green<00:02:42.019> mixed<00:02:42.560> together

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
colors a red and a green mixed together

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.589 
colors a red and a green mixed together
will<00:02:43.069> make<00:02:43.159> kind<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.640> murky<00:02:43.879> brown<00:02:44.269> color

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
will make kind of a murky brown color

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.869 
will make kind of a murky brown color
and<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.379> I'm<00:02:45.530> using<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.980> pretty<00:02:46.370> blue<00:02:46.849> and

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
and so I'm using this pretty blue and

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.440 
and so I'm using this pretty blue and
then<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.599> bright<00:02:47.900> green<00:02:47.930> color<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.450> I

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
then this bright green color and I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.150 
then this bright green color and I
wanted<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> pick<00:02:51.110> out<00:02:51.260> colors<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.859> kind<00:02:52.069> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
wanted to pick out colors that kind of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.449 
wanted to pick out colors that kind of
went<00:02:52.310> along<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.760> spring<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:54.250> you're<00:02:55.250> going

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
went along with spring and you're going

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.550 
went along with spring and you're going
to<00:02:55.579> put<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> few<00:02:56.120> dabs<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.690> each<00:02:56.930> color<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.530> I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
to put a few dabs of each color so I

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.470 
to put a few dabs of each color so I
just<00:02:57.890> hold<00:02:58.099> my<00:02:58.280> ink<00:02:58.459> down<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:58.819> count<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.150> three

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
just hold my ink down and count to three

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.780 
just hold my ink down and count to three
and<00:02:59.690> I've<00:03:00.620> got<00:03:00.799> four<00:03:01.010> little<00:03:01.160> dabs<00:03:01.459> with<00:03:01.670> my

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and I've got four little dabs with my

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.509 
and I've got four little dabs with my
ink<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.150> there<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.569> I'm<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:03.890> gently

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
ink on there and I'm going to gently

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.330 
ink on there and I'm going to gently
gently<00:03:05.150> stamp<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.230> onto<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.739> side<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.160> egg

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
gently stamp it onto the side of the egg

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.949 
gently stamp it onto the side of the egg
now<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.640> don't<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.450> push<00:03:08.660> too<00:03:08.690> hard

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
now you don't want to push too hard

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.530 
now you don't want to push too hard
because<00:03:09.859> if<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.579> you<00:03:10.970> will<00:03:11.120> break<00:03:11.390> your

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
because if you do you will break your

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.910 
because if you do you will break your
eggshell<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:11.959> that's<00:03:12.319> no<00:03:12.650> fun

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
eggshell and that's no fun

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.610 
eggshell and that's no fun
and<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.730> just<00:03:14.060> hold<00:03:14.359> the<00:03:14.690> egg<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.349> hand

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and so I just hold the egg in my hand

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.210 
and so I just hold the egg in my hand
and<00:03:16.090> gently<00:03:17.090> press<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.079> ink<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.739> side<00:03:19.069> of

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
and gently press the ink to the side of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.280 
and gently press the ink to the side of
the<00:03:19.340> egg<00:03:19.489> kind<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:20.030> moving<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.630> stamp<00:03:20.900> around

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the egg kind of moving the stamp around

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.129 
the egg kind of moving the stamp around
so<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> doesn't<00:03:22.760> stamp<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.299> exact<00:03:23.720> same

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
so that it doesn't stamp the exact same

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.240 
so that it doesn't stamp the exact same
in<00:03:24.819> every<00:03:25.819> spot<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:26.540> you'll<00:03:27.440> see<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.889> starts

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
in every spot and you'll see it starts

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.400 
in every spot and you'll see it starts
to<00:03:28.340> spread<00:03:28.819> beautifully<00:03:29.419> across<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.079> side<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
to spread beautifully across the side of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.370 
to spread beautifully across the side of
the<00:03:30.560> egg<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.980> I'll<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.730> one<00:03:32.299> layer<00:03:32.599> across<00:03:33.049> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the egg and I'll do one layer across the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.440 
the egg and I'll do one layer across the
whole<00:03:33.590> egg<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.099> then<00:03:34.639> you<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.910> go<00:03:35.030> back<00:03:35.209> over

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
whole egg and then you can go back over
