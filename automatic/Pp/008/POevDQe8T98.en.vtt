00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.089
 Hello everyone, today I am going to show you a 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 little elves the effectiveness that 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:11.370
 they have these troops in battle 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 well let's start 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.890
 as you can see in the record of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 attacks I'm stealing for pretty well 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 ok before you start with the goblins 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.430
 goblins attack'll show you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.610
 I just loaded but fine but pretty 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.610
 all right 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.440
 look at the booty that was 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.000
 available 300 thousand two hundred fifty 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.960
 thousand 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.930
 ok it happens that everything was in the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.160
 warehouses worth I already knew what happens 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.860
 that I missed the boil as now 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.140
 you will see I open down there to enter 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.510
 with the giants with a healer to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.900
 the watchers that I have and I go 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.400
 destroying is worth as bic in the 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.960
 collectors there was also quite 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.170
 resources because they are not empty at all 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.079
 I did not leave because with the archers but 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 after I left the ball is worth android 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.220
 with two breaks walls 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.649
 and when should I have thrown where 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 he argued that having thrown by the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.299
 down is worth out there by the threw them for 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.259
 up and that was the shit if the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.899
 I would have thrown down 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 destroyed the two 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.430
 these two warehouses safe these two 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.830
 first and the other two maybe also 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.090
 ok but I'm asshole you have them for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.590
 They were killed above 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.549
 and if robert resources 200 145 thousand that was 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.649
 what interested me what I did not 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.859
 I was interested because I have the stores 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:42.399
 currently filled but I know that it 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:44.640
 They were 153 thousand for the stores 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.800
 in 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.229
 the truth that has been a shame but 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.760
 It has also helped me to show you the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.940
 power that they have where they leave this 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.710
 video as you have seen have displaced 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 all all the collectors from above 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.380
 in a second it has been very fast 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.780
 well after showing you the shit 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.890
 majestic 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 I'm going for another 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.490
 for another attack 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.790
 good as you see right now I'm going with this 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.610
 army is always worth someone 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.380
 you asked 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.480
 you have not made recommendations for me 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.180
 that go with another type of army and such 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.300
 I in the videos what I teach you or 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.220
 just make armies 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.140
 that do not work very well but it stops them 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.670
 show the effectiveness of each unit 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.430
 first I made the barbarians to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.840
 teach you the barbarians how they went as 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.370
 would be a script the soldiers after 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.080
 the archers 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.180
 but usually when I play 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.610
 games do not play with armies 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.600
 no no no obviously if I could win it 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.830
 game with these armies is worth 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:59.030
 they are mixed they are worth 10 goblins 44 breaks 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.420
 walls a healer 40 archers 118 and 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 giant people and 23 goals worth and two 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.760
 spells 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.920
 and he told me forming better 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.110
 if you mostly to catch the elixir 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.650
 dark if the villages that attacked have 80 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.280
 thousand of the minimum dark exile 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.590
 and maximum 100,000 from 60 thousand to 100 thousand 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.880
 attacked but without spending it 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.810
 but without spending the spells 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.100
 if it exceeds 100,000 it attacked and spent 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.080
 spells and so we always win 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.080
 well I will teach you now is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.530
 here as you can see are all the resources 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.330
 in the mines then it was very easy 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.340
 loose out there the giants the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.890
 we break to enter the tower of magicians 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.500
 and destroy it more giants and archers by 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.270
 all sides are scattered a little 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.160
 so that no mortars against Porto 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.650
 they arrive but good so that they do not 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.110
 respect when they are approaching 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.110
 Now imagine before I bought walls 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.110
 and more archers out there 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.140
 I brought the gifts to help a 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.769
 little bit to the goalkeepers 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.049
 as you see the gifts 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.690
 sepe so fast new mines 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.490
 and they go 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.320
 now how bad are they staying against a 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.590
 wall and then the tower of magicians the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.590
 peta 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:37.199
 good for here there is nothing the 

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:40.809
 goal that was to get the resources 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.940
 he's got it worth 160,000 elixir 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:45.750
 of 180,000 gold 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.780
 a very good attack me at these levels 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.210
 as learned from the great Alvaro 845 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.689
 I'm always firm to the cups more or 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.519
 less has gone up 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.299
 I'm around one thousand five thousand 

00:04:55.519 --> 00:05:01.580
 two hundred but I will not upload the never 

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:04.639
 is contaminating the glasses ever when 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.070
 ye to the village level 9 Level Eight 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.890
 maybe I'll go for drinks but for now 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.900
 the main thing is to get resources we 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.250
 continue that did not bother me anyway 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 I usually always get the 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.260
 50 percent but by city councils 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.810
 because this is pretty basic to serve 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.980
 pretty good but of course even if I get 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.290
 drinks later with the city councils 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.600
 they were removed so for me it 's a 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.400
 good priority what else to say 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.610
 I'm not going to teach more attacks anymore, I'm not going to 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.770
 comment that as you can see I already have almost 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.900
 all went up I need to go to the warehouse 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.300
 this evil exposed the 9 raise it to level 10 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.560
 and then without defenses I had a tower 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.290
 magicians and already it is this that is 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.310
 finishing the air defense and I would have 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.110
 everyone would only stay this camp 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.600
 of important things and the barracks 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.120
 they removed that barracks but I'm going 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.850
 what will I do when I finish 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.030
 in this this worker to work here 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.160
 in a camp then surely 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.310
 I'm going to improve the town hall at level 7 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.860
 It's worth it because I already have a surplus 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.570
 I am golden expression I have two plates 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.700
 full but I can not I will not catch them 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.900
 because I have it full of the warehouse like this 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.110
 that I'm going to go for the town hall and in 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.699
 the six days it takes I'll finish the 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.430
 buildings 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.900
 I will try the wall to climb the minimum to everything 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.120
 Now that I think I can 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.520
 get 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.010
 so nothing if you liked to give 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.300
 like or comment something and see you in the 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.300
 next episode see you later
