00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.139 
seeds can sprout easy and what we want
to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.670> get<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> pencil<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.219> make<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.760> little

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to do is get a pencil and make a little

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.900 
to do is get a pencil and make a little
hole<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> middle<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:52.129> with<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> flowers

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
hole in the middle and with the flowers

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.200 
hole in the middle and with the flowers

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.310 
I'm going to try to put in two seeds in
each<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> know<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> takes<00:01:00.870> Joey

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
each so so we know that it takes Joey

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.119 
each so so we know that it takes Joey
get<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.719> anyway<00:01:03.750> drop<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> few<00:01:04.830> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
get out of here anyway drop a few in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.700 
get out of here anyway drop a few in
each<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> even<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
each so and even if you get one in there

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:22.030 
each so and even if you get one in there
it's<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.460> fine

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040 

and<00:01:22.490> these<00:01:22.790> will<00:01:23.090> take<00:01:23.800> anywhere<00:01:24.800> from<00:01:26.050> three

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
and these will take anywhere from three

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.320 
and these will take anywhere from three
to<00:01:27.080> seven<00:01:27.440> days<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.830> germinate<00:01:28.730> it's<00:01:29.060> not

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
to seven days to germinate it's not

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.320 
to seven days to germinate it's not
gonna<00:01:29.510> take<00:01:29.870> long

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
gonna take long

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.390 
gonna take long
so<00:01:32.330> we'll<00:01:32.510> cover<00:01:32.780> them<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.170> again<00:01:33.920> really

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
so we'll cover them up again really

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.370 
so we'll cover them up again really
