00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
there could be energy crisis in there so

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:55.640 
there could be energy crisis in there so
let's<00:03:45.960> check<00:03:54.050> yeah<00:03:55.050> I've<00:03:55.170> only<00:03:55.320> found<00:03:55.500> two

let's check yeah I've only found two
energy<00:03:56.040> crystals<00:03:56.490> so<00:03:56.700> far<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.960> is

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
energy crystals so far this is

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:14.330 
energy crystals so far this is
ridiculous<00:04:08.300> now<00:04:09.300> I've<00:04:09.450> pushed<00:04:12.230> okay<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.860> get

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
standard capper so if the ground Griner

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:26.240 
standard capper so if the ground Griner
vez<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.510> gonna<00:05:18.750> roll<00:05:18.960> fast

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.710 

actually<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:30.700> takes<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.030> walk<00:05:31.150> from<00:05:31.300> got<00:05:31.480> to<00:05:31.600> get

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
actually it takes a walk from got to get

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:42.180 
actually it takes a walk from got to get
there<00:05:34.080> he<00:05:35.080> does<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:37.600> work<00:05:40.080> everyone<00:05:41.080> get<00:05:41.919> the

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
hell out of there is one side is going

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.120 
hell out of there is one side is going
to<00:05:52.450> be<00:05:52.540> granite<00:05:52.840> grinded<00:05:55.650> yaad<00:05:56.650> alright<00:05:56.950> is

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
to be granite grinded yaad alright is

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:06.930 
to be granite grinded yaad alright is
going<00:05:57.340> to<00:05:57.400> go<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:59.440> old-fashioned<00:06:00.130> way<00:06:05.940> you

going to go the old-fashioned way you
see<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.180> ground<00:06:07.419> wire<00:06:07.660> is<00:06:07.840> a<00:06:07.870> lot<00:06:08.080> faster<00:06:20.490> okay

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
see the ground wire is a lot faster okay

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.990 
see the ground wire is a lot faster okay
you<00:06:21.550> get<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.750> way<00:06:25.710> see<00:06:26.710> that's<00:06:27.160> all<00:06:27.669> it<00:06:27.789> rock

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
you get the way see that's all it rock
