00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.490
 P.S 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.240
 and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.240
 cock pinches your ambition 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:42.910
 and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.160
 berger o and it's okay poor videos for 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.600
 give extinction gifts to children 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 two poor little edges 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.280
 and 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.449
 today 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.450
 sometimes the head as if it were 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.450
 loaded the pubis 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 rich 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.010
 but everyone, because here we are in a 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.590
 new video what they will be seeing from 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.920
 background is going to be the update of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.440
 gta 5 online Christmas you know that a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.970
 rockstar likes to put festive things 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.340
 not if we are at Christmas they put things of 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.290
 halloween christmas halloween and then 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.479
 Well, I think it's something, let's say 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.800
 quite nice to me I like to see that 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.840
 I like that to face this type of 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.270
 things I know they could add a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.040
 little bit more stuff but it's good 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.960
 it's fine, we do not have to complain, it's 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.240
 Free content does not charge you anything good 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.860
 in if you do not charge anything apart from what 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.600
 you already paid for your game that is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.910
 very expensive but good I do not come to talk 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.910
 of this I'm basically going to use this 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.620
 video to tell you that today or 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.730
 tomorrow I do not know what day I'm going to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.410
 go up if it's day 23 I think it's the day 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.420
 in which the channel reaches a year not 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.480
 I am very sure the truth but I think that 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.070
 is when the channel is one year old so 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.900
 this is a video basically of 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.459
 thank you but just the same if you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.709
 concentrate on what is happening 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.170
 gameplay you can see the location of 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.120
 a christmas tree in gta 5 you can see 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 Christmas tree 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.010
 the department you can see then many 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.569
 things that I dedicated myself to record and good the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.670
 another guy and the other one who makes the channel 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.830
 right now he's on vacation the fucking 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.019
 it was on vacation and then he's going to have to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.489
 this video to thank myself 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.530
 the truth I had not remembered that 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.120
 we're going to be one year old and that's why 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.709
 that we did not record it before we knew 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.180
 we would have recorded it before the two but 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.489
 Well, I did not fart and surely 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.500
 to also and good, basically just 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.090
 I want to say thank you, thank you, 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.190
 to 10 thousand 600 or 10,000 700 in a year is 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.379
 a figure that was unimaginable to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.609
 we, we thought a lot 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.799
 least it was truly an incredible year in 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.510
 youtube good our first year in 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.060
 youtube there is no point of comparison 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.769
 with other years but let's say it was 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.859
 pretty good I've seen people who 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:29.230
 estanca in 500 are here in 1902 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.420
 also roe helped us to start and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.030
 well, we continue and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.430
 fortunately we could highlight a 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.230
 little I know that 10,000 is not much I 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.910
 I know that you get to see a fucking 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.770

 to have a lot more activity than 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.740
 We had school hours because 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.570
