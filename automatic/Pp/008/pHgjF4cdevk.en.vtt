with ease don't get too mad
let's<00:02:57.390> not<00:02:57.630> enough<00:02:59.450> one<00:03:00.450> half<00:03:07.430> almost<00:03:08.430> two

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700

them<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.849> right<00:03:35.969> place<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.709> exactly

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
them in the right place this is exactly

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.170 
them in the right place this is exactly
the<00:03:38.700> same<00:03:38.909> again<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:40.340> this<00:03:41.340> time<00:03:41.670> though<00:03:41.909> I'm

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
the same again and this time though I'm

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.170 
the same again and this time though I'm
going<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.510> put<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.319> holes<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.400> just

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
going to put the holes in now I just

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.530 
going to put the holes in now I just
call<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.719> one<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.290> button<00:03:46.739> blank<00:03:47.239> because<00:03:48.239> I'm

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
call this one a button blank because I'm

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.179 
call this one a button blank because I'm
going<00:03:48.719> to<00:03:48.840> cover<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.500> doesn't<00:03:49.680> really

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
going to cover it so it doesn't really

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:57.349 
going to cover it so it doesn't really
matter<00:03:50.930> what<00:03:55.189> card<00:03:56.189> you<00:03:56.459> use<00:03:56.669> or<00:03:56.909> what<00:03:57.090> color

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
matter what card you use or what color

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:04.640 
matter what card you use or what color
because<00:03:58.019> you're<00:03:58.169> not<00:03:58.260> going<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.799> it<00:04:03.650> again

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
because you're not going to see it again

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.589 
because you're not going to see it again
I'm<00:04:05.069> only<00:04:05.159> going<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.459> put<00:04:05.609> two<00:04:05.849> holes<00:04:06.060> I'll

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
I'm only going to put two holes I'll

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.089 
I'm only going to put two holes I'll
show<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.079> what<00:04:07.230> they<00:04:07.349> look<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.859> four

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
show you what they look like with four

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.440 
show you what they look like with four
holes<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.790> entirely<00:04:09.359> up<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:12.169> later<00:04:13.169> on

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
holes it's entirely up to you later on

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.449 
holes it's entirely up to you later on
and<00:04:15.450> then<00:04:16.169> I'm<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.799> cover<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.250> one

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
and then I'm going to cover this one

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.129 
and then I'm going to cover this one
it's<00:04:17.579> pretty<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:18.470> pretty<00:04:19.699> mulberry<00:04:20.699> again

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
it's pretty a pretty mulberry again

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.860 
it's pretty a pretty mulberry again
because<00:04:22.139> they<00:04:22.410> seem<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.949> absorb<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.760> wet<00:04:24.599> glue

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
because they seem to absorb the wet glue

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.730 
because they seem to absorb the wet glue
pretty<00:04:25.500> well<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.979> then<00:04:26.460> they<00:04:26.639> set<00:04:26.940> quite<00:04:27.270> hard

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
pretty well and then they set quite hard

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.740 
pretty well and then they set quite hard
so<00:04:28.740> again<00:04:30.080> this<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.289> going<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.560> be<00:04:31.650> all<00:04:31.830> over

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so again this is going to be all over

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.909 
so again this is going to be all over
don't<00:04:33.750> worry<00:04:33.870> if<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.229> get<00:04:34.349> it<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> holes

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
don't worry if you get it in the holes

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.500 
don't worry if you get it in the holes
because<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.550> will<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:35.849> help<00:04:35.940> them<00:04:36.360> all

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
because that will just help them all

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.029 
because that will just help them all

that all I'm going to do is now I'm
going<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:47.270> press<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.479> onto<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.050> front<00:04:50.570> make

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
going to press it onto the front make

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.529 
going to press it onto the front make
sure<00:04:51.599> it's<00:04:51.990> were<00:04:52.229> in<00:04:52.440> place<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.949> have<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.520> quite<00:04:54.300> a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
big and head to my ball tool and just

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.080 
big and head to my ball tool and just
run<00:05:01.470> it<00:05:01.500> round

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.580 

should<00:05:07.090> be<00:05:07.330> putting<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:09.400> well-fed<00:05:10.590> pair

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
should be putting the well-fed pair

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.300 
should be putting the well-fed pair
fizzes<00:05:11.979> and<00:05:13.229> don't<00:05:14.229> leave<00:05:14.440> too<00:05:14.740> much<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.220> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
fizzes and don't leave too much of the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:24.990 
fizzes and don't leave too much of the
water<00:05:16.500> but<00:05:17.500> enough<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:18.100> flap<00:05:18.340> over<00:05:24.000> this

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
water but enough to flap over this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.050 
water but enough to flap over this
roughly<00:05:25.479> cut<00:05:25.810> round

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
roughly cut round

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.409 
roughly cut round
it<00:05:28.060> doesn't<00:05:28.389> have<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.660> be<00:05:28.810> precise<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:30.330> put<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
it doesn't have to be precise I put the

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.170 
it doesn't have to be precise I put the
glue<00:05:31.720> on<00:05:31.750> now<00:05:32.139> because<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.220> makes<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.699> easier

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
glue on now because it makes it easier

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.420 
glue on now because it makes it easier
for<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:35.580> mean<00:05:36.580> yeah<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:38.500> just<00:05:38.560> makes<00:05:38.889> it<00:05:39.070> easier

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
for I mean yeah it just makes it easier

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.550 
for I mean yeah it just makes it easier
than<00:05:39.520> having<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:40.120> contend<00:05:40.990> with<00:05:41.139> lots<00:05:41.440> of

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
than having to contend with lots of

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.430 
than having to contend with lots of
little<00:05:41.740> flaps<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.570> it's<00:05:43.570> just<00:05:43.780> as<00:05:43.930> easy<00:05:44.080> to

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
little flaps and it's just as easy to

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.520 
little flaps and it's just as easy to
cut<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:47.289> do<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.710> as<00:05:49.770> thin<00:05:50.770> as<00:05:50.919> you<00:05:50.949> like<00:05:51.070> or

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
cut you do this as thin as you like or

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.689 
cut you do this as thin as you like or
I'm<00:05:53.530> doing<00:05:53.710> this<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:53.919> little<00:05:54.070> bit<00:05:54.310> thicker

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
I'm doing this a little bit thicker

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.500 
I'm doing this a little bit thicker
because<00:05:55.570> I'm<00:05:55.810> trying<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.199> show<00:05:56.289> you<00:05:57.510> quickly

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
because I'm trying to show you quickly

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.870 
because I'm trying to show you quickly
rather<00:05:59.229> than<00:05:59.620> wasting<00:06:00.310> all<00:06:00.610> your<00:06:00.669> time

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
rather than wasting all your time

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:11.020 
rather than wasting all your time
watching<00:06:01.690> me<00:06:02.050> cut<00:06:02.410> little<00:06:02.620> trip<00:06:06.690> everywhere

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.220 

as<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.180> can<00:06:12.300> see<00:06:12.480> it<00:06:12.540> doesn't<00:06:12.810> take<00:06:12.960> very<00:06:12.990> long

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
as you can see it doesn't take very long

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.080 
as you can see it doesn't take very long
to<00:06:13.380> do<00:06:13.680> about<00:06:13.890> them<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:17.370> then<00:06:17.490> just<00:06:17.520> firm<00:06:17.910> it

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
to do about them and then just firm it

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:27.290 
to do about them and then just firm it
round<00:06:18.330> just<00:06:19.200> keep<00:06:19.440> working<00:06:19.860> it<00:06:19.950> round<00:06:26.300> and

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
round just keep working it round and

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.150 
round just keep working it round and
using<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.870> take<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.110> lot<00:06:28.380> longer<00:06:28.560> doing<00:06:29.010> your

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
using to take a lot longer doing your

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.010 
using to take a lot longer doing your
buttons<00:06:29.490> and<00:06:29.640> you'll<00:06:29.760> be<00:06:30.270> getting<00:06:30.390> much<00:06:30.690> finer

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
buttons and you'll be getting much finer

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.450 
buttons and you'll be getting much finer
finish<00:06:32.300> and<00:06:33.300> then<00:06:33.750> me<00:06:33.900> I<00:06:36.110> like<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.410> just<00:06:38.100> smooth

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
finish and then me I like to just smooth

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.820 
finish and then me I like to just smooth
