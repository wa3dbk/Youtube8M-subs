about<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.019> well<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.560> think<00:03:30.769> possibly<00:03:32.410> he

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
about it and well I think possibly he

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.020 
about it and well I think possibly he
wanted<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.799> carry<00:03:34.070> on<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.400> long<00:03:34.580> as<00:03:34.730> he<00:03:34.820> could

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
wanted to carry on as long as he could

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.759 
wanted to carry on as long as he could
you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.600> when<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.959> finish<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.620> know<00:03:36.739> I

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
you know so when you finish you know I

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.340 
you know so when you finish you know I
suppose<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.700> doesn't<00:03:37.970> use<00:03:38.209> 27<00:03:38.900> or<00:03:39.019> 28

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
suppose that that doesn't use 27 or 28

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.910 
suppose that that doesn't use 27 or 28
when<00:03:39.650> he<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:40.060> yeah<00:03:41.060> finished<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.380> the
