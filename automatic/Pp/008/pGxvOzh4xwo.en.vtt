00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello everyone is pedro inaugurates the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.630
 new channel with great tricks 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.769
 a great trick on leakage 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 walker so we start right away 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 so if the team you have some 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.199
 recruitments which you do not like and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.670
 that you do not have a lot of credit to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.930
 invest you go out of football cup 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.970
 so always fast 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.840
 fifa loads will last another 15 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.369
 and a half years so once it will 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.149
 do we go to my club 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.149
 at the very bottom right of the image of a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.079
 fight so that comes out that happens then 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.489
 we 're going to go from a club delete 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.989
 yes so that will remove whole club 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 that's why I'm taking a tale 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.539
 secondary so I also advise of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.280
 take secondary account for 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.890
 remove club because you risk to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.710
 lose all your credits falling so you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.560
 delete it like this you grab 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:09.869
 the code we delete the account 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.070
 that will take you back out of flight 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.750
 in the main menu 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.189
 once you are in the menu 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.659
 main you back in again 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.830
 foot you pass the setting of 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.930
 the explanation of drums of 14 and once 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 that the setting is passed we will 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.759
 find in a brand new heart I do not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.990
 will show you that as you can 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.299
 the boss just as fast the firmly 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 when you want to ps2 wali tendo he 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.100
 there was no load 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.270
 today when you start on sight in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.450
 do you spend more time in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.450
 changes origin 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.190
 So here we go the settings on 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.720
 will have a small bronze team of 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.860
 start as always but that's it 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.430
 we are talking about a leak for the heart 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.870
 so here you go me like that I 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.479
 managed to win this world cup 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.160
 since I had players who we 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 liked in different clubs then 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.480
 after I stopped I have the names of others 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.550
 others count so here we go to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.530
 put again and world cup world 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:34.110
 8 9 10 11 12 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.209
 So here we go , we create a new one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.500
 account that point cup 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.690
 and if we have good players we can 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.940
 keep if we do not have good players 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.320
 we can simply do the same 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.240
 manipulation we can do it 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.790
 four times in addition to creating the 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.120
 so count five times in all you see 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.550
 the bubble lukaku leach bellrays it's not 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.880

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510

 will suit a lot of people who 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.380
