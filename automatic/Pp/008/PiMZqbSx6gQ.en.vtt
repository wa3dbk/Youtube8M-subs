00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
headphones I just bought these are I got

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.820 
headphones I just bought these are I got
this<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.280> t.j.maxx<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.840> originally

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
this at t.j.maxx and it's a originally

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.150 
this at t.j.maxx and it's a originally
from<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.490> sharper<00:00:11.849> image<00:00:12.740> if<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.920> don't<00:00:14.070> know

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
from the sharper image if you don't know

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.410 
from the sharper image if you don't know
anything<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.670> sharper<00:00:14.969> image<00:00:15.000> there

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
anything about the sharper image there

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.140 
anything about the sharper image there
were<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> company<00:00:15.929> back<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.460> late<00:00:17.460> 80s<00:00:17.880> 90s

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
were a company back in the late 80s 90s

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.410 
were a company back in the late 80s 90s
and<00:00:18.480> they<00:00:19.160> apparently<00:00:20.160> went<00:00:20.310> bankrupt<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
and they apparently went bankrupt so I

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.759 
and they apparently went bankrupt so I
guess<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.779> still<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.050> products<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.560> there

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
guess they still have products out there

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
guess they still have products out there
and<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.240> cost<00:00:24.930> me<00:00:25.350> $6<00:00:26.279> $5.99<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.920> know

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
and so this cost me $6 $5.99 and I know

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.730 
and so this cost me $6 $5.99 and I know
the<00:00:29.039> colors<00:00:29.369> kind<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.869> may<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> little<00:00:31.289> girly

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the colors kind of may be a little girly

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.880 
the colors kind of may be a little girly
but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.640> type<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> flamboyant<00:00:33.890> kind

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
but I like that type of flamboyant kind

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.400 
but I like that type of flamboyant kind
of<00:00:34.950> color<00:00:35.160> II<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> sticks<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.570> pops<00:00:36.989> not

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
really pink but almost magenta fuchsia

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.670 
really pink but almost magenta fuchsia
type<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:43.020> doesn't<00:00:43.170> bother<00:00:43.379> me

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
type and it's it doesn't bother me

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.889 
type and it's it doesn't bother me

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
affordable and this one doesn't have a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.970 
affordable and this one doesn't have a
mic<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:54.020> that's<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.230> wanted<00:00:55.530> also<00:00:55.649> because

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.049 
mic so that's what I wanted also because
the<00:00:56.100> mic<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.399> interfering<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.770> my<00:00:58.770> chat<00:00:59.100> for

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the mic was interfering with my chat for

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
the mic was interfering with my chat for
some<00:01:00.210> reason<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.379> avoiding<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
some reason so I I was avoiding the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.630 
some reason so I I was avoiding the
built-in<00:01:02.430> mic<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> anyways<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.040> open<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> up

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
built-in mic so anyways just open it up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
I just got this and that's how it looks

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.469

Oh looks like I got a $10 gift card or
something<00:01:22.640> okay<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.880> hope<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
something okay I hope that's not a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.130 
something okay I hope that's not a
built-in<00:01:25.140> mic<00:01:29.420> see<00:01:30.420> something<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> center

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
built-in mic see something in the center

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.609 
built-in mic see something in the center
there<00:01:31.380> maybe<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.960> part<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.229> part<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
there maybe that's just a part a part of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
there maybe that's just a part a part of
this<00:01:34.770> design<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.670> let's<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:44.840> okay

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this design but let's take a look okay

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.330 
this design but let's take a look okay
doesn't<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.649> doesn't<00:01:46.920> seem<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
doesn't look it doesn't seem to be a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.870 
doesn't look it doesn't seem to be a
built-in<00:01:47.700> mic<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.880> some

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
built-in mic I think it's just a some

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
built-in mic I think it's just a some
type<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:52.850> device<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.680> lengthen<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:55.829> tighten

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
type of a device to lengthen or tighten

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
type of a device to lengthen or tighten
the<00:01:56.280> headset<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.079> more

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the headset so that it's more

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.139 
the headset so that it's more
comfortable

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
comfortable

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.249 
comfortable
probably<00:02:00.149> slides<00:02:04.790> okay<00:02:05.790> no<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.140> seem

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
probably slides okay no it doesn't seem

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.449 
probably slides okay no it doesn't seem
to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.500> sliding<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.250> usually

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
to be sliding up or down usually

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.210 
to be sliding up or down usually
sometimes<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.119> slides<00:02:09.590> like<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> Apple<00:02:11.039> ones

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
sometimes it slides like the Apple ones

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.800 
sometimes it slides like the Apple ones
they<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.489> slide<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.030> maybe<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.629> not

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
they would slide like this maybe I'm not

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.740 
they would slide like this maybe I'm not
pushing<00:02:13.260> hard<00:02:13.470> enough

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
pushing hard enough

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.650 
pushing hard enough
I'm<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.959> gonna<00:02:16.050> force<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> anyways<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
I'm not gonna force it so anyways this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.440 
I'm not gonna force it so anyways this
is<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:20.900> sharper<00:02:21.900> image<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:23.849> that's<00:02:24.060> come

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
is it sharper image and if that's come

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.580 
is it sharper image and if that's come
with<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.750> some<00:02:25.110> additional<00:02:25.560> earbud<00:02:27.590> cushions

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
have right now usually it defaults to a

have right now usually it defaults to a
this<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.140> looks<00:02:37.349> like<00:02:37.470> too<00:02:37.910> small<00:02:39.709> let's<00:02:40.709> see

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
this one looks like too small let's see
