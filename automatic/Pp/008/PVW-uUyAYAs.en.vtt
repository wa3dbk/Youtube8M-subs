a completely new circuit from front to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 
a completely new circuit from front to

Headroom<00:01:00.770> at<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.010> point<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.110> circuit

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Headroom at this point the the circuit

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
Headroom at this point the the circuit
will<00:01:04.320> take<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> hundred<00:01:05.700> thirty-nine

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
will take up to a hundred thirty-nine

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
will take up to a hundred thirty-nine
decibels<00:01:07.280> SPL<00:01:09.530> without<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> pad<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> any<00:01:11.640> sort

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
decibels SPL without a pad of any sort

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.020 
decibels SPL without a pad of any sort
but<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> does<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.920> pads<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> as<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> 10db

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
but it does have two pads it as a 10db

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.990 
but it does have two pads it as a 10db
pad<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> 20<00:01:16.229> DB<00:01:16.590> pad<00:01:16.850> both<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.060> resistive

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
pad and a 20 DB pad both are resistive

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
pad and a 20 DB pad both are resistive
so<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.150> won't<00:01:21.330> mess<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.780> sound<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.740> by

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
so they won't mess up your sound by by

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330 
so they won't mess up your sound by by
having<00:01:23.369> capacitive<00:01:25.100> extra<00:01:26.100> shunt

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
having capacitive extra shunt

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.240 
having capacitive extra shunt

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
capacitance in the signal path also

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
capacitance in the signal path also
there<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:30.030> selectable<00:01:30.869> high-pass

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
there are two selectable high-pass

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
there are two selectable high-pass
filters<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.579> original<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.200> pad

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
filters on the original see for the pad

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.490 
filters on the original see for the pad
and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> high<00:01:35.310> pass<00:01:35.579> functions<00:01:35.880> were

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
and the high pass functions were

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
and the high pass functions were
combined<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.979> could<00:01:38.159> select<00:01:38.520> either<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.090> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
combined you could select either or but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.230 
combined you could select either or but
we've<00:01:39.659> split<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.500> into<00:01:40.619> two<00:01:40.950> discrete<00:01:41.939> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
we've split them up into two discrete so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
we've split them up into two discrete so
you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.990> set<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> different

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can you can set them up in different

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can you can set them up in different
configurations<00:01:44.070> high<00:01:44.850> pass<00:01:45.090> while<00:01:45.840> using<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
configurations high pass while using the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.480 
configurations high pass while using the
pad<00:01:46.439> etc<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> mic<00:01:48.390> very<00:01:49.200> good<00:01:49.409> for<00:01:49.680> drum
