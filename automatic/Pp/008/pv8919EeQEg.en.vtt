00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 

and<00:01:28.830> as<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.220> tell<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.660> faster

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and as you could tell I go way faster

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.040 
and as you could tell I go way faster
than<00:01:31.320> he<00:01:31.980> did<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:33.300> have<00:01:33.660> powered

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
than he did and I don't have powered

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.680 
than he did and I don't have powered
rails<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:35.190> it<00:01:35.370> wasn't<00:01:35.760> exactly<00:01:35.970> timed

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
rails and if it wasn't exactly timed

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.710 
rails and if it wasn't exactly timed
perfectly<00:01:37.080> if<00:01:37.890> anything<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:39.090> went<00:01:39.510> at<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
perfectly if anything we went at the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
perfectly if anything we went at the
same<00:01:39.930> speed<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:41.040> instead<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
same speed but instead I don't have to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
same speed but instead I don't have to
waste<00:01:42.300> my<00:01:42.510> time<00:01:42.690> by<00:01:42.900> getting<00:01:43.200> powered<00:01:43.500> rails

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
waste my time by getting powered rails

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.760 
waste my time by getting powered rails
so<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.850> great<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.390> survival<00:01:46.020> if

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
so this could be great for survival if

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.640 
so this could be great for survival if
you<00:01:47.010> don't<00:01:47.430> want<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.240> waste<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.170> gold<00:01:49.470> on

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
you don't want to waste your gold on

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.740 
you don't want to waste your gold on
powered<00:01:50.040> rails<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.120> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
powered rails you know you can use this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.100 
powered rails you know you can use this
method<00:01:51.990> instead<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.300> get<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> saddle<00:01:54.870> on

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
method instead you just get a saddle on

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.750 
method instead you just get a saddle on
a<00:01:55.229> pig<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.070> i'm<00:01:56.160> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> show<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.490> guys<00:01:56.610> how
