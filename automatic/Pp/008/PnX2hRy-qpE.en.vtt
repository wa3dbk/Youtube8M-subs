00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.280
 but the instinct 

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.990
 the instinct is the identity of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 species 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 it is a combination of emotions and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 talent 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 the instinct has fixed patterns for it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 behaviour 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.890
 who have brains 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.820
 all animals that can move with one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.119
 spine 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.510
 have brains so they can move 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.510
 behave 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.700
 species with brains are fish 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.360
 amphibians reptiles birds and mammals 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 so every animal has the body and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.610
 the brain that they need so that they 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.610
 lead a suitable life 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.850
 like every animal species a unique life 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.020
 unique way of dealing with others 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.600
 sustain themselves 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.129
 some animals can move but 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 don't have a brain like the insects 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.009
 in appearance they resemble us like mammals 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.130
 but they have brain cells 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.569
 horses should have brains 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.569
 also learn a lot in their lives 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.700
 they have a brain and are able to 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.069
 learn how they have a brain and also 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 how they should read a lot during their reading 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.700
 to learn 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.270
 Guinea pigs have a brain 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:34.619
 they must learn and be a little less 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.520
 very instinctively guided animal dogs 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.259
 have a tan and can be dogs 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.990
 able to have a lot to learn 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.729
 particularly social animals 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.369
 every animal species has such a brain because 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.289
 fits that type of animal 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.739
 what I found special is the basis 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.779
 of the brain is similar in structure and the 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.279
 goal of life is liver 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.529
 survive and reproduce 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:01.289
 some animals have a simple one 

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.549
 brown and other animal species have one 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.319
 intricate brown 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.319
 as you people have 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.849
 everything is based on living like you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.180
 are meant to live 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:21.579
 birth determines what you are like 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:25.599
 chicken rabbits cats dogs horses 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:29.079
 people and the life that determines your light 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:33.819
 who you are the more complex the brain 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:36.099
 is more flexible animal is you have animals 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.329
 who have to learn in you have more 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.670
 instinctively 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.750
 sounds animals where the life 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.019
 instinctively 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.810
 but are also intelligent the instinct 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.659
 sit there and who needs to learn during it 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.109
 your life i leave the abc of the brain 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.829
 to explain 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.930
 it looks a bit like a cauliflower 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.069
 but brain is divided into two the same 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.510
 sections are not connected to each other 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.900
 with every part talents and 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.900
 instance 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.510
 Your brains are safely protected in 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.000
 the skull 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 we must grow let be birth 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.569
 she's small in it all the way to it 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.989
 maturity what their horses average 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.019
 The first teacher from lasts 8 to 10 years 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.359
 a horse is the mother and horses learn 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.419
 by example behavior 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.329
 have to look at other and then 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:31.109
 imitate the behavior itself 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.109
 experiment and experience 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.829
 the brain is in the skull 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.930
 and if you would draw a line of eye 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.120
 to ear 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.090
 then you come to the x there sit the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.620
 brain the brain is direct 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.049
 connected to their backbone 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.019
 let's start with a the spinal cord 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.699
 at the bottom of the sketch 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.000
 to make the other one I have a black one 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:57.790
 line drawn in this horse follows that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.930
 black line than long line is it 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.030
 spinal cord 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.000
 Spinal cord is also part of the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.870
 this is well protected by the brain 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.900
 vertebrae 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.319
 that connects the nerves to the horse 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.680
 can move and respond 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.259
 the spinal cord is directly connected to 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.829
 the first part of the brain it 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.960
 cerebellum or the she the small 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.340
 brains 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.650
 the cerebellum is responsible for 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.860
 the reflexes and therefore becomes the 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.630
 little brain called it 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.910
 nervous system or directly connected to the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 brain and nervous system 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.860
 responsible for that 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 body functions such as breathing 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.370
 heartbeat 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.410
 organs temperature drinking balance 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 in short all the basic function that the body 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.060
 needs to be able to live them 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.570
 the to volunteer a reflexes and the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.410
 vital functions is in this small brain 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.430
 and here is also the instinct behavior 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.160
 the cerebellum 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.380
 is the oldest part of the brain of 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.040
 the smell has always been there 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.900
 center odor was always very important 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.490
 and smell is the part that determines what 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.670
 you feel 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.620
 fragrance always tells the truth 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.330
 horses still use their scent 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.070
 very intensive 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.210
 among other things because of the emotion of the others 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.950
 to smell they have a highly developed 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.260
 nose 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.480
 the hairs protruding from the nose 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.620
 his nerves 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.200
 so they can smell and feel 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.990
 at the same time they need it 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.570
 horses have three ways of smelling 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.570
 far away and very close to one 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.010
 like flame afar they need to 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.980
 to smell water 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.290
 they can but they have their scent 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.360
 also needed to look and smell 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.290
 so determine their own behavior and that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.290
 change in estimate 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.200
 the next part of the brain is it 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:02.800
 big brain the big circle is also called 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 the crm or the mammalian brain 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.690
 the neocortex surrounds it 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.900
 that is the part where thinking is in 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.940
 the learning comes from and it comes to mind 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.110
 we learn the horses needed to be able to 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.760
 Operate 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:22.490
 as a herd animal the deeper the grooves of 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.490
 the brains are the more intelligent 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.890
 the owner is so that an animal can 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.390
 acting and earth are high , for example 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.050
 socially skilled 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.760
 so also need many lessons 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.160
 so the brain is the cockpit of it 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.960
 life 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.570
 what I found special about horses is that 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.030
 they can learn so much and 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.920
 that the brain 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.960
 basic brain of all of us precisely 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.180
 is the same 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.420
 no matter what you are it goes 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.200
 only one is more developed 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.200
 then with the other 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.010
 each side of the brains see the 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.119
 have special talents people 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.729
 for example the speech 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.919
 true that people are not too 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.809
 but been able to of all 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.719
 animal species only 14 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:14.129
 large animal species to domestication One 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.279
 of the reasons for that being possible 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:20.099
 because these animals are all 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:21.809
 enter into high social skills 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:24.709
 so in a specific way with each other 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.709
 read together
