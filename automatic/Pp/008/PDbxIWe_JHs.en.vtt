00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.200 
both ends until it stretches do you see
that<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:41.530> then<00:01:42.530> you're<00:01:42.830> going<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.210> simply

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
that and then you're going to simply

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.660 
that and then you're going to simply
roll<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.350> that's<00:01:46.010> how<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.190> would<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.550> it

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
roll it and that's how you would do it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.180 
roll it and that's how you would do it
on<00:01:46.820> your<00:01:47.000> nail<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.360> well<00:01:47.540> pinch<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.650> ends

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
on your nail as well pinch the ends

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.790 
on your nail as well pinch the ends
until<00:01:50.120> it<00:01:50.540> stretches<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.229> then<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.620> would

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
until it stretches and then you would

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.610 
until it stretches and then you would
simply<00:01:52.010> just<00:01:52.250> rolling<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.390> your<00:01:53.570> nails<00:01:53.840> and

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
simply just rolling on to your nails and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.030 
simply just rolling on to your nails and
as<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:55.580> see<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:56.720> image<00:01:57.020> came<00:01:57.440> out<00:01:57.620> much

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
as you can see the image came out much

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.760 
as you can see the image came out much
larger<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:58.729> going<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.090> stamp<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.540> now

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
larger and I'm going to stamp it now

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670 
larger and I'm going to stamp it now
just<00:02:00.910> with<00:02:01.910> its<00:02:02.150> normal<00:02:02.780> size<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.290> pres

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
just with its normal size so that pres

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.820 
just with its normal size so that pres
can<00:02:03.920> see<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.250> difference

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.650 

so<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> two<00:02:11.730> images<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so there you have the two images and you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.290 
so there you have the two images and you
can<00:02:12.840> see<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.590> larger<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> other

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
can see one is larger and then the other

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.860 
can see one is larger and then the other
one<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.750> much<00:02:16.530> much<00:02:16.920> smaller<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.630> does

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
one is much much smaller and this does

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.809 
one is much much smaller and this does
take<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.530> practice<00:02:19.819> don't

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
take a little bit of practice don't

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.760 
take a little bit of practice don't
worry<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.450> guys<00:02:21.660> will<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.200> down<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
worry you guys will get this down it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.199 
worry you guys will get this down it
took<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> little<00:02:23.340> while<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.760> figure<00:02:23.910> this

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
took me a little while to figure this

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.970 
took me a little while to figure this
out<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.720> sometimes<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> have<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
out and sometimes you know you have to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.520 
out and sometimes you know you have to
change<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.430> nail<00:02:26.640> polish<00:02:27.000> colors<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.200> see

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
which one works not all blacks are made

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.930 
which one works not all blacks are made
not<00:02:31.620> all<00:02:31.740> black<00:02:31.950> polishes<00:02:32.370> are<00:02:32.520> made<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.760> same

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
not all black polishes are made the same

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.630 
not all black polishes are made the same
some<00:02:33.209> are<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.390> little<00:02:33.480> bit<00:02:33.690> more<00:02:34.640> pigmented

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
some are a little bit more pigmented

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.310 
some are a little bit more pigmented
than<00:02:35.820> others<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.050> have<00:02:37.200> to

remove it from there

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.589 
remove it from there
stamp<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.810> order<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.320> stretch<00:02:59.280> it

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
stamp in order and stretch it

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.229 
stamp in order and stretch it
and<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.439> would<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.799> simply<00:03:02.999> roll<00:03:03.999> it

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
and then you would just simply roll it

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.190 
and then you would just simply roll it
onto<00:03:04.659> your<00:03:04.989> knee<00:03:05.739> I'm<00:03:06.519> gonna<00:03:06.730> try<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.540> my

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200

onto your knee I'm gonna try this on my
nails<00:03:08.409> so<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.680> guys<00:03:08.829> can<00:03:09.069> see<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.519> difference

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
nails so you guys can see the difference

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.979 
nails so you guys can see the difference
I'm<00:03:10.900> gonna<00:03:11.049> stamp<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.680> image<00:03:12.129> onto<00:03:12.989> this

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
I'm gonna stamp the image onto this

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.199 
I'm gonna stamp the image onto this
finger<00:03:14.499> just<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.950> way<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
finger just the way it is on the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.110 
finger just the way it is on the
stamping<00:03:17.129> plate<00:03:18.129> and<00:03:18.609> that's<00:03:18.730> what<00:03:18.879> it<00:03:19.090> looks

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
stamping plate and that's what it looks

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.509 
stamping plate and that's what it looks
like<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.719> it<00:03:19.840> turned<00:03:20.109> out<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:20.500> nicely<00:03:21.280> but

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
like and it turned out really nicely but

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.610 
like and it turned out really nicely but
that<00:03:21.670> again<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.329> said<00:03:22.540> my<00:03:22.689> nails<00:03:22.930> we're

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that again like I said my nails we're

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.640 
that again like I said my nails we're
not<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:23.980> wide<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:24.849> very<00:03:25.120> long<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.590> I'm

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
not very wide and not very long so I'm

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.490 
not very wide and not very long so I'm
gonna<00:03:26.799> try<00:03:27.099> this<00:03:27.159> again<00:03:27.639> on<00:03:28.629> my<00:03:28.959> thumbnail

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
gonna try this again on my thumbnail

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500 
gonna try this again on my thumbnail
because<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.129> thumbnail<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.790> usually<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.329> one

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
because the thumbnail is usually the one

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.360 
because the thumbnail is usually the one
that's<00:03:31.769> wider<00:03:33.480> pick<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:34.629> your<00:03:34.780> image<00:03:38.370> stretch

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
that's wider pick up your image stretch

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.360 
that's wider pick up your image stretch
it<00:03:39.609> out<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:41.319> roll<00:03:41.949> it<00:03:42.129> onto<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.819> nail<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.889> as

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
it out and roll it onto the nail and as

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.909 
it out and roll it onto the nail and as
you<00:03:45.489> can<00:03:45.639> see<00:03:45.699> much<00:03:46.269> better

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.409 

now<00:03:50.919> like<00:03:51.159> I<00:03:51.280> said<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.669> takes<00:03:51.969> some<00:03:52.209> practice

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
now like I said it takes some practice

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.909 
now like I said it takes some practice
you<00:03:52.750> guys<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:53.019> want<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.260> get<00:03:53.379> it<00:03:53.530> right<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
you guys you want to get it right the

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.429 
you guys you want to get it right the
first<00:03:53.949> time<00:03:54.219> I<00:03:54.579> sure<00:03:55.269> don't<00:03:55.480> get<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.959> right<00:03:56.109> all

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
first time I sure don't get it right all

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.599 
first time I sure don't get it right all
the<00:03:56.650> time<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:58.120> does<00:03:58.510> help<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.349> lot<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.859> pinch

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
the time but it does help a lot to pinch

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.360 
the time but it does help a lot to pinch
the<00:04:00.939> edges<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.510> stretch<00:04:01.870> out<00:04:02.169> the<00:04:02.199> image<00:04:02.739> next

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
the edges to stretch out the image next

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.159 
the edges to stretch out the image next

now<00:04:09.669> I'm<00:04:09.790> gonna<00:04:09.939> use<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.359> born<00:04:10.689> pretty<00:04:11.040> plate

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
now I'm gonna use this born pretty plate

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.009 
now I'm gonna use this born pretty plate
number<00:04:12.549> four<00:04:12.909> and<00:04:13.209> I'm<00:04:13.299> gonna<00:04:13.479> show<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.810> how

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.259 
number four and I'm gonna show you how
to<00:04:14.079> shrink<00:04:14.439> an<00:04:14.650> image<00:04:14.919> now<00:04:15.069> obviously<00:04:15.459> this<00:04:16.030> is

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
to shrink an image now obviously this is

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.029 
to shrink an image now obviously this is
really<00:04:16.570> too<00:04:16.780> big<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.139> fit<00:04:17.320> on<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:17.859> know

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
really too big to fit on and you know

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.680 
really too big to fit on and you know
unless<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.519> have<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.639> super<00:04:19.030> duper<00:04:19.120> long<00:04:19.449> nail

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
unless you have a super duper long nail

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.149 
unless you have a super duper long nail
and<00:04:19.930> then<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.169> would<00:04:20.320> still<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.889> do<00:04:21.009> it

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
and then you would still have to do it

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.260 
and then you would still have to do it
in<00:04:21.280> two<00:04:21.669> stages

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
in two stages

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
did not shrink the image and as you can

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.490 
did not shrink the image and as you can
see<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.699> huge<00:05:14.120> difference<00:05:14.810> right<00:05:14.930> there

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.750 

between<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.710> two<00:05:18.979> images<00:05:21.039> but<00:05:22.039> you<00:05:22.460> get<00:05:22.639> the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
between the two images but you get the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.390 
between the two images but you get the
idea<00:05:22.789> I<00:05:23.449> hope<00:05:24.050> this<00:05:24.260> has<00:05:24.470> been<00:05:24.500> helpful<00:05:24.650> again
