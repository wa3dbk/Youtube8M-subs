 Reproduction the goaties in the start 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.049
 high answers are also the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.989
 neither the federal government alone nor the federal states will get Marc Chagall without me

 Macaroni are such a kind of ticker only in Dornbirn 1 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.739
 this circumstance they have to exploit for themselves to work into the song that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.479
 money 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.659

 but they have only seen in one good 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.900
 never 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.760
 As far as I know, they are quite good at macaroni 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.629
 think 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.689

 next to yes but why and all the world ledger Caroline was the job who 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:46.329
 It does not make any sense at all to two goalies I will never 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.329
 that can also be done via the or 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.939

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.999
 he cooks for this pony 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.899
 he cooks his pony 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.689

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.749
 the city of June Ghana then to the point 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.959
 achieved 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 outstanding was november 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.129
 we have 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
