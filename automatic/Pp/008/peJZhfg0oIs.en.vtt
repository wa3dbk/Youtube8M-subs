00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and obviously in 10 if the quiet blog 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.940
 of rivero dad is the operation I think 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.589
 that was working 3 to know how 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.059
 is the team face what in cup 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 liberators of america because this 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.349
 basically they are matches coming out of the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.089
 preseason you can get 4 can you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.010
 put great action on our breasts 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.779
 reprimand remember that last year role 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.220
 and party was the winner of this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.350
 quadrangular as it was in the cup 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
 liberators of America was eliminated the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.970
 first in the group stage that came out 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 eliminated the fact of winning not you 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359
 guarantee you have a good cup 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 liberators for me the most important thing 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.059
 is the operation is how are the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.590
 lines as they are coupled 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.420
 players because this is a new 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.850
 process to sport the stand is fine 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.290
 but let's see tell me in what part of glass 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 it has worked and you do not give it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 importance to the result and to that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.370
 importance to the operation of that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 running on to which you liked 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 well what we are all addressing is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 that the crystal shows better 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.789
 defensively that last year because 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 the previous season generated great 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.329
 doubts because the crystal was a thing of the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 half forward and one half 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.020
 backwards they were not hideous defenses 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.699
 central but it's a problem not only of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.110
 crystal is a problem of the selection 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.250
 it's a water problem is a problem 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.440
 of the alliance 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 that something was corrected with ibáñez is a 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 problem of almost all equipment 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.740
 Peruvians we have rejection is and there 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.660
 people who keep asking rejectionist is 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.910
 that sends a rejected narain was 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.950
 talking about rejector is one of the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.020
 goals that you do not like, I think 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.150
 ojeriza was there is not there have 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 hired to the wine they put 3 to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.440
 crystal that is the reality they thrashed it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 to the crystal but I what is going today 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.700
 to work that defensive part if 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 you have a link you have to youtube goals 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 of selection you have Álvarez with a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.580
 experience has is to open the important 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.259
 it's going to be how they cohere 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.200
 defensively they are going to make mistakes 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.970
 it's true but maybe we do not have 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.890
 a lot of space for the comment because 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 the images a little we have had 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 difficulties to appreciate it but of what 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 that we have been able 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 suddenly listen on the subject of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.080
 Transmissions is that this is for you 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.149
 list has the few situations of goal 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.450
 there if my concern comes because 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.789
 we talk about players like this one ávila 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.050
 for example players like maybe 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.270
 elements that could be generated 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.560
 imbalance however crystal generated 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 little in terms of attack 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.830
 that to me particularly worries me 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.270
 because the first match 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 better local and what you have to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.580
 do you have to propose ricardo cristal
