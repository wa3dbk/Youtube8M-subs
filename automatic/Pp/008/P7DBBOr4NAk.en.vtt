00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.649 

you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.650> add<00:01:49.860> your<00:01:50.159> screen<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:51.000> subtract

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you can add your screen or subtract

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.710 
you can add your screen or subtract
green<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> same<00:01:57.450> with

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
green if you want to and the same with

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.789 
green if you want to and the same with
blue<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.590> best<00:02:01.860> though<00:02:02.070> seems<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:03.799> using

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
blue the best though seems to be using

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.170 
blue the best though seems to be using
all<00:02:04.890> three<00:02:05.159> colors<00:02:08.090> gives<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> nice<00:02:09.420> look

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.399 

one<00:02:13.170> other<00:02:13.349> way<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.830> making<00:02:14.129> adjustments<00:02:15.409> and

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
one other way of making adjustments and

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.009 
one other way of making adjustments and
you<00:02:16.799> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.370> experiment<00:02:17.790> use<00:02:18.269> them<00:02:18.450> within<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
you have to experiment use them within a

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.720 
you have to experiment use them within a
combination<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.159> two<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.670> that's

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
combination of the two and that's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.869 
combination of the two and that's
changing<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.390> hue/saturation<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.519> on<00:02:24.230> ya

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
changing the hue/saturation and so on ya

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.190 
changing the hue/saturation and so on ya
see<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:26.909> lightens<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> up<00:02:27.569> makes<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.989> little

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
see it lightens it up makes a little

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.850 
see it lightens it up makes a little
redder<00:02:29.510> some<00:02:30.510> things<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.170> can't<00:02:31.409> adjust<00:02:31.680> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
redder some things you can't adjust it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
redder some things you can't adjust it
very<00:02:32.099> much<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.049> saturation<00:02:38.930> it's<00:02:39.930> got<00:02:40.140> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
very much this is saturation it's got a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:51.770 
very much this is saturation it's got a
nice<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:43.579> lightness<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.819> darkness<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.569> this

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
nice and lightness and darkness so this

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
nice and lightness and darkness so this
gives<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.170> new<00:02:52.349> tool<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.980> play<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.430> this
