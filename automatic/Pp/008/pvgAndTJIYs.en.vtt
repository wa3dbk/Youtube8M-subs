00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 the greatest difficulty in glazing 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.319
 moderns will become represent 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
 windows which have adjacent fields 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.240
 angled to each other so 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.370
 called 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.459
 on the construction because the cold air 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.529
 has access from both sides on the field 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.689
 cold temperatures shift inward 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.130
 premises which may lead to 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.680
 condensation 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.140
 and if the temperature drops below -40 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.820
 degrees celsius i.e. in education 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 money to protector 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.019
 rooms avoid unpleasant phenomena 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.600
 standard three-chamber features 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.940
 profile system may be 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.339
 insufficient and in size and opera 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.210
 Profiles are so large to handle 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.129
 with this task 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 if it comes to residential heated 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.769
 better rooms to give preference 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.500
 modern 5 or 6 chamber profile 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.809
 systems massive bay windows 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.809
 which easily cope with this problem 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 we cannot prevent the field from shifting 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.970
 cold temperatures inside the room 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 but thanks to a special thickening 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.190
 between adjacent windows is critical and for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 us zone remains inside the window 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.760
 designs and does not go on her 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 the surface so we won't 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.270
 watch not a capacitor and even more so 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.270
 education on 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.140
 there are bay windows for angle 90 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 degrees 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 135 degrees and for arbitrary angles 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.950
 the main thing that the angle between the windows was not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.200
 too sharp otherwise 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 provide two isolated 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 constructions if windows should 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.100
 open the angle between them cannot 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.550
 be less than 90 degrees otherwise sash 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.720
 will not function fully if 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.140
 it's about glazing 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.530
 unheated rooms balcony veranda 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 or loggias for example, it will be enough 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.370
 standard three-chamber profile 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.060
 systems since 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.340
 temperature and humidity balance of such 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.610
 The premises are different from heated 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.530
 that problem with condensation 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.050
 are unlikely to have the same meaning and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.600
 even if it appears we can with 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.400
 ease to air a balcony for heating 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.400
 whose money we did not spend
