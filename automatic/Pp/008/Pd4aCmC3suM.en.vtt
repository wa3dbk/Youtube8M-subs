resistance
so<00:00:11.960> with<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> new<00:00:13.200> fractals<00:00:13.740> agony

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
so with the new fractals agony

so with the new fractals agony
resistance<00:00:15.000> infusions<00:00:15.599> drop<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.130> boss

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
resistance infusions drop in the boss

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.000 
resistance infusions drop in the boss
chest<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.840> higher<00:00:19.109> your<00:00:19.320> fractal<00:00:19.740> level

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
chest now the higher your fractal level

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.090 
chest now the higher your fractal level
the<00:00:20.520> more<00:00:20.789> agony<00:00:21.750> resists<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.890> those

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the more agony resists you get on those

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.900 
the more agony resists you get on those
infusions<00:00:23.820> if<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.150> look<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.869> Trading<00:00:25.680> Post

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
infusions if we look at the Trading Post

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.120 
infusions if we look at the Trading Post
we<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:28.609> fusion<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> highest

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we can see in fusion the highest

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
we can see in fusion the highest
currently<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.880> +10<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.649> no<00:00:34.890> idea<00:00:35.280> what

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
currently is +10 now I have no idea what

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
currently is +10 now I have no idea what
drops<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.450> no<00:00:36.719> idea<00:00:36.750> how<00:00:37.260> high<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
drops and I have no idea how high you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
drops and I have no idea how high you
can<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:37.890> craft<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.290> have

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
can actually craft these but if you have

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.569 
can actually craft these but if you have
an<00:00:40.770> artificer<00:00:41.370> which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.180> 100<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.930> higher

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
an artificer which is of 100 or higher

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
an artificer which is of 100 or higher
you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:45.000> craft<00:00:45.719> yourselves<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you can actually craft yourselves if we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.340 
you can actually craft yourselves if we
get<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.670> down<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:50.660> down<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.840> upgrade

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
get them down here down in upgrade

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.270 
get them down here down in upgrade
components<00:00:53.870> now<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> discover

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
components now you need to discover

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
components now you need to discover
these<00:00:56.460> yourself<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.059> basically<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.170> at

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
these yourself but basically it works at

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.290 
these yourself but basically it works at
a<00:00:58.649> power<00:00:59.010> too<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.789> +2<00:01:02.789> agony

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a power too so to get a +2 agony

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.460 
a power too so to get a +2 agony
infusion<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.960> require<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.840> +1<00:01:06.840> agony

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
infusion you require to +1 agony

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
infusion you require to +1 agony
infusions<00:01:08.450> okay<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:11.729> build<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.210> up

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
infusions okay now to build these up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.890 
infusions okay now to build these up
from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> start<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.159> example<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.450> we

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
from the start the best example is as we

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
from the start the best example is as we
go<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.130> +3<00:01:18.030> agony<00:01:18.840> infusion<00:01:19.729> will

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
go we go down a +3 agony infusion will

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
go we go down a +3 agony infusion will
require<00:01:21.710> 2<00:01:22.710> plus<00:01:23.070> 2's<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.720> remember<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
require 2 plus 2's now remember that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.700 
require 2 plus 2's now remember that
each<00:01:25.530> +2<00:01:26.189> requires<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.270> 2<00:01:27.720> Plus<00:01:28.140> Ones

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
each +2 requires a 2 Plus Ones

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
each +2 requires a 2 Plus Ones
so<00:01:29.040> 4<00:01:29.400> plus<00:01:29.430> ones<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:31.170> plus<00:01:31.590> 3<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> me

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so 4 plus ones is a plus 3 you with me

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.490 
so 4 plus ones is a plus 3 you with me
now<00:01:34.759> as<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.329> down<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.020> obviously

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now as we go down this obviously

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
now as we go down this obviously
continually<00:01:38.400> doubles<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.600> 8<00:01:40.560> Omega<00:01:41.250> plus<00:01:41.549> 4<00:01:41.820> 16

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
continually doubles so 8 Omega plus 4 16

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
continually doubles so 8 Omega plus 4 16
will<00:01:42.689> make<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:43.020> plus<00:01:43.170> 5<00:01:43.439> 32<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.420> plus

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
will make up plus 5 32 will make up plus

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.100 
will make up plus 5 32 will make up plus
6<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.220> 64<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> plus<00:01:47.939> 7<00:01:48.570> plus<00:01:48.720> 7<00:01:48.899> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
6 and 64 will make a plus 7 plus 7 is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590 
6 and 64 will make a plus 7 plus 7 is
the<00:01:49.229> highest<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.009> got<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.430> far<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.479> I've

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the highest that I got this far so I've

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.469 
the highest that I got this far so I've
got<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> plus<00:01:52.079> 4<00:01:52.350> plus<00:01:52.619> 7<00:01:52.860> plus<00:01:53.130> 3<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.000> plus<00:01:54.119> 6

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
got a plus 4 plus 7 plus 3 and a plus 6

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.399 
got a plus 4 plus 7 plus 3 and a plus 6
in<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.960> bags<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> why<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
in my bags this is why this is kind of

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
in my bags this is why this is kind of
the<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.310> reason<00:01:59.670> why<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.420> last<00:02:00.630> few<00:02:00.780> videos

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the the reason why the last few videos

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.630 
the the reason why the last few videos
you've<00:02:01.200> seen<00:02:01.409> me<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.710> practically<00:02:02.250> no<00:02:02.399> gold

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you've seen me with practically no gold

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
you've seen me with practically no gold
because<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> had<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.170> some<00:02:04.350> fun<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
because I had to have some fun with it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
because I had to have some fun with it
so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.189> bought<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.700> stupid<00:02:06.540> amount<00:02:06.659> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so I just bought up a stupid amount of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.160 
so I just bought up a stupid amount of
plus<00:02:07.110> ones<00:02:07.550> but

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
plus ones but

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.640 
plus ones but
it's<00:02:10.170> actually<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.550> bad<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.330> mean<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.440> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's actually not that bad I mean if I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.230 
it's actually not that bad I mean if I
could<00:02:13.860> sell<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.100> for<00:02:14.430> 28<00:02:14.880> gold

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
could sell that for 28 gold

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.300 
could sell that for 28 gold
I<00:02:15.330> probably<00:02:15.660> made<00:02:15.990> most<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.800> my<00:02:16.920> money<00:02:17.100> back

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I probably made most of my money back

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
I probably made most of my money back
and<00:02:18.860> I've<00:02:19.860> still<00:02:20.070> got<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> other<00:02:20.840> infusions

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and I've still got the other infusions

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.890 
and I've still got the other infusions
to<00:02:22.020> spare<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.790> interesting<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.690> how

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
to spare it's interesting to see how

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.830 
to spare it's interesting to see how
this<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.500> develop<00:02:25.680> simply<00:02:26.430> because

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this is going to develop simply because

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
this is going to develop simply because
you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.080> build<00:02:28.320> them<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.890> way<00:02:29.160> from

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
you can build them up all the way from

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
you can build them up all the way from
plus<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.060> mean<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.870> enough<00:02:31.080> plus

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
plus one I mean if you have enough plus

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
plus one I mean if you have enough plus
ones<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.740> buy<00:02:31.920> enough<00:02:32.190> plus<00:02:32.370> ones<00:02:32.580> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
ones and you buy enough plus ones you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
ones and you buy enough plus ones you
can<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.600> make<00:02:33.630> yourself<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.440> full<00:02:34.710> set<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
can you can make yourself a full set of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.980 
can you can make yourself a full set of
plus<00:02:35.220> tems<00:02:35.490> already<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:38.150> actually<00:02:39.150> don't<00:02:39.540> know

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
plus tems already I actually don't know

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.720 
plus tems already I actually don't know
how<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.440> feel<00:02:40.740> about<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.220> I'll<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.520> honest

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
how I feel about that I'll be honest

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.260 
how I feel about that I'll be honest
because<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.830> mean<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.850> people<00:02:45.120> who

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
because I mean it's for the people who

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.730 
because I mean it's for the people who
have<00:02:45.390> got<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.660> money<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.990> spend<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
have got the money to spend on it and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.240 
have got the money to spend on it and
have<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.280> available<00:02:48.200> artificer<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:50.070> can

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
have the available artificer you can

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.690 
have the available artificer you can
just<00:02:50.460> happily<00:02:50.940> throw<00:02:51.800> plus<00:02:52.800> tens<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.490> your

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
just happily throw plus tens at your

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.830 
just happily throw plus tens at your
gear<00:02:53.940> more<00:02:54.870> or<00:02:54.960> less<00:02:55.080> instantly<00:02:56.750> which<00:02:57.750> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
gear more or less instantly which is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
gear more or less instantly which is
kind<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.200> crazy<00:02:59.960> although<00:03:04.670> interestingly

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
kind of crazy although interestingly

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.200 
kind of crazy although interestingly
enough<00:03:06.650> these<00:03:07.650> rings<00:03:09.230> are<00:03:10.730> infused<00:03:11.730> but<00:03:12.030> only

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
enough these rings are infused but only

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.000 
enough these rings are infused but only
give<00:03:12.480> me<00:03:12.600> plus<00:03:12.840> five<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:15.500> wonder<00:03:16.500> if<00:03:16.740> they're

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
give me plus five I wonder if they're

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.120 
give me plus five I wonder if they're
missing<00:03:17.190> an<00:03:17.760> infusion<00:03:18.740> but<00:03:19.740> I'm<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.070> to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
missing an infusion but I'm not going to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.440 
missing an infusion but I'm not going to
use<00:03:20.250> any<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.520> these<00:03:20.670> because<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.120> are<00:03:21.240> rather

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
use any of these because they are rather

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.760 
use any of these because they are rather
expensive<00:03:21.770> but<00:03:22.910> just<00:03:23.910> notice<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:25.500> in

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
expensive but just notice that so in

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.620 
expensive but just notice that so in
case<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.040> are<00:03:26.070> wondering<00:03:26.190> how<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.000> learn

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
case you are wondering how you learn

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.540 
case you are wondering how you learn
these<00:03:27.810> recipes<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.770> do<00:03:28.920> need<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.190> find<00:03:29.370> them

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
these recipes you do need to find them

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.580 
these recipes you do need to find them
out<00:03:29.640> yourself<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:31.080> you'll<00:03:31.200> need<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.440> do

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
out yourself so what you'll need to do

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.850 
out yourself so what you'll need to do
is<00:03:31.800> use<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.460> agony<00:03:33.030> infusion<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.020> you'll

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
is use the agony infusion and you'll

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.360 
is use the agony infusion and you'll
also<00:03:35.010> need<00:03:35.340> two<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.850> these<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.800> then<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:38.190> need

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
also need two of these and then you need

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.370 
also need two of these and then you need
a<00:03:38.400> thermal<00:03:38.880> catalytic<00:03:39.510> reagent<00:03:40.080> as<00:03:40.200> well

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
a thermal catalytic reagent as well

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.890 
a thermal catalytic reagent as well
these<00:03:40.800> are<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.160> ascended<00:03:41.660> reagent<00:03:42.660> they're

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
these are the ascended reagent they're

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.030 
these are the ascended reagent they're
bought<00:03:43.170> from<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:44.630> trade<00:03:45.630> skill<00:03:45.959> vendors<00:03:46.380> so

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
bought from the trade skill vendors so

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.590 
bought from the trade skill vendors so
been<00:03:47.430> mined<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.820> these<00:03:48.000> are<00:03:48.180> going<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.450> cost

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
been mined that these are going to cost

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.740 
been mined that these are going to cost
you<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:49.020> silver<00:03:49.470> forty<00:03:49.890> each<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.360> want<00:03:51.600> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you one silver forty each so you want to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.410 
you one silver forty each so you want to
kind<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.890> you're<00:03:53.400> calculating<00:03:53.640> things<00:03:54.209> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
kind of if you're calculating things to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.670 
kind of if you're calculating things to
make<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.600> profit<00:03:54.870> you'll<00:03:55.170> need<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.470> include

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
make a profit you'll need to include

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.830 
make a profit you'll need to include
that<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> all<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
that in all of the all of the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
that in all of the all of the
conversions<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.550> this<00:03:59.700> recipe

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
conversions so you can do this recipe

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.820 
conversions so you can do this recipe
with<00:04:00.480> every<00:04:00.930> single<00:04:01.080> one<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.620> how<00:04:01.770> you

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
with every single one this is how you

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.320 
with every single one this is how you
need<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.490> put<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> plus<00:04:02.880> one<00:04:03.120> and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
need to do it so you put a plus one and

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.790 
need to do it so you put a plus one and
the<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.930> catalytic<00:04:04.500> into<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.600> discovery

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
the the catalytic into the discovery

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
the the catalytic into the discovery
make<00:04:07.800> those<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.340> then<00:04:08.459> when<00:04:08.550> you<00:04:08.640> get<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
make those and then when you get the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.340 
make those and then when you get the
plus<00:04:08.970> twos<00:04:09.209> you'll<00:04:09.420> have<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.630> discover<00:04:09.959> plus

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
plus twos you'll have to discover plus

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.100 
plus twos you'll have to discover plus
two<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.860> then<00:04:11.130> plus<00:04:11.160> three<00:04:11.520> etc<00:04:11.670> etc<00:04:12.030> etc<00:04:12.330> so

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
two and then plus three etc etc etc so

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.180 
two and then plus three etc etc etc so
you<00:04:13.170> actually<00:04:13.320> need<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.590> discover<00:04:13.920> all<00:04:14.160> of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you actually need to discover all of

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.559 
you actually need to discover all of
these

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
these

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.599 
these
but<00:04:15.989> that's<00:04:16.139> how<00:04:16.289> you<00:04:16.320> do<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.739> with<00:04:16.949> your<00:04:17.220> utter

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
but that's how you do it with your utter

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.990 
but that's how you do it with your utter
fighting<00:04:18.120> now<00:04:19.669> obviously<00:04:20.669> if<00:04:20.759> you<00:04:20.820> want<00:04:20.940> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
fighting now obviously if you want to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.550 
fighting now obviously if you want to
skip<00:04:21.180> all<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.600> you've<00:04:21.840> kind<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.259> you've

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
skip all that and you've kind of you've

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.879 
skip all that and you've kind of you've
got<00:04:22.740> enough<00:04:22.979> money<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.370> do<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.060> just

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
got enough money to do so you can just

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.140 
got enough money to do so you can just
buy<00:04:25.889> them<00:04:26.070> off<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.220> Trading<00:04:26.610> Post<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.940> mean

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
buy them off the Trading Post I mean

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.219 
buy them off the Trading Post I mean
some<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.539> them<00:04:27.630> are<00:04:27.780> kind<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.050> ludicrous

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
some of them are kind of ludicrous

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.550 
some of them are kind of ludicrous
prices<00:04:28.860> right<00:04:28.979> now<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.449> I<00:04:30.509> say<00:04:30.750> if<00:04:31.380> you

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
prices right now but as I say if you

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.110 
prices right now but as I say if you
have<00:04:32.300> an<00:04:33.300> artificer<00:04:33.750> for<00:04:34.050> example<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:35.669> can

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
have an artificer for example you can

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.360 
have an artificer for example you can
clearly<00:04:36.479> see<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.780> two<00:04:37.410> plus<00:04:37.650> one<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:38.220> cheaper

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
clearly see that two plus one is cheaper

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.499 
clearly see that two plus one is cheaper
than<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.669> plus<00:04:38.850> 2<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.800> 4<00:04:40.800> plus<00:04:41.639> wagons<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.210> still

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
than a plus 2 and 4 plus wagons is still

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.260 
than a plus 2 and 4 plus wagons is still
cheaper<00:04:42.870> than<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.110> plus<00:04:43.289> 3<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:45.030> kind<00:04:45.210> of

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
cheaper than a plus 3 and it kind of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.480 
cheaper than a plus 3 and it kind of
gets<00:04:45.389> crazy<00:04:45.720> from<00:04:45.930> there<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.289> mean<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.979> jumps<00:04:47.370> up

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
gets crazy from there I mean it jumps up

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.020 
gets crazy from there I mean it jumps up
more<00:04:48.419> than<00:04:48.570> twice<00:04:48.780> here<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:49.380> then<00:04:50.340> there's<00:04:50.940> a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
more than twice here and then there's a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.430 
more than twice here and then there's a
little<00:04:51.180> bit<00:04:51.360> of<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.539> strange<00:04:51.870> jump<00:04:52.199> there

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
little bit of a strange jump there

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.850 
little bit of a strange jump there
nearly<00:04:53.220> twice<00:04:53.639> going<00:04:54.030> up<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.240> plus<00:04:54.449> six<00:04:54.750> then<00:04:55.410> a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
nearly twice going up to plus six then a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.939 
nearly twice going up to plus six then a
crazy<00:04:56.160> jump<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.729> plus<00:04:56.970> seven<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.720> crazy<00:04:58.410> jump<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
crazy jump to plus seven a crazy jump to

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.450 
crazy jump to plus seven a crazy jump to
plus<00:04:59.310> eight<00:04:59.550> a<00:05:00.419> relatively<00:05:01.320> insane<00:05:01.710> jump<00:05:02.039> to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
plus eight a relatively insane jump to

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.999 
plus eight a relatively insane jump to
plus<00:05:02.820> nine<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.419> then<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:04.020> got<00:05:04.259> just<00:05:04.889> over

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
plus nine and then you got just over

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.499 
plus nine and then you got just over
double<00:05:05.370> again<00:05:05.610> for<00:05:05.849> a<00:05:05.880> plus<00:05:06.090> ten

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
double again for a plus ten

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.320 
double again for a plus ten
so<00:05:07.380> there<00:05:08.160> may<00:05:08.370> be<00:05:08.400> money<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.000> be<00:05:09.120> made<00:05:09.270> here

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
so there may be money to be made here

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.629 
so there may be money to be made here
you<00:05:10.020> never<00:05:10.229> know<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.860> never<00:05:10.979> know<00:05:11.130> I'm<00:05:11.430> sure

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
you never know you never know I'm sure

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.610 
you never know you never know I'm sure
someone<00:05:11.970> will<00:05:12.120> run<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.419> math<00:05:12.599> on<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.050> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
someone will run the math on it and I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.140 
someone will run the math on it and I
kind<00:05:13.979> of<00:05:14.039> already<00:05:14.220> did<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:14.729> it<00:05:14.849> was<00:05:15.000> very

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
kind of already did and it was very

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.490 
kind of already did and it was very
profitable<00:05:15.419> right<00:05:15.900> at<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.110> start<00:05:16.380> because

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
profitable right at the start because

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.930 
profitable right at the start because
people<00:05:16.889> were<00:05:16.949> being<00:05:17.130> silly<00:05:17.340> with<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.550> prices

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
people were being silly with the prices

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.750 
people were being silly with the prices
I<00:05:18.120> probably<00:05:18.780> made<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> few<00:05:19.530> gold<00:05:19.770> by<00:05:20.099> doing<00:05:20.550> it

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
I probably made a few gold by doing it

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.790 
I probably made a few gold by doing it
simply<00:05:21.570> because<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.960> bought<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.500> agony

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
simply because I bought the agony

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.409 
simply because I bought the agony
infusions<00:05:23.280> when<00:05:23.490> they<00:05:23.639> were<00:05:23.699> kind<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.060> flooded

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
infusions when they were kind of flooded

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.860
