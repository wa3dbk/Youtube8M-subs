different seasons they label it two

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.779 
different seasons they label it two
different<00:00:33.649> seasons<00:00:33.949> we<00:00:34.219> have<00:00:34.370> like<00:00:34.550> nine

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
different seasons we have like nine

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.169 
different seasons we have like nine
season<00:00:35.179> under<00:00:35.390> our<00:00:35.480> belt<00:00:35.690> at<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.079> point<00:00:37.179> but

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
season under our belt at this point but

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.759 
season under our belt at this point but
it's<00:00:38.300> great<00:00:38.449> I<00:00:38.750> love<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.019> I<00:00:39.230> think<00:00:39.469> I<00:00:39.559> think<00:00:39.739> I

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
it's great I love it I think I think I

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.799 
it's great I love it I think I think I
think<00:00:39.859> it's<00:00:40.070> good<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.280> think<00:00:40.339> we<00:00:40.550> can<00:00:40.699> kind<00:00:41.690> of

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
think it's good I think we can kind of

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.360 
think it's good I think we can kind of
condense<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.379> storyline<00:00:42.859> a<00:00:42.890> little<00:00:43.160> bit<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
condense the storyline a little bit so

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.910 
condense the storyline a little bit so
it<00:00:43.460> stretches<00:00:43.789> out<00:00:43.940> longer<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:44.809> it's<00:00:44.960> wait<00:00:45.739> I

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
it stretches out longer so it's wait I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.849 
it stretches out longer so it's wait I
just<00:00:46.100> did<00:00:46.429> I<00:00:46.489> just<00:00:46.699> contradict<00:00:47.690> myself<00:00:47.839> I<00:00:48.589> did

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
just did I just contradict myself I did

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.770 
just did I just contradict myself I did
I<00:00:49.190> think<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:49.910> better<00:00:50.030> because<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.660> could

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
I think it's better because we could

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.299 
I think it's better because we could
expand<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:51.289> can<00:00:51.410> expand<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.890> storyline

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
expand we can expand the storyline

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.340 
expand we can expand the storyline
stretch<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.179> out<00:00:53.269> so<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.260> know
