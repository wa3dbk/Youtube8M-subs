00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
Mayweather I think that's a little

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.880 
Mayweather I think that's a little
that's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.490> ridiculous<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.119> know

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that's a little ridiculous you know

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
people were saying the same thing when

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.179 
people were saying the same thing when
Castillo<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.689> Floyd<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.200> first<00:01:46.409> time<00:01:46.680> well

Castillo for Floyd the first time well
that's<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> blueprint<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> beat<00:01:48.149> Mayweather

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.149 
that's the blueprint to beat Mayweather
is<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> pressure<00:01:49.110> him<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> stuff

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is to pressure him and all that stuff

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
is to pressure him and all that stuff
you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.270> Ricky<00:01:51.540> had<00:01:51.689> tried<00:01:51.990> daddy

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you know and then Ricky had tried daddy

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.700 
you know and then Ricky had tried daddy
he<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.770> happened<00:01:53.159> him<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.710> think

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
he see what happened him so I think

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.999 
he see what happened him so I think
Oscar<00:01:56.750> there's<00:01:57.750> no<00:01:57.990> blueprint<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.590> beat<00:01:58.740> Floyd

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
Oscar there's no blueprint to beat Floyd

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.679 
Oscar there's no blueprint to beat Floyd
Mayweather<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.700> think<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.420> some

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
Mayweather I think that there are some

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.569 
Mayweather I think that there are some
ideas<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:01.920> we've<00:02:02.070> seen<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
ideas out there from what we've seen and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.380 
ideas out there from what we've seen and
delahoy<00:02:03.149> fight<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> Cotto<00:02:03.810> fight

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
delahoy fight the Cotto fight

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.230 
delahoy fight the Cotto fight
and<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.770> Casteel<00:02:07.160> fire<00:02:07.550> if<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:07.820> combine<00:02:08.210> all

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
and the Casteel fire if you combine all

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.200 
and the Casteel fire if you combine all
those<00:02:08.690> things<00:02:08.990> I<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:10.160> in<00:02:10.369> my<00:02:10.610> opinion<00:02:10.759> I

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
those things I think in my opinion I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.870 
those things I think in my opinion I
think<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.930> way<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:13.220> someone<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.550> beat

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
think that the way for someone to beat

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.210 
think that the way for someone to beat
Floyd<00:02:14.180> Mayweather<00:02:14.600> would<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.260> person<00:02:15.770> has

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
Floyd Mayweather would be a person has

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.740 
Floyd Mayweather would be a person has
to<00:02:16.520> establish<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.210> jab

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
to establish the jab

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
to establish the jab
I<00:02:17.780> think<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> delahoy<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.920> correct<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.370> that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
I think the delahoy is correct on that

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.890 
I think the delahoy is correct on that
you<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.390> establish<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.960> jab<00:02:22.450> kick<00:02:23.450> break

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you have to establish the jab kick break

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.090 
you have to establish the jab kick break
his<00:02:24.110> rhythm<00:02:24.470> with<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> jab

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
his rhythm with the jab

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.570 
his rhythm with the jab
okay<00:02:25.570> also<00:02:26.770> don't<00:02:27.770> be<00:02:27.860> afraid<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.220> get<00:02:28.340> hit

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
okay also don't be afraid to get hit

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.370 
okay also don't be afraid to get hit

alright don't wait on Floyd Mayweather

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.590 
alright don't wait on Floyd Mayweather

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
I hope that I don't see this with Canelo

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.610 
I hope that I don't see this with Canelo

million dollars to fight Floyd he's in

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.290 
million dollars to fight Floyd he's in
under<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:59.040> impression<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.550> every<00:06:00.060> fight

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
under the impression that every fight

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.240 
under the impression that every fight
now<00:06:00.600> but<00:06:01.140> he<00:06:01.260> thinks<00:06:01.560> he's<00:06:01.740> in<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.919> big<00:06:02.100> time

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
now but he thinks he's in the big time

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.010 
now but he thinks he's in the big time
now<00:06:02.310> so<00:06:02.700> he<00:06:02.790> thinks<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.060> every<00:06:03.570> fight<00:06:03.810> now

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
now so he thinks that every fight now

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.090 
now so he thinks that every fight now
it's<00:06:04.200> gonna<00:06:04.290> be<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.470> munching<00:06:04.800> may<00:06:04.919> another

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100

it's gonna be a munching may another
fight<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:06.090> that's<00:06:06.330> not<00:06:06.450> the<00:06:06.600> case<00:06:06.840> girls<00:06:07.500> so
