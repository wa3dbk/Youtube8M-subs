00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.980
 you hi all and welcome to this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
 new video so I introduce you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 a small strategy at the same time a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 double punishment a year we did with 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 karim this shot then we sent 1 origin 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.940
 so on call of duty black ops there 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 did a strategy called the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.289
 police attack the name it comes from 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.150
 doctors this crime that I was doing on 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.550
 gamer also know about youtube 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.769
 I had a lot of originality 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 of the staff called me the shepherd so the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 police attack it was invented by sex 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.579
 blinking is so this strategy 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 is simply camping in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.480
 the fastest spawn of the pond in 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 reminds that tears of origin is a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 ice stick that kills zombies at 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.190
 your closeness so this is the purpose of the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.510
 game it's simply found the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 fastest spawn to kill them the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.149
 As fast as possible 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.620
 you found this strategy esec a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.329
 found a little blah which was rather 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 not bad so we see it there it is at 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.379
 level of two panels that distort m 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.340
 so we did 45 round so at 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.770
 know that her strategy she is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.879
 really hard enough if you forget 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.309
 to shoot a ball from elsewhere it's this 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 what will happen if you miss a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 ball down to his party purposes you have 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 need napalm when you have them 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.909
 robots coming down from salt to panzers 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.020
 you lay down pale elena and deposits 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.549
