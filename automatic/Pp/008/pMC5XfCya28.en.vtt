00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
really good really good idea when you

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.310 
really good really good idea when you
move<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.270> more<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.050> add<00:03:21.290> a

move up a little more you can add a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.020 
move up a little more you can add a
pillion<00:03:21.680> or<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.130> can<00:03:22.250> add<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.370> rack<00:03:22.640> for<00:03:23.000> a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100

to look like they were made 50 years ago
I<00:03:34.310> think<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.120> thoroughly<00:03:35.690> modern<00:03:35.930> that

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
I think it's thoroughly modern that

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.310 
I think it's thoroughly modern that
