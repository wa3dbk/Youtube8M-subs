well I might be little but I'm really
really<00:04:11.620> fast<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.280> guess<00:04:12.550> what<00:04:12.790> now<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.240> is

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
bigger they are the harder they fall so

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.250 
bigger they are the harder they fall so
