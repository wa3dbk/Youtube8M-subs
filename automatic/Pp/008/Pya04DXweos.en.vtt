00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you will be able to do in this blue part

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.289 
you will be able to do in this blue part
you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.470> actually<00:02:07.710> slow<00:02:08.220> down<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.820> playback

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
you can actually slow down the playback

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.390 
you can actually slow down the playback
and<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.929> select<00:02:10.080> multiple<00:02:10.590> areas<00:02:11.070> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and you can select multiple areas that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.759 
and you can select multiple areas that
you<00:02:11.489> want<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> slow<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.650> you

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
you want to slow down and then if you

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.039 
you want to slow down and then if you
want<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> preview<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.370> just<00:02:14.670> press<00:02:14.850> play<00:02:15.049> and

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
want to preview it just press play and

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.080 
want to preview it just press play and
then<00:02:16.260> slow

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
then slow

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
then slow
and<00:02:20.090> then<00:02:20.300> normal<00:02:20.870> playback<00:02:21.050> slow<00:02:22.240> motion

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and then normal playback slow motion

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.960 
and then normal playback slow motion
then<00:02:24.620> another<00:02:25.040> one<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.490> back<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.880> another

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
then another one will be back in another

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.610 
then another one will be back in another
store<00:02:26.330> emotion<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.440> really

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
store emotion so you can really

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.950 
store emotion so you can really
dramatize<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.820> video<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.420> take<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
dramatize that video that you take and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.450 
dramatize that video that you take and
really<00:02:30.470> make<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.710> something<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.250> can

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
really make it something that you can

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.030 
really make it something that you can
share<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.780> example<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.560> think<00:02:33.950> about

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
share and for example if you think about

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.770 
share and for example if you think about
skateboarding<00:02:34.820> or<00:02:35.060> snowboarding<00:02:35.600> that

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
skateboarding or snowboarding that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.570 
skateboarding or snowboarding that
moment<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.320> do<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.620> trick<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.400> can

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
moment that you do the trick you can

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.460 
moment that you do the trick you can
slow<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.820> down<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.050> make<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> gem

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
slow it down and then really make a gem

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.290 
slow it down and then really make a gem
attached<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:39.920> moment<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.000> um

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
attached that moment so that is just um

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.470 
attached that moment so that is just um
one<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.660> app<00:02:42.050> quanti<00:02:42.800> new<00:02:43.480> applications

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
one of the app quanti new applications

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.890 
one of the app quanti new applications
and<00:02:44.720> also<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:46.040> also<00:02:46.540> enabled<00:02:47.540> creative

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
and also we have also enabled creative

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.290 
and also we have also enabled creative
effects<00:02:48.230> picture<00:02:49.010> effects<00:02:49.340> into<00:02:49.610> actually

four videos as well with this one you'll

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.900 
four videos as well with this one you'll
be<00:02:53.780> able<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.880> have

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.449 
be able to do is you have you have
effects<00:02:56.390> such<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.540> old<00:02:56.870> film<00:02:57.260> or<00:02:57.620> perhaps<00:02:58.130> even

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
effects such as old film or perhaps even

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.110 
effects such as old film or perhaps even
mirror<00:02:58.880> where<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.240> can<00:02:59.450> make<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> couplet

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
mirror where we can make a couplet

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.870 
mirror where we can make a couplet
disappear<00:03:02.120> or<00:03:02.840> make<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.230> up<00:03:03.290> here<00:03:03.320> again<00:03:03.880> right

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
disappear or make it up here again right

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.910 
disappear or make it up here again right
and<00:03:05.120> then<00:03:05.270> what's<00:03:05.540> fun<00:03:05.750> about<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:06.200> is<00:03:06.260> you

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and then what's fun about this is you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.050 
and then what's fun about this is you
can<00:03:06.950> start<00:03:07.280> recording<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:09.260> then<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.910> can

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
can start recording and then you can

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.270 
can start recording and then you can
while<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.600> record<00:03:12.050> you<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:12.980> change

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
while you record you can actually change

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.840 
while you record you can actually change
the<00:03:13.670> effect<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.860> multiple<00:03:16.160> effects

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
the effect you can have multiple effects

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.410 
the effect you can have multiple effects
in<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:17.990> video

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.809 

let's<00:03:23.050> go<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.319> this<00:03:23.440> old<00:03:23.620> film<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.610> very

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
let's go for this old film the very

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.940 
let's go for this old film the very
artistic<00:03:25.780> quote<00:03:26.050> film<00:03:26.410> kind<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.739> feeling

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
artistic quote film kind of a feeling

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.729 
artistic quote film kind of a feeling
and<00:03:27.700> stop<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.420> then<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:29.080> can<00:03:29.260> lead<00:03:29.560> at

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
and stop it and then you can lead at

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.290 
and stop it and then you can lead at
that<00:03:29.920> moment<00:03:30.099> by<00:03:30.370> just<00:03:30.580> playing<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.030> fact

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
that moment by just playing in the fact

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.330 
that moment by just playing in the fact
what<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.200> get<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.590> starting<00:03:35.980> with<00:03:36.010> them

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
what you get is so starting with them

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.520 
what you get is so starting with them
your<00:03:36.580> own<00:03:36.730> effective<00:03:37.239> yet<00:03:37.420> no<00:03:37.780> Mira<00:03:38.260> click

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
your own effective yet no Mira click

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.330 
your own effective yet no Mira click
tablet<00:03:39.340> con<00:03:39.520> then<00:03:40.450> tablet<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.560> penguin<00:03:42.100> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
tablet con then tablet a penguin and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.479 
tablet con then tablet a penguin and
then<00:03:42.930> saturation<00:03:43.930> about<00:03:44.200> comparisons<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.400> you

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
then saturation about comparisons so you

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.540 
then saturation about comparisons so you
can<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:45.819> enjoy<00:03:46.030> fun<00:03:47.020> effects<00:03:47.530> in<00:03:48.340> that

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
can really enjoy fun effects in that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.670 
can really enjoy fun effects in that
video<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.060> make<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.569> make<00:03:49.810> your<00:03:49.989> video<00:03:50.319> me

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
video and make that make your video me

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.250 
video and make that make your video me
mostly<00:03:51.069> so<00:03:51.310> more<00:03:51.610> shareable<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.340> CIO<00:03:55.300> at

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
mostly so more shareable is the CIO at

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.640 
mostly so more shareable is the CIO at
separating<00:03:57.190> house<00:03:57.459> yes<00:03:58.239> yes<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.200> AR<00:03:59.530> effect

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
separating house yes yes the AR effect

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.410 
separating house yes yes the AR effect
as<00:03:59.980> well<00:04:00.299> let's<00:04:01.299> see<00:04:01.630> how<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:01.930> will<00:04:02.230> work<00:04:02.260> here

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
as well let's see how it will work here

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.949 
as well let's see how it will work here
so<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.489> AR<00:04:06.819> effect<00:04:06.970> inexperienced<00:04:07.690> at

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
so with the AR effect inexperienced at

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.020 
so with the AR effect inexperienced at
one<00:04:08.200> we<00:04:08.410> introduce<00:04:08.769> this<00:04:08.920> new<00:04:09.250> app<00:04:09.459> new<00:04:09.670> for

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
one we introduce this new app new for

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.509 
one we introduce this new app new for
application<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:11.530> photos<00:04:11.860> still<00:04:12.160> photos

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
application and for photos still photos

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.570 
application and for photos still photos
what<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.209> have<00:04:13.360> done<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:13.989> time<00:04:14.049> is<00:04:14.500> to

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
what we have done it this time is to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.099
