00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
compare this with any color and it would
just<00:00:52.199> work<00:00:52.559> seamlessly<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.360> second<00:00:54.719> up

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.490 
just work seamlessly so for my second up
item<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
item and I know this is kind of a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
item and I know this is kind of a
strange<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.640> especially<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
strange thing to have especially in the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
strange thing to have especially in the
winter<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.100> really

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
winter but I think it's really really

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
winter but I think it's really really
adorable<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.510> thought<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.840> felt<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.290> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
adorable when I thought I felt like I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.890 
adorable when I thought I felt like I
had<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> fan<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.330> short

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
had to get it and it's this fan a short

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.300 
had to get it and it's this fan a short
overalls<00:01:07.280> they're<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.430> Pam<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:10.049> could<00:01:10.860> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
overalls they're not Pam and I could not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.679 
overalls they're not Pam and I could not
I<00:01:11.549> guess<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.909> lot<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.330> wouldn't

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I guess a lot of people wouldn't

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
I guess a lot of people wouldn't
understand<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> style<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.979> or<00:01:14.250> how<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
understand how to style this or how to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
understand how to style this or how to
wear<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.689> could

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
wear this but I think that this could

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
wear this but I think that this could
really<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.350> work<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.979> those<00:01:17.460> days<00:01:17.700> where

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.160 
really really work on those days where
you<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.060> feel<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> getting<00:01:18.750> too<00:01:18.900> dressed
