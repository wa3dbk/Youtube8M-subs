his<00:00:14.099> own<00:00:14.250> campaign<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.690> actually<00:00:15.960> had<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.740> 0

X<00:00:21.840> which<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.910> unique<00:00:24.210> concept<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
X which was really unique concept and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
X which was really unique concept and
made<00:00:25.170> Megaman<00:00:25.650> x4<00:00:25.859> really<00:00:26.220> stand<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.910> the

made Megaman x4 really stand out in the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
made Megaman x4 really stand out in the
series<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> aside<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.730> pretty

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
series but aside from that it's a pretty

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.359

cover<00:00:32.520> sorry<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> course<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
cover sorry and of course we have the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.660 
cover sorry and of course we have the
Capcom<00:00:34.800> logo<00:00:35.100> down<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:36.980> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> side<00:00:38.370> we

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
Capcom logo down there on the side we

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750 
Capcom logo down there on the side we
have<00:00:38.989> Megaman<00:00:39.989> x4<00:00:40.260> written<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.760> surprisingly

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
have Megaman x4 written in surprisingly

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
have Megaman x4 written in surprisingly
vibrant<00:00:42.329> yellow

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
vibrant yellow

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
vibrant yellow
I<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.820> might<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.149> been<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I think this would might have been a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
I think this would might have been a
trend<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.200> Capcom's<00:00:46.620> games<00:00:46.950> because

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
trend on some of Capcom's games because

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.130 
trend on some of Capcom's games because
I'm<00:00:47.610> pretty<00:00:47.760> sure<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.120> seen<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.629> box<00:00:48.809> for

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I'm pretty sure I've seen the box for

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
I'm pretty sure I've seen the box for
Strider<00:00:49.559> 2<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.579> has<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> same<00:00:51.059> yellow

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Strider 2 and it has the same yellow

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.770 
Strider 2 and it has the same yellow
font<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.059> don't<00:00:54.059> quote<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
font so don't quote me on that but I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
font so don't quote me on that but I
think<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.110> could<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> reason<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:57.210> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
think that could be a reason this is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.170 
think that could be a reason this is
Capcom<00:00:57.510> thing

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
Capcom thing

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180 
Capcom thing

with<00:01:26.520> centimeters<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> sparse<00:01:27.360> graphics

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with centimeters and sparse graphics

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.190 
with centimeters and sparse graphics
hidden<00:01:28.409> secrets<00:01:29.119> making<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.210> x4<00:01:30.570> bombards<00:01:31.079> for

hidden secrets making on x4 bombards for
PlayStation<00:01:31.710> game<00:01:31.890> console<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.340> never<00:01:32.610> lets

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
PlayStation game console and never lets

PlayStation game console and never lets
up<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:34.110> unsurpassed<00:01:34.590> graphics<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
up I think unsurpassed graphics is that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
up I think unsurpassed graphics is that
yeah<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.420> those<00:01:36.570> claims<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> can't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
yeah one of those claims but you can't

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
yeah one of those claims but you can't
really<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.070> exactly<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.180> anyway<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
really back up exactly but anyway and of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
really back up exactly but anyway and of
course<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> another<00:01:42.930> render<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.579> x1<00:01:44.579> on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
course we have a another render of x1 on

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840 
course we have a another render of x1 on
piece<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.060> artwork<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.479> X<00:01:45.600> rather

different<00:02:01.930> main<00:02:02.290> characters<00:02:02.800> well<00:02:03.310> some<00:02:03.880> of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
different main characters well some of

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.540 
different main characters well some of
them<00:02:04.000> anyway<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.020> we've<00:02:05.200> got<00:02:05.410> robot<00:02:06.070> masters

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
them anyway so we've got robot masters

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.120 
them anyway so we've got robot masters
like<00:02:06.880> web<00:02:07.090> spider<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.660> cyber<00:02:07.869> peacock<00:02:08.470> we

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
like web spider and cyber peacock we

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
like web spider and cyber peacock we
have<00:02:09.340> characters<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.030> iris<00:02:10.650> general<00:02:11.650> double

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
have characters like iris general double

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.070 
have characters like iris general double
kernel<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.300> mix<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.630> different<00:02:16.900> things

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
kernel so just a mix of different things

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.690 
kernel so just a mix of different things
out<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.440> frost<00:02:17.709> walrus<00:02:18.100> over<00:02:18.340> there

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
out of this frost walrus over there

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.360 
out of this frost walrus over there
so<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:20.170> initially<00:02:20.709> actually<00:02:21.070> thought<00:02:21.190> was

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
so I initially actually thought was

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.910 
so I initially actually thought was
going<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.640> be<00:02:21.730> b8y<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.600> v8<00:02:22.840> robot<00:02:23.200> masters<00:02:23.680> but

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
going to be b8y a v8 robot masters but

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.810 
going to be b8y a v8 robot masters but
well<00:02:24.730> not<00:02:24.850> robot<00:02:25.120> masters<00:02:25.450> ain't<00:02:25.600> Mavericks

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
well not robot masters ain't Mavericks

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.430 
well not robot masters ain't Mavericks
but<00:02:27.820> apparently<00:02:28.450> not<00:02:28.660> just<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.290> random

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
but apparently not just a random

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440 
but apparently not just a random
assortment<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.040> artwork<00:02:30.520> still<00:02:31.180> pretty<00:02:31.360> nice

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
assortment of artwork still pretty nice

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.180 
assortment of artwork still pretty nice

Playstation and the menu is the doubles

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.759 
Playstation and the menu is the doubles
of<00:02:41.980> different<00:02:42.310> cover<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.730> case<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.290> can

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
of different cover in this case so I can

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.259 
of different cover in this case so I can
just<00:02:44.890> get<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.130> out<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.360> go<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:52.150> just

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
just get that out there we go it's just

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.750 
just get that out there we go it's just
a<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:53.530> short<00:02:53.709> black-and-white<00:02:54.010> manual

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
a really short black-and-white manual

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.820 
a really short black-and-white manual
it's<00:02:54.880> certainly<00:02:55.239> nothing<00:02:55.420> Dicky<00:02:55.900> exciting<00:02:57.480> um

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
it's certainly nothing Dicky exciting um

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.080
