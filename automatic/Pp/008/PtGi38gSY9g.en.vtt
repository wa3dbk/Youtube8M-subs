00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Silver fell into the stormy sea.

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:51.954
Silver and I.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:53.572
I and Silver.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.890
Silver is a traitor and a murderer.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.659
But I...

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.681
don't want to think about that he's probably dead.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.358
We lived through the storm.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:15.988
And the Hispaniola made it.

00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:31.148
We have luck.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
We were taken to the other side of the island.

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:35.762
Come!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.229
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800
Drink and the devil had done for the rest

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:00.635
Yo ho ho and a--

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:08.883
Drink and the devil had done for the rest

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum

00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:36.588
We're going to crash!

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320
I'd like to know how things look in the fort.

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:13.416
Who knows if the others are safe?

00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:40.805
We arrived at the southern side of the island.

00:04:40.857 --> 00:04:42.857
It's on the other side of the island.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.008
If we don't hurry,

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:47.068
it'll be too dark to reach the fort.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.484
Faster, Benbow!

00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:55.667
We have to get to the fort.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.300
Be careful, Benbow.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.855
The fort is probably still surrounded by pirates.
