00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.299
 did you ever imagine that vision of 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.420
 some way where they're going to believe it but 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.460
 in dreams I dream and I told Raul 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.950
 that's part of my team that's 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.769
 they sent them twice to the canvas so 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.840
 I dreamed so I visualized it and so it happened but of 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.019
 the way it is with that was that it fell 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 well that way I did not connect him 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.090
 he threw me some two and in a hit that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 will emit his right hand and I put his 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.070
 guard and he logged on to enter that 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.200
 many hand weights against people 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.170
 we will review the images when we 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.239
 You are explaining precisely technically 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.399
 what happened what we are going to do 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.289
 more images of this combat is already 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.809
 the third episode the long right 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.920
 that we talked so much about when 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.500
 we did it up in the ring of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.510
 backlash dances you land because today 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.969
 if it falls down badly and familiarly I connect it 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.590
 pretty good to the jaw painted him the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.020
 wide down I had already thrown several 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.040
 times below the belt the hook and I 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.870
 I connected clean the jaw 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.870
 arrives at the stumble arrives this time 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.010
 but at the same time with the stumble 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 relevant was to want to finish the fight 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.240
 this was the best moment of the place 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.100
 that's how you beat him with what you know best 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.979
 to do is a dragon the science we talk about 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.840
 that we have to take advantage of the point 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.940
 when we least have it, we have to 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.759
 Take advantage to pour between a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.830
 dream if it was like this from 2d to a sporting 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.720
 during his training a lefty who 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.850
 sells exactly the same backlash 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
 two the sides to pain and it comes to 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 reflect in the combat of this phase 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.940
 we were working is a lot in the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.070
 preparation about him since where do I 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780
 got in and threw his right hand and almost 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.670
 it turned out because what we are 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 waiting and it turned out perfectly 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 because you did not throw yourself away in the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.430
 third episode when you send to the canvas 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 to manny pacquiao because we know that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 Manny Pacquiao is a rival between 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 the more injured is more dangerous 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.259
 we wanted to work wanted 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.760
 take things with intelligence I 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 I think he's never going to come alone he was going to 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.750
 come alone and somehow we have 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.040
 deliver because I have raised a 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.360
 fighter between more often are 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.100
 kept an animal that has a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.020
 respectable stuck then we're not going 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.670
 to deliver so easily you did not give 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.709
 mind that manny pacquiao was not that 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.510
 speak tonight knowing from that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.420
 fall from that we were born working 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.620
 little by little we are went looking 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.390
 connect it pretty solid blows that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.640
 if it turned out and at the end of accounts in the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.230
 sixth round I go back or manuel I was 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.390
 in the ring immediately 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.090
 after the fight the privilege of 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.500
 practice continue with and with manny me 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.060
 realized that when you need knockout 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 you celebrate and the first thing you do is go to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.030
 look for an animal that stops when you 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.640
 you arrived 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.770
 he was still unconscious in the tapestry 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 then when everything starts its first 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.030
 interview comes 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.910
 what was that exchange of words 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.980
 between one more tell us that a great 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.620
 fight with his great fighter and what 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.300
 I recognize and the truth that was his 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.970
 exchanged congratulate him for the great 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.430
 fight and for the opportunity that I 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.800
 gave to accept this fourth lawsuit 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.410
 happy with that triumph and he of some 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.090
 way as it did not believe error 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.580
 now we talk in the week that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.880
 I asked knees where I would present 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.860
 a victory over manny pacquiao 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 and I think we fell short that is 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.600
 what he did not offer and you two guasa 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.819
 the analysis of boxing history is 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 can compare with epic energy 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.670
 come from the 80s you are conscious 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.670
 of that
