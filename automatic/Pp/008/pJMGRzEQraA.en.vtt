00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.750

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.210

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.710
 the reel I started at about 630 grams is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.710
 very well of weight has I think it has 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.270
 about 10 bearings 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170
 OK 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.600
 and I 'm going to show you a bit how it is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.090
 As you can see they have lost weight 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.080
 here in the tapita the little holes 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.080

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:06.600
 Calvete comes with the drink that is all 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 I'm going to show you the coil 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.460
 this is the coil to 10,000 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.480
 I already have the quick hitch set for 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.550
 On Sunday I have a contest if that 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.570
 went up to the best if there was anything some 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.040
 video or something from you pulled out some piece and 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.040
 well I was win to 10,000 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.600
 I fit I have 30 style because I'm going 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.259
 to fish rock then rumba pages 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.439
 that I have here they say almost 600 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.570
 meters that fit many meters and now 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.570
 I'm going to teach the coil to 6000 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.880
 here is the coils in me 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.730
 here I'll put a thread of 16 there by 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:20.850
 beach and I'll buy myself more rare bubbles 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.630
 Here fit 30 200 meters as 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.810
 they fit many meters of them 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.450
 on a thread of 16 they play 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 with a bridge and for the beach 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.850
 after 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 here you have the reel inside 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.440
 with his queen and the spider the spider some 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 they take it off but I do not like to take it 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 the spider serves because when 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.760
 you have to not make the metal thread 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.849
 under the coil 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.900
 here is the lever is back 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.900
 and ahead 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.830
 well I think it's a card and that 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.580
 he is very cool 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.300
 it also has the system this when 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.720
 you open what 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.480
 and when I throw it is that it did not give us a 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.870
 toothpick 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.870
 9 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.850
 when you will say that it is not the closing 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.660
