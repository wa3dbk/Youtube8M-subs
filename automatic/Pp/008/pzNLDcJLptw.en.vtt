00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
with some braids yeah so the no stretch

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.280 
with some braids yeah so the no stretch
braid<00:02:27.489> for<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> line<00:02:28.060> you've<00:02:28.660> read<00:02:28.870> mono<00:02:29.080> i've

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
braid for the line you've read mono i've

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
braid for the line you've read mono i've
got<00:02:29.470> mono<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.980> other<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.390> doesn't

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
got mono on the other one it doesn't

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.880 
got mono on the other one it doesn't
matter<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:31.870> way<00:02:31.900> or<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.140> other<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.590> then

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
matter one way or the other and then

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.380 
matter one way or the other and then
we've<00:02:33.069> rigged<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.640> up<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.910> slip

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
we've rigged this one up with a slip

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.479 
we've rigged this one up with a slip
float<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.380> with<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> float<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.040> slides

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
float and with the float that slides

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.910 
float and with the float that slides
free<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> line<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.569> then<00:02:38.019> further<00:02:38.410> up<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
free in the line and then further up the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.490 
free in the line and then further up the
line<00:02:39.100> we've<00:02:39.459> thread<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.630> Robert

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
line we've thread it on a little Robert

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.199 
line we've thread it on a little Robert
Ross<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.220> up<00:02:42.310> where<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.760> buy<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:42.910> this

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
Ross it up where you can buy it this

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.699 
Ross it up where you can buy it this
portion<00:02:43.720> yeah<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.049> get<00:02:44.200> them<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.470> float

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
portion yeah you get them with the float

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.759 
portion yeah you get them with the float
so<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.220> float<00:02:45.989> slides<00:02:46.989> up<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.170> line<00:02:47.440> and

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
so that float slides up the line and

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.560 
so that float slides up the line and
then<00:02:47.920> stops<00:02:48.250> at<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> mom<00:02:48.700> shaking<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.209> you

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
then stops at the mom shaking it you

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.020 
then stops at the mom shaking it you
know<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:50.320> that<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:51.310> ever<00:02:51.459> depth<00:02:51.700> we're

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
know just that not ever depth we're

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
know just that not ever depth we're
fishing<00:02:52.269> about<00:02:52.350> 750<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.620> we've<00:02:53.769> got<00:02:53.920> there's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
fishing about 750 so we've got there's

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.060 
fishing about 750 so we've got there's
our<00:02:54.549> float<00:02:54.850> in<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> stop<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.440> got<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> swivel

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
our float in a stop and we got a swivel

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.800 
our float in a stop and we got a swivel
I<00:02:57.310> think<00:02:58.239> one<00:02:58.390> thing<00:02:58.570> that's<00:02:58.630> really

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
I think one thing that's really

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.960 
I think one thing that's really
important<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.709> float<00:03:00.160> has<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.579> be<00:03:00.700> small

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
important is that float has to be small

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.699 
important is that float has to be small
it<00:03:01.209> has<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.450> be<00:03:01.540> sense<00:03:01.810> yeah<00:03:02.109> it's<00:03:02.350> too<00:03:02.500> big<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
it has to be sense yeah it's too big you

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.380 
it has to be sense yeah it's too big you
won't<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.640> are<00:03:03.790> kind<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.030> these

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
won't see that these are kind of these

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.690 
won't see that these are kind of these
are<00:03:04.540> very<00:03:04.780> sensitive<00:03:05.049> Blackbird<00:03:06.040> floats<00:03:06.370> just

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
are very sensitive Blackbird floats just

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.340 
are very sensitive Blackbird floats just
like<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> straight<00:03:07.090> indicator<00:03:07.540> now<00:03:08.079> we<00:03:08.170> got<00:03:08.320> a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
like a straight indicator now we got a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.250 
like a straight indicator now we got a
swivel<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:08.980> then<00:03:09.549> our<00:03:09.730> leader<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.420> you've

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
swivel and then our leader and you've

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.670 
swivel and then our leader and you've
got<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:11.739> split<00:03:12.070> shot<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.519> there<00:03:13.500> don't<00:03:14.500> pull

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
got for split shot on there don't pull

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.580 
got for split shot on there don't pull
the<00:03:14.769> float<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:15.160> there<00:03:15.310> no<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> fly<00:03:16.750> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
the float on there no and to the fly and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.259 
the float on there no and to the fly and
no<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.130> everything<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.640> sits<00:03:18.850> in<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.060> water

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
no so everything just sits in the water

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.870 
no so everything just sits in the water
and<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.709> way<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:20.920> do<00:03:21.100> your<00:03:21.280> fishing<00:03:21.700> very

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and and the way you do your fishing very

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.340 
and and the way you do your fishing very
similar<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.390> way<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:22.630> should<00:03:22.780> fly<00:03:23.079> all<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
similar the way we should fly all the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.680 
similar the way we should fly all the
same<00:03:23.650> say<00:03:24.280> every<00:03:24.549> bit<00:03:24.700> as<00:03:24.850> effective<00:03:25.000> every

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
same say every bit as effective every

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.650 
same say every bit as effective every
pitch<00:03:26.079> is<00:03:26.109> short<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.010> really<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:28.269> is<00:03:28.329> like

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
pitch is short so really this is like

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.410 
pitch is short so really this is like
you<00:03:28.840> could<00:03:29.459> for<00:03:30.459> families<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.910> get<00:03:30.970> started

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
you could for families to get started

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
you could for families to get started
it's<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:32.049> can<00:03:32.350> by<00:03:32.500> spinning<00:03:33.010> rod<00:03:33.160> combos

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
it's but you can by spinning rod combos

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's but you can by spinning rod combos
very<00:03:34.209> inexpensive<00:03:34.900> absolutely<00:03:35.790> don't<00:03:36.790> need

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
very inexpensive absolutely don't need

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.069 
very inexpensive absolutely don't need
to<00:03:37.000> be<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.269> bowl<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.450> can<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.780> this<00:03:37.930> from

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
to be in a bowl you can do this from

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.900 
to be in a bowl you can do this from
shops<00:03:38.380> lately<00:03:38.829> yeah<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> lot<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.579> fish<00:03:39.730> we

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
shops lately yeah a lot of the fish we

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.569 
shops lately yeah a lot of the fish we
catch<00:03:40.120> are<00:03:40.650> pretty<00:03:41.650> much<00:03:41.799> anchored<00:03:42.190> on<00:03:42.310> shore

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
catch are pretty much anchored on shore

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.920 
catch are pretty much anchored on shore
it<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.790> actually<00:03:42.940> pretty<00:03:43.329> sick<00:03:43.510> from<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.810> end

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
it can actually pretty sick from the end

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.980 
it can actually pretty sick from the end
