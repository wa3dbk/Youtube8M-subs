00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
do that or they can't get over the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
do that or they can't get over the
Canadian<00:01:24.549> border<00:01:24.729> for<00:01:24.999> whatever<00:01:25.149> reason

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
Canadian border for whatever reason

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.779 
Canadian border for whatever reason
there's<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.979> lot<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.219> people<00:01:27.399> that<00:01:27.520> can't<00:01:27.670> get

there's a lot of people that can't get

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.249 
there's a lot of people that can't get
over<00:01:27.969> international<00:01:28.329> borders<00:01:28.569> so<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.049> have<00:01:29.140> to

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
over international borders so we have to

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.630 
over international borders so we have to
keep<00:01:29.859> that<00:01:30.009> in<00:01:30.159> mind<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.649> third<00:01:33.490> reason

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
keep that in mind and the third reason

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
keep that in mind and the third reason
is<00:01:34.030> gonna<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.630> most<00:01:34.749> obvious<00:01:34.929> reason

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
is gonna be the most obvious reason

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450 
is gonna be the most obvious reason
funds<00:01:36.600> financing<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:38.319> not<00:01:38.530> exactly<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.100> cheap

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
funds financing it's not exactly a cheap

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.190 
funds financing it's not exactly a cheap

Alaska trip just getting to Vancouver
from<00:03:28.540> where<00:03:28.750> they<00:03:28.870> happen<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.320> down<00:03:29.590> south

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
from where they happen to be down south

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860 
from where they happen to be down south
would<00:03:30.130> have<00:03:30.220> been<00:03:30.340> half<00:03:30.550> a<00:03:30.670> trip<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.060> them<00:03:31.150> you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
would have been half a trip for them you

would have been half a trip for them you
know<00:03:31.960> it<00:03:32.050> would<00:03:32.170> have<00:03:32.260> been<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.500> huge<00:03:32.650> trip<00:03:32.950> and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160

know it would have been a huge trip and
so<00:03:33.310> here<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.520> am<00:03:33.790> thinking<00:03:33.940> jeez<00:03:34.210> that's<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.480> long

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
so here I am thinking jeez that's a long

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.330 
so here I am thinking jeez that's a long
way<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.870> go<00:03:35.080> from<00:03:35.290> Vancouver<00:03:35.770> all<00:03:35.890> could<00:03:36.190> just

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
way to go from Vancouver all could just

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.710 
way to go from Vancouver all could just
imagine<00:03:36.520> if<00:03:36.790> you're<00:03:36.910> coming<00:03:37.090> down<00:03:37.210> from<00:03:37.420> even

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
imagine if you're coming down from even

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.440 
imagine if you're coming down from even
farther<00:03:37.960> south<00:03:38.230> than<00:03:38.890> Vancouver<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:40.060> this

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
farther south than Vancouver but this

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.800 
farther south than Vancouver but this
way<00:03:41.280> everyone<00:03:42.280> can<00:03:42.460> meet<00:03:42.580> up<00:03:42.760> we're<00:03:43.420> thinking

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
way everyone can meet up we're thinking

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.780 
of course and I think that would just be
a<00:03:56.440> fantastic<00:03:56.860> thing<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:57.430> we<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.670> make
