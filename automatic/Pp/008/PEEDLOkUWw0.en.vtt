00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
modern warfare 3 and 3 was because

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
modern warfare 3 and 3 was because
youtube<00:00:47.760> sub<00:00:48.000> boxes<00:00:48.420> were<00:00:48.570> broken<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
youtube sub boxes were broken so if you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.459 
youtube sub boxes were broken so if you
don't<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.969> YouTube<00:00:51.210> sub<00:00:51.629> boxes<00:00:51.989> fail<00:00:52.230> from

don't know YouTube sub boxes fail from
time<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> time<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.730> upload

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
time to time and when they do you upload

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
time to time and when they do you upload
and<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.629> half<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.140> actual<00:00:55.620> audience

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and about half of your actual audience

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
and about half of your actual audience
actually<00:00:56.219> sees<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> video<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.109> what

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
actually sees the video so that's what

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
actually sees the video so that's what
end<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.530> happening<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.420> unfortunately<00:01:00.420> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
end up happening and unfortunately I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.849 
end up happening and unfortunately I
wasn't<00:01:00.750> getting<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> best<00:01:01.289> views<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.680> those

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.709 
wasn't getting the best views for those
couple<00:01:02.039> days<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> figured<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
couple days so I figured in now is the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
couple days so I figured in now is the
time<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> take<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> break<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> hate

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
time to take a break I kind of hate

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
time to take a break I kind of hate

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
modern warfare 3 and I pretty much

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.450 
modern warfare 3 and I pretty much
stopped<00:01:07.380> playing<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> game<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.220> five

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
stopped playing the game for about five

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.270 
stopped playing the game for about five
straight<00:01:08.880> days<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> good<00:01:09.750> break<00:01:10.280> but

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
straight days which is a good break but

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.560 
straight days which is a good break but
I've<00:01:11.460> still<00:01:11.700> been<00:01:11.760> planning<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> past

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
