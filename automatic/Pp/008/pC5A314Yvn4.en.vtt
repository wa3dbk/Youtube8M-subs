take this to fold to the center but only
that<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:38.930> now<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.360

the next thing you do you take these two

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.170 
the next thing you do you take these two
lines<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.270> created<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:56.180> meet

them up right there like so
now<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.680> center<00:01:14.280> line<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.909> quarter

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
now there is a center line a quarter

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.120 
now there is a center line a quarter
line<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.140> sixteenth<00:01:17.070> line<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.820> eighth<00:01:18.240> line

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
line a sixteenth line and eighth line

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.030 
line a sixteenth line and eighth line
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.460> fold<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.540> edge<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.920> the

you want to fold this very edge to the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:41.630 
you want to fold this very edge to the
quarter<00:01:23.460> line<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> eighth<00:01:40.640> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
quarter line and then to the eighth then

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.280 
quarter line and then to the eighth then
you<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.659> open<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.790> like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:46.170> you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
like that again and you should be able

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:13.170 
like that again and you should be able
to<00:02:53.220> tuck<00:02:54.220> this<00:03:10.410> stand<00:03:11.410> up<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:12.970> how

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
to tuck this stand up and that is how

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.099 
to tuck this stand up and that is how
you<00:03:13.239> create<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:14.260> paper<00:03:14.859> Domino<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.940> since<00:03:16.840> one

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
you create a paper Domino and since one

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.000 
you create a paper Domino and since one
sheet<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.470> paper<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.950> costs<00:03:18.310> exactly<00:03:19.560> one<00:03:20.560> cent

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
sheet of paper it costs exactly one cent

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.360 
sheet of paper it costs exactly one cent
well<00:03:21.639> that's<00:03:22.060> actually<00:03:22.209> approximate<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:23.859> you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
well that's actually approximate if you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.360 
well that's actually approximate if you
make<00:03:24.609> for<00:03:25.000> smaller<00:03:25.420> Domino's<00:03:26.139> you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.160> make<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
make for smaller Domino's you can make a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.479 
make for smaller Domino's you can make a
whole<00:03:30.180> deck<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.510> guess<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:32.290> Domino's<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:33.280> whole

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
whole deck I guess of Domino's a whole

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.670 
whole deck I guess of Domino's a whole
stack<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.910> Domino's<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:35.019> yes<00:03:35.400> which<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.609> 28<00:03:37.680> for

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
stack of Domino's so yes which is 28 for

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.370 
stack of Domino's so yes which is 28 for
only<00:03:38.889> seven<00:03:39.340> cents<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.150> if<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.780> make<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> box

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
only seven cents and if you make a box

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.740 
only seven cents and if you make a box
for<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.889> that<00:03:42.549> will<00:03:42.670> only<00:03:42.880> cost<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.480> eight

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
for it that will only cost you eight

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.729 
for it that will only cost you eight
cents<00:03:44.200> normal<00:03:45.010> Domino's<00:03:45.489> cost<00:03:45.880> more<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.500> this

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
cents normal Domino's cost more so this

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.910 
cents normal Domino's cost more so this
is<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.130> cheap<00:03:48.430> way<00:03:48.750> yet<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.930> working<00:03:50.319> way<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
is the cheap way yet the working way of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.140 
is the cheap way yet the working way of
making<00:03:51.400> dumb<00:03:51.609> knows<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.209> can<00:03:52.359> stack<00:03:52.919> or

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
making dumb knows that you can stack or

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.770
