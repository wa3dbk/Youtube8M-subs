00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
interesting I'm next I'm thinking maybe

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.720 
interesting I'm next I'm thinking maybe
it's<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.180> piece<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.510> jewelry<00:03:24.410> perhaps<00:03:27.640> it's<00:03:28.640> a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
it's a piece of jewelry perhaps it's a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.360 
it's a piece of jewelry perhaps it's a
little<00:03:28.970> heart<00:03:30.910> it's<00:03:31.910> like<00:03:32.120> where<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.450> had<00:03:32.630> a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
little heart it's like where it had a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.060 
little heart it's like where it had a
pin<00:03:34.370> attachment<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> back<00:03:35.360> maybe

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
pin attachment on the back maybe

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.960 
pin attachment on the back maybe
starting<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.160> think<00:03:37.280> this<00:03:37.370> little<00:03:37.640> area<00:03:37.790> here

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
starting to think this little area here

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.850 
starting to think this little area here
