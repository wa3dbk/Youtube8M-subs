00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.720
 various times we use the program provided the pre-notice accusation in its way 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.389
 with more folder opening the images or like these 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.029
 and then closing 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.269
 because we do not know is that there are several tools that are 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.020
 directly in this program that we can do 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.070
 until some of the points that most played some corrections the boyfriend some 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.560
 of these tools 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.010
 and how it can facilitate the manipulation of images depends only on 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.800
 me 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 one of the interesting things is that we can see what the information is 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 of the picture 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.410
 the camera crashed 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.880
 other was the exposure with the focal length a series of other 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.690
 information in some cases up to the location dps of the photo it all 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.330
 directly inside 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.330
 the entire preview program 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.700
 xuxa interesting is that we can do some course corrections 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 directly the program for viewing 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 this image then the characteristic plus 30 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.870
 can be directly corrected the years in photo correction tool 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.120
 tonality 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400
 of the prize 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.220
 among other things we also have the contrast correction correction 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.550
 saturation 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.550
 I had not had a temperature 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.339
 and then just save the file 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.109
 another interesting tool that we have in Brazil is the manipulation of 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.199
 pandora 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.179
 here in this folder I have several projects that were priced at one 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.159
 site 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.819
 and I would like to have only one document with all that material 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 so I can open the first project 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.489
 to dismiss the second stone 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.779
 in the third to always great 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.159
 directly in the sequence 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.329
 the trident of brazil 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 he will add the pedestrian tracks 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.579
 my original document 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.429
 after doing this with all the files 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:22.769
 I have a file 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.989
 the only goal is all the material 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.429
 17 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.429
 required 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.289
 another interesting function in perverse manipulation 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.669
 so I can do this for pedestrians I do not know if I can take page 33 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.959
 or because it is imperative 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.959
 or because I would like to create 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.159
 I would like to take a pedestrian document with only a few 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.839
 room information 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.049
 in this part 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.059
 this page for example does not offer pit burned village simply 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.189
 pressing dale 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.339
 I go to keyboard 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.739
 and if I want to remove some of these parcels with to show how 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.399
 just get the gaspar pages 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.209
 this will create a pdf 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 crazy only with these pages 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.739
 another interesting function 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 it is with the constant 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.739
 I can move the fungus a few weeks 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.330
 simply using the tool to injure yourself 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.039
 to the rest campus 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.439
 he will look for similar things evair 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.379
 he allowed to turn off 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.379
 the background of the image 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.279
 thus 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.529
 I'll have promotional image 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.059
 to be used 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.499
 in another file that complements the information
