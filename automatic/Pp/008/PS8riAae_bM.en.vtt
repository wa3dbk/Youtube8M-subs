hi Paul from Deutsche auto parts today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.789 
hi Paul from Deutsche auto parts today
we're<00:00:03.210> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.480> going<00:00:03.659> over<00:00:03.899> carbon

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
we're going to be going over carbon

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.130 
we're going to be going over carbon
buildup<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.339> direct<00:00:05.730> injection<00:00:06.299> engines<00:00:06.690> this

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
buildup on direct injection engines this

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.100 
buildup on direct injection engines this
is<00:00:07.379> on<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.099> intake<00:00:08.519> valves<00:00:08.970> themselves<00:00:09.150> we're

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
is on the intake valves themselves we're

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.140 
is on the intake valves themselves we're
going<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.530> including<00:00:11.340> information<00:00:11.610> about

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
going to be including information about

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.810 
going to be including information about
how<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.929> happens<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.679> things<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> be

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
how it happens and things that can be

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.080 
how it happens and things that can be
done<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.179> prevent<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:22.070> the<00:00:23.070> problem<00:00:23.519> related

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
done to prevent it the problem related

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.480 
done to prevent it the problem related
to<00:00:24.300> direct<00:00:24.689> injection<00:00:25.410> carbon<00:00:25.859> buildup<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to direct injection carbon buildup is a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.779 
to direct injection carbon buildup is a
fairly<00:00:27.090> new<00:00:27.210> issue<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> new<00:00:29.609> issue

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
fairly new issue this is a new issue

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
fairly new issue this is a new issue
mostly<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.539> direct<00:00:31.170> injection<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
mostly because direct injection is

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.490 
mostly because direct injection is
becoming<00:00:32.189> much<00:00:32.910> more<00:00:33.149> prevalent<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.930> widely

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
becoming much more prevalent and widely

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.110 
becoming much more prevalent and widely
used<00:00:34.710> across<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.489> models<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.239> vehicles

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
used across all models all vehicles

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
used across all models all vehicles
specifically<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.899> reason<00:00:40.320> why<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.530> happens

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
specifically the reason why it happens

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
specifically the reason why it happens
is<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> port<00:00:42.030> injection<00:00:42.360> engine

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
is because on a port injection engine

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
is because on a port injection engine
the<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.649> fuel<00:00:43.980> injectors<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> intake

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the in fuel injectors in the intake

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.619 
the in fuel injectors in the intake
manifold<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.039> intake<00:00:47.489> air<00:00:47.730> comes<00:00:48.329> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
manifold so as the intake air comes in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.049 
manifold so as the intake air comes in
the<00:00:49.320> fuel<00:00:49.590> injector<00:00:50.010> sprays<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> back<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the fuel injector sprays on the back of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.619 
the fuel injector sprays on the back of
the<00:00:51.120> intake<00:00:51.420> valve<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.010> help

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
the intake valve that will then help

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
the intake valve that will then help
clean<00:00:54.629> off<00:00:54.840> any<00:00:55.170> carbon<00:00:55.800> buildup<00:00:56.070> coming<00:00:56.489> back

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
clean off any carbon buildup coming back

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.569 
clean off any carbon buildup coming back
on<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.449> valve<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.559> allow<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
on to that valve and then allow it to be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
on to that valve and then allow it to be
burned<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.449> combustion<00:01:00.840> chamber<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
burned in the combustion chamber on a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
burned in the combustion chamber on a
direct<00:01:02.730> injection<00:01:02.910> engine<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> fuel

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
direct injection engine the fuel

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
direct injection engine the fuel
injector<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> inside<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> cylinder<00:01:05.460> which

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
injector is inside the cylinder which

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
injector is inside the cylinder which
means<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> fuel<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> sprayed<00:01:07.200> inside<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
means the fuel is sprayed inside the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.789 
means the fuel is sprayed inside the
cylinder<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.820> combust<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
cylinder and combust there so as the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.789 
cylinder and combust there so as the
intake<00:01:11.189> air<00:01:11.400> comes<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> air<00:01:13.470> flows

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
intake air comes in the air flows

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.080 
intake air comes in the air flows
directly<00:01:14.070> over<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> back<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> intake

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
directly over the back of the intake

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
directly over the back of the intake
valve<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.350> nothing<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.920> there

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
valve and there's nothing in there

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
valve and there's nothing in there
cleaning<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> off<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> reason<00:01:19.200> why<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
cleaning it off the reason why the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
cleaning it off the reason why the
carbon<00:01:20.280> buildup<00:01:20.580> happens<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.630> valve<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
carbon buildup happens on the valve and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
carbon buildup happens on the valve and
the<00:01:22.409> reason<00:01:22.710> why<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.670> carbon<00:01:23.939> coming

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the reason why you do get carbon coming

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
the reason why you do get carbon coming
in<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.500> don't<00:01:25.619> clean<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> valves<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
in if you don't clean the valves is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.690 
in if you don't clean the valves is
because<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> PCV<00:01:28.140> system<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> PCV

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
because of the PCV system so the PCV

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.020 
because of the PCV system so the PCV
systems<00:01:30.270> function<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.530> take<00:01:31.790> blow-by<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
systems function is to take blow-by that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
systems function is to take blow-by that
comes<00:01:33.240> past<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> piston<00:01:34.170> during<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
comes past the piston during the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.030 
comes past the piston during the
combustion<00:01:34.890> process<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.079> vent<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
combustion process and vent it out of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
combustion process and vent it out of
the<00:01:38.100> crankcase<00:01:38.540> things<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the crankcase things that are in this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.399 
the crankcase things that are in this
would<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.680> things<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.329> fuel<00:01:42.329> vapors<00:01:42.810> oil

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
would be things like fuel vapors oil

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.069 
would be things like fuel vapors oil
vapors<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> any<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
vapors and any other things that will be

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
vapors and any other things that will be
unburned<00:01:46.500> during<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.630> process<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
unburned during the process of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.219 
unburned during the process of
combustion<00:01:49.399> that<00:01:50.399> gets<00:01:50.790> routed<00:01:51.780> from<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
combustion that gets routed from a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.920 
combustion that gets routed from a
crankcase<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.579> engine<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
crankcase up the engine and then out in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
crankcase up the engine and then out in
and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.590> reroute<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> into<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> intake

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and then reroute it into the intake

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.319 
and then reroute it into the intake
manifold<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.899> emissions<00:01:58.530> purposes<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.329> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
manifold for emissions purposes as that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.719 
manifold for emissions purposes as that
comes<00:02:01.079> into<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.590> intake<00:02:01.860> manifold<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.579> will

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
comes into the intake manifold it will

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
comes into the intake manifold it will
then<00:02:02.909> leave<00:02:03.090> those<00:02:03.329> deposits<00:02:03.659> along<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.590> way

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
then leave those deposits along the way

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
then leave those deposits along the way
mostly<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> valves<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
mostly on the valves because it is the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.830 
mostly on the valves because it is the
most<00:02:07.170> restrictive<00:02:07.649> point<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.539> intake

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
on it now as you can see this is a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020 
on it now as you can see this is a
pretty<00:02:52.170> significant<00:02:53.010> amount<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.580> buildup<00:02:53.940> on

this it's it's very visible and it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.510 
this it's it's very visible and it's
pretty<00:02:57.870> bad<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:58.620> once<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.040> gets<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> this

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
pretty bad now once it gets to this

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.380 
pretty bad now once it gets to this
point<00:02:59.960> when<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:02.120> significant<00:03:03.120> build-up

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
point when you have significant build-up

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.660 
point when you have significant build-up
like<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.440> has<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.740> be<00:03:04.980> manually<00:03:05.340> cleaned

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
like this it has to be manually cleaned

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.950 
like this it has to be manually cleaned
so<00:03:05.850> what<00:03:06.000> has<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.300> happen<00:03:06.330> during<00:03:06.840> that

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
so what has to happen during that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.510 
so what has to happen during that
process<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> manifold<00:03:08.100> has<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.430> be

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
process is the manifold has to be

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.930 
process is the manifold has to be
removed<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.780> has<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.080> be<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.370> valves<00:03:11.730> must

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
removed and it has to be the valves must

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
removed and it has to be the valves must
be<00:03:12.060> cleaned<00:03:12.390> by<00:03:12.570> hand<00:03:12.600> or<00:03:13.200> by<00:03:13.950> some<00:03:14.190> other

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
be cleaned by hand or by some other

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.600 
be cleaned by hand or by some other
mechanism<00:03:14.940> all<00:03:15.240> right<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.600> what<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:15.960> we<00:03:16.020> do

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
mechanism all right so what can we do

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.790 
mechanism all right so what can we do
with<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.820> carbon<00:03:18.270> problem<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.380> mentioned

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
with this carbon problem as I mentioned

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.580 
with this carbon problem as I mentioned
before<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:21.480> car<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.930> had<00:03:22.080> 75

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
before that that car that had 75

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470 
before that that car that had 75
thousand<00:03:23.040> miles<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.940> had<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.330> be

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
thousand miles on it it had to be

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.230 
thousand miles on it it had to be
manually<00:03:24.870> cleaned<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:26.010> options<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:26.910> in

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
manually cleaned the options you have in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.180 
manually cleaned the options you have in
that<00:03:27.360> situation<00:03:27.420> are<00:03:28.110> only<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.740> remove<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
that situation are only to remove the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.700 
that situation are only to remove the
intake<00:03:29.460> manifold<00:03:30.000> now<00:03:30.480> how<00:03:30.960> you<00:03:31.020> clean<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> is

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
intake manifold now how you clean it is

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.680 
intake manifold now how you clean it is
going<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.100> vary<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.820> lot<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.300> times<00:03:33.480> what

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
going to vary a lot of times what

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.630 
going to vary a lot of times what
they'll<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:33.960> is<00:03:34.140> they<00:03:34.320> will<00:03:34.350> take<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> chemical

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
they'll do is they will take a chemical

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.610 
they'll do is they will take a chemical
soak<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.330> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.540> valves<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.350> clean<00:03:37.590> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
soak it on the valves and then clean it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.800 
soak it on the valves and then clean it
by<00:03:37.800> hand<00:03:38.040> with<00:03:38.220> picks<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:38.610> scrapers<00:03:39.570> and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
things like that also another popular

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.790 
things like that also another popular
solution<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:44.970> soda<00:03:45.300> blasting<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.770> a

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
solution is soda blasting this is a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.590 
solution is soda blasting this is a
great<00:03:47.070> solution<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.580> will<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.940> very<00:03:47.970> clean

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
great solution it will get it very clean

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.130 
great solution it will get it very clean
but<00:03:48.780> also<00:03:48.840> soda<00:03:49.440> blasting<00:03:49.860> makes<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.190> mess<00:03:51.140> also

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
but also soda blasting makes a mess also

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.050 
but also soda blasting makes a mess also
another<00:03:52.320> similar<00:03:53.190> solution<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.850> soda

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
another similar solution to soda

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.080 
another similar solution to soda
blasting<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.540> walnut<00:03:54.750> blasting<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.620> they<00:03:55.740> take

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
blasting is walnut blasting so they take

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.760 
blasting is walnut blasting so they take
walnut<00:03:57.090> shells<00:03:57.390> crushed<00:03:57.780> walnut<00:03:58.230> shells<00:03:58.470> and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
walnut shells crushed walnut shells and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.030 
walnut shells crushed walnut shells and
use<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.730> as<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> media<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:01.380> get<00:04:01.560> rid<00:04:01.710> of<00:04:01.740> all<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
use it as a media to get rid of all the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.040 
use it as a media to get rid of all the
carbon<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:02.520> there<00:04:02.730> again<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.660> will<00:04:03.810> make<00:04:04.020> a

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
carbon on there again it will make a

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.710 
carbon on there again it will make a
pretty<00:04:04.320> big<00:04:04.500> mess<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.330> have<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.630> have

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
pretty big mess and you have to have

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.940 
pretty big mess and you have to have
special<00:04:06.930> tools<00:04:07.320> from<00:04:07.560> both<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.740> those

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
special tools from both of those

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.610 
special tools from both of those
processes<00:04:08.280> if<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.060> allow<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:10.140> carbon

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
processes if you allow the carbon

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.810 
processes if you allow the carbon
buildup<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.890> get<00:04:11.070> bad<00:04:11.220> enough<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.580> house

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
buildup to get bad enough so the house

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.730 
buildup to get bad enough so the house
that<00:04:12.120> you're<00:04:12.480> having<00:04:12.630> issues<00:04:12.870> related<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
that you're having issues related to it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.680 
that you're having issues related to it
like<00:04:13.950> let's<00:04:14.190> say<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.610> 60,000<00:04:15.390> miles<00:04:15.510> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
like let's say you have 60,000 miles and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.030 
like let's say you have 60,000 miles and
there's<00:04:15.840> been<00:04:15.990> nothing<00:04:16.170> done<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> vehicle

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
there's been nothing done with a vehicle

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.830 
there's been nothing done with a vehicle
you're<00:04:17.820> probably<00:04:18.120> getting<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.690> point

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
you're probably getting to the point

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.969 
you're probably getting to the point
where<00:04:18.989> you're<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.260> need<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.560> clean<00:04:19.890> the

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
where you're and I need to clean the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.460 
where you're and I need to clean the
carbon<00:04:20.280> off<00:04:20.400> now<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.150> other<00:04:21.330> option<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.989> okay

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
carbon off now the other option is okay

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.310 
carbon off now the other option is okay
how<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:22.890> we<00:04:23.280> prevent<00:04:23.640> this<00:04:23.880> carbon<00:04:24.750> buildup

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
how can we prevent this carbon buildup

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.860 
how can we prevent this carbon buildup
be<00:04:25.500> prevented<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.340> few<00:04:26.610> different<00:04:26.910> ways<00:04:27.030> the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
be prevented in a few different ways the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.900 
be prevented in a few different ways the
most<00:04:28.140> common<00:04:28.710> one<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.100> most<00:04:29.250> popular<00:04:29.670> use

in the automotive world in the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.690 
in the automotive world in the
aftermarket<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.570> going<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.020> be<00:04:34.140> catch<00:04:34.830> cans<00:04:35.160> so

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
aftermarket is going to be catch cans so

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.760 
aftermarket is going to be catch cans so
what<00:04:35.850> if<00:04:35.940> catch<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.450> does<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:37.020> takes<00:04:37.200> your<00:04:37.380> PCV

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
what if catch can does it takes your PCV

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.650 
what if catch can does it takes your PCV
system<00:04:38.130> and<00:04:39.410> reroutes<00:04:40.410> your<00:04:40.740> PCV<00:04:41.130> airflow<00:04:41.970> to

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
where go through a condensing can before

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.960 
where go through a condensing can before
it<00:04:46.170> goes<00:04:46.380> into<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.130> engine<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.700> what<00:04:47.820> that

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
it goes into the engine and what that

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.190 
it goes into the engine and what that
does<00:04:48.180> is<00:04:48.420> as<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.720> goes<00:04:48.840> through<00:04:49.170> that

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
does is as it goes through that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.340 
does is as it goes through that
condensing<00:04:50.070> cam<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.970> will<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.420> condense

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
condensing cam it will then condense

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.070 
condensing cam it will then condense
that<00:04:52.470> those<00:04:52.950> gases<00:04:53.520> all<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:54.210> heavy<00:04:54.450> stuff

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that those gases all the heavy stuff

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.750 
that those gases all the heavy stuff
will<00:04:55.350> sink<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.860> bottom<00:04:55.890> so<00:04:56.370> you'll<00:04:56.520> it'll

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
will sink to the bottom so you'll it'll

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.560 
will sink to the bottom so you'll it'll
be<00:04:56.970> full<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.330> like<00:04:57.510> oil<00:04:57.720> type<00:04:58.110> sludge<00:04:58.470> water

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
be full of like oil type sludge water

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.880 
be full of like oil type sludge water
fuel<00:05:00.570> vapors<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.200> bunch<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.530> other<00:05:01.650> nasty

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
fuel vapors and a bunch of other nasty

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.950 
fuel vapors and a bunch of other nasty
stuff<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.580> here<00:05:03.120> we'll<00:05:03.270> show<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.450> an<00:05:03.630> example

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
stuff and here we'll show you an example

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.090 
stuff and here we'll show you an example
of<00:05:04.200> what<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.470> looks<00:05:04.650> like<00:05:04.770> when<00:05:04.980> you're

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
of what it looks like when you're

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:14.350 
of what it looks like when you're
dumping<00:05:05.880> out<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.060> catch<00:05:06.330> can

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.899 

so<00:05:15.680> there<00:05:16.680> are<00:05:16.710> other<00:05:16.860> options<00:05:17.159> associated

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
so there are other options associated

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.670 
so there are other options associated
with<00:05:17.999> that<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:18.330> there<00:05:19.050> are<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.169> lot<00:05:19.319> of<00:05:19.439> people

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
with that is there are a lot of people

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.439 
with that is there are a lot of people
who<00:05:20.089> run<00:05:22.129> try<00:05:23.129> to<00:05:23.189> run<00:05:23.369> some<00:05:23.580> chemicals<00:05:24.029> for

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
who run try to run some chemicals for

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.059 
who run try to run some chemicals for
example<00:05:24.509> seafoam<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.319> things<00:05:25.619> like<00:05:25.770> that

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
example seafoam and things like that

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.700 
example seafoam and things like that
we<00:05:26.999> don't<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.389> any<00:05:27.539> claims<00:05:27.869> that<00:05:28.139> will<00:05:28.289> that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
we don't have any claims that will that

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:40.559 
your problem it doesn't mean that you

your problem it doesn't mean that you
will<00:05:40.680> never<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:41.039> carbon<00:05:41.430> buildup<00:05:41.639> what<00:05:41.819> it

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
will never have carbon buildup what it

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.850 
will never have carbon buildup what it
means<00:05:42.119> is<00:05:42.300> that<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.869> will<00:05:42.930> help<00:05:43.199> slow<00:05:43.529> down<00:05:43.559> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
means is that it will help slow down the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.829 
means is that it will help slow down the
process<00:05:44.069> and<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:44.939> you'll<00:05:45.089> catch<00:05:45.240> a<00:05:45.389> lot<00:05:45.569> more

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
process and so you'll catch a lot more

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.329 
process and so you'll catch a lot more
of<00:05:45.960> those<00:05:46.050> contaminants<00:05:46.800> before<00:05:46.889> they<00:05:47.219> get
