00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
work and this happened pretty

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.699 
work and this happened pretty
aggressively<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.950> us<00:02:10.099> after<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.910> 911<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.989> a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
year and that really took a slow down

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.090 
year and that really took a slow down
here<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:47.060> 2009<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.519> much<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.549> our<00:02:51.100> new

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
here in in 2009 because much of our new

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.800 
here in in 2009 because much of our new
store<00:02:52.280> portfolio<00:02:52.489> was<00:02:53.180> built<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.600> new

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
store portfolio was built on new

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.350 
store portfolio was built on new
construction<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.590> that's<00:02:55.580> really<00:02:55.730> come<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
construction and that's really come to a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.509 
construction and that's really come to a
standstill<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.650> had<00:02:57.769> to<00:02:57.860> slow<00:02:58.069> down<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
standstill so we had to slow down and

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.920 
standstill so we had to slow down and
figure<00:02:58.730> out<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.180> were<00:02:59.269> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.480> do<00:02:59.660> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
figure out what we were going to do and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.710 
figure out what we were going to do and
but<00:03:00.290> now<00:03:00.500> we<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.799> opportunities<00:03:01.489> for<00:03:02.330> us<00:03:02.450> in

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
but now we see opportunities for us in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.070 
but now we see opportunities for us in
bacon<00:03:03.349> existing<00:03:03.830> space<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.750> we<00:03:05.750> think<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.049> can

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
bacon existing space and we think we can

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.199 
bacon existing space and we think we can
crank<00:03:06.410> our<00:03:06.620> program<00:03:07.100> right<00:03:07.280> back<00:03:07.489> up<00:03:07.730> because

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
crank our program right back up because

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.300 
crank our program right back up because
we're<00:03:08.540> aiming<00:03:08.660> towards<00:03:09.140> us<00:03:09.320> 600<00:03:09.769> stores<00:03:10.070> in

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
we're aiming towards us 600 stores in

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.970 
we're aiming towards us 600 stores in
the<00:03:10.430> United<00:03:10.730> States<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.380> expansion
