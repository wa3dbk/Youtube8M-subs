00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.500
 here we see the winding see 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.800
 snapped ready us case 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.840
 open type bearings necessary 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.180
 will lubricate the bearings we have covered 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.590
 on one side only 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:58.780
 bad car we can help little 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.780
 so we still have a little bit of a reason 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.879
 set 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 by tags 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 cheese 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.300
 so please do not have to sit down 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:03.470
 then reinvent all, leaving these 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.959
 planochki for further consolidation 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.640
 I hear them it will be easier to fix 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.640
 the place we need 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.560
 put together the engine now try it 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.560
 run 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:51.010
 you can hear how the bearing can handle 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.150
 180 watt cosine fi engines 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.440
 09 1350 revolutions per minute 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:04.470
 current and a half ampere efficiency 60 percent 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.470
 condenser 6 microfarad 600 pounds
