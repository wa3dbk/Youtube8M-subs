00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.250
 all life 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:20.880
 as the children see making the shirt 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.930
 of memes four options ten years 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.930
 with kimi says 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.640
 director of who teaches you to dance 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 and I also wonder what good to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 see what your dance is your hip hop art 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.469
 good 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.530
 my dear in front is the best of the 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.530
 lots 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 does not exist 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.300
 Y 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 so accounts 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.740
 one 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 m 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.630
 with them 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.880
 dylan 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.030
 wieland here I am will say 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.530
 but it's nice in front of 10 years old and you've 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.530
 danced spectacularly 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:45.019
 I think I think if you had 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.719
 another jacket or a clothes that was more 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.780
 mass your body if you had noticed more 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.249
 those movements that you did for the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.230
 last movement that exists with the 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.650
 shoulders I think it's like he takes them out 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.650
 little bit 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.469
 I'm going to make a girl something like that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.019
 I was impressed but she was with the 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:06.510
 without sleeves and obviously that's why I found 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.450
 note that you did it but almost did not 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.810
 You could notice but you did it and it's 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.889
 really very beautiful what you just 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.889
 do that is an energy 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.450
 but I think if I had the 

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:25.680
 jacket if I had noticed under a 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.440
 T-shirt I do not know I'm suggesting nothing more 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.520
 but I loved it is 10 years old and what 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.520
 you did great 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:43.389
 in four years you have to be great a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.520
 great dancer a great dancer I think 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.289
 that with that is born because a lot 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.930
 people who can take so many 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.440
 dance courses and just do not learn 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:57.880
 nothing and your teacher is here data 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.270
 teacher to have between king and the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.270
 teacher 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.540
 He had a hard time teaching him and that 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.590
 learn everything because he has a lot 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.590
 exact talent 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.260
 How long ago did you teach him 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.660
 four months ago doing months 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.030
 pretty that well very well obviously 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.090
 you need to perfect every little thing 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.380
 because time is what will make you a 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.190
 super dancer but for now you are a 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.120
 good dancer 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.120

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.040
 dylan 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:52.370
 7 the surprises that I took because 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.370
 when they showed up and I dance it 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.570
 yes 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.419
 they forced him to come this 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.970
 boy just gave the mom but now 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.100
 when the music started it was one thing that 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.630
 he left at 12 am as the 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.990
 recharged batteries that I was 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.430
 electrocuting there on stage 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.430
 very, very, very good 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.070
 we have had not only this year but 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.110
 in the previous audition we have had 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.850
 this participants who have done what 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.729
 had I think that you also do that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.090
 style of dancing different shapes and 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.150
 dad and popping there are a lot and always 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.350
 they see it to someone friendly central and more 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.180
 great all of that I 've never seen it like that 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.729
 a child at least has not presented 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.190
 that way and you do it very well and to me 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.490
