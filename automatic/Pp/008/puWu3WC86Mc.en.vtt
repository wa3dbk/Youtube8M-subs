 this is a little game where it can be 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.880
 interesting I think a subscriber 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.860
 told me that he had already played 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.110
 so gambling is that the game must not be 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.370
 so bad that I do not really like it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.419
 you say it because I do not like being 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.580
 sincere and it's not because the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.710

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.210
