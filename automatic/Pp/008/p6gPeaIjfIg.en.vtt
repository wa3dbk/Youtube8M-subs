recreating<00:00:06.810> things<00:00:07.140> from<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.649> Lego<00:00:07.830> ideas

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
recreating things from the Lego ideas

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:19.370 
recreating things from the Lego ideas
book<00:00:11.330> today<00:00:13.370> with<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.519> airplane<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:18.380> did

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
book today with this airplane here I did

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.349 
book today with this airplane here I did
have<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.650> swap<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> couple<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.640> colors<00:00:20.850> just

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
have to swap out a couple of colors just

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
have to swap out a couple of colors just
because<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.630> didn't<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.529> right<00:00:22.650> pieces

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
because I didn't have the right pieces

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
because I didn't have the right pieces
and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> right<00:00:23.430> colors<00:00:23.760> which<00:00:24.029> you'll<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.240> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and the right colors which you'll see in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.820 
and the right colors which you'll see in
a<00:00:24.600> minute<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:26.869> this<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.560> very

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a minute and this was actually very

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.359 
a minute and this was actually very
challenging<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.880> um<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.099> stuff

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
challenging to do um you know this stuff

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.530 
challenging to do um you know this stuff
is<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> easy<00:00:33.320> but<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.700> challenging

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
is kind of easy but the challenging

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.880 
is kind of easy but the challenging
thing<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> can't<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.469> what's<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
thing is you can't see what's in the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
thing is you can't see what's in the
middle<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> that's<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
middle and that's kind of like the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
middle and that's kind of like the
foundation<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> plane<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
foundation of the plane so you have to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.869 
foundation of the plane so you have to
kind<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.719> build<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> sections<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
kind of like build in sections here and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
kind of like build in sections here and
then<00:00:44.969> somehow<00:00:45.600> piece<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.200> together<00:00:48.469> was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
then somehow piece it all together was

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
then somehow piece it all together was
finally<00:00:49.920> able<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> today<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.199> let's

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
finally able to do it today so let's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.680 
finally able to do it today so let's
take<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> look

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.990 

look<00:00:59.690> off<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.290> side<00:01:00.560> here<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.800> here's<00:01:04.700> the

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
look off to the side here and here's the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.280 
look off to the side here and here's the
biplane<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:11.510> know<00:01:11.600> these<00:01:11.780> pieces<00:01:12.020> are

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
biplane you know these pieces are

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.260 
biplane you know these pieces are
supposed<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.650> be<00:01:12.800> red<00:01:12.980> and<00:01:13.250> sore<00:01:13.550> these<00:01:13.820> and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
supposed to be red and sore these and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.720 
supposed to be red and sore these and
these<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:14.840> didn't<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.710> any<00:01:15.890> in<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:16.490> color

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
these but didn't have any in that color

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.960 
these but didn't have any in that color
so<00:01:17.030> I<00:01:17.330> had<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.140> improvise<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:19.550> then<00:01:19.760> these<00:01:19.910> are

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
so I had to improvise and then these are

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.400 
so I had to improvise and then these are
supposed<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.420> be<00:01:20.570> black

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.020 

propellers<00:01:24.410> a<00:01:24.470> little<00:01:24.920> bit<00:01:25.040> different<00:01:28.030> see

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
propellers a little bit different see

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.490 
propellers a little bit different see
works<00:01:29.300> out<00:01:29.510> pretty<00:01:29.780> well<00:01:30.430> very<00:01:31.430> tricky<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:33.350> put

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
works out pretty well very tricky to put

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.200 
works out pretty well very tricky to put
this<00:01:33.650> together<00:01:34.570> because<00:01:35.570> um<00:01:36.400> until<00:01:37.400> these<00:01:37.790> are

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
this together because um until these are

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.080 
this together because um until these are
attached<00:01:38.600> together<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:40.070> wings<00:01:40.340> are<00:01:40.640> very

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
attached together the wings are very

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.920 
attached together the wings are very
very<00:01:41.450> fragile<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.760> I<00:01:43.760> had<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.150> whole<00:01:44.540> part<00:01:44.810> on

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
very fragile and I had a whole part on

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.650 
very fragile and I had a whole part on
me<00:01:45.080> about<00:01:45.320> 20<00:01:45.650> times<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:47.090> once<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.420> get<00:01:47.540> them

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
me about 20 times but once you get them

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.210 
me about 20 times but once you get them
locked<00:01:47.810> into<00:01:48.080> place<00:01:48.260> they<00:01:48.650> lock<00:01:48.800> in<00:01:49.040> with

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
locked into place they lock in with

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.120 
locked into place they lock in with
these<00:01:49.369> two<00:01:50.270> pins<00:01:50.510> here<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.770> then<00:01:51.890> there<00:01:52.040> is

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
these two pins here and then there is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.230 
these two pins here and then there is
also<00:01:52.310> support<00:01:52.970> there<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:55.640> gets<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.000> lot

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
also support there it gets a lot

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.470 
also support there it gets a lot
sturdier

Inge<00:02:06.440> plates<00:02:07.440> connecting<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.490> backend

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
Inge plates connecting the backend

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:19.340 
Inge plates connecting the backend
together<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:18.000> was<00:02:18.450> actually<00:02:18.660> missing<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
together and I was actually missing a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.800 
together and I was actually missing a
white<00:02:19.590> hinge<00:02:20.040> plate<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.670> I'd<00:02:21.090> use<00:02:21.390> black<00:02:23.810> kind

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
white hinge plate so I'd use black kind

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.800 
white hinge plate so I'd use black kind
of<00:02:24.870> sucks<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.410> oh<00:02:25.590> well<00:02:26.480> turned<00:02:27.480> out<00:02:27.630> pretty

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
of sucks but oh well turned out pretty

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:40.850 
of sucks but oh well turned out pretty
well<00:02:30.380> take<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> final<00:02:31.710> look<00:02:31.860> at<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:40.260> same<00:02:40.500> angle

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
well take a final look at the same angle

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.289 
well take a final look at the same angle
of<00:02:40.890> lips<00:02:42.200> color

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.959 

so<00:02:51.299> yeah<00:02:51.859> that's<00:02:52.859> a<00:02:53.159> that's<00:02:53.969> pretty<00:02:54.150> much<00:02:54.390> it

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
so yeah that's a that's pretty much it

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.339

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
hopefully I'll be doing some more of

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.479 
hopefully I'll be doing some more of
these<00:02:58.439> fairly<00:02:59.129> soon<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:01.400> thanks<00:03:02.400> for
