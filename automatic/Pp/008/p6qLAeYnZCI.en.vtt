available in the United States that's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.550 
available in the United States that's
crash<00:00:16.890> tested<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.760> dogs<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.230> simple

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
crash tested for dogs so it's a simple

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.590 
crash tested for dogs so it's a simple
step<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.980> harness<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.760> important<00:00:21.180> parts<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
step in harness the important parts that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.730 
step in harness the important parts that
harness<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.890> does<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.460> plastic<00:00:24.180> buckles

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
harness are it does have plastic buckles

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.519 
harness are it does have plastic buckles
to<00:00:25.740> attach<00:00:26.099> around<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> dog<00:00:26.990> but<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> weight

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to attach around the dog but the weight

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.519 
to attach around the dog but the weight
bearing<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.220> case<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.730> crash<00:00:30.529> weight-bearing

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
bearing in case of crash weight-bearing

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
bearing in case of crash weight-bearing
things<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.790> metal<00:00:33.149> rings<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
things are these metal rings here and I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
things are these metal rings here and I
will<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.590> leave<00:00:34.829> them<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.100> straight<00:00:35.399> how

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
will have a leave them and straight how

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.209 
will have a leave them and straight how
to<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.360> market<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> simple

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to put it on the market so it's a simple

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.760 
to put it on the market so it's a simple
step<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.670> harness<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> mean<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
step in harness so that mean to just

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.729 
step in harness so that mean to just
lift<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.370> dog's<00:00:41.579> feet<00:00:42.030> in

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.549 

and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> clip<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> over<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> back

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.099 

and<00:00:55.559> these<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.519> non-weight-bearing<00:00:57.109> buckles

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and these are non-weight-bearing buckles

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.240 
and these are non-weight-bearing buckles
here<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.530> doesn't<00:00:58.769> matter<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> they're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
here so it doesn't matter that they're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.399 
here so it doesn't matter that they're
plastic<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.690> weight<00:01:00.839> bearing<00:01:01.050> part

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
plastic this is the weight bearing part

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.010 
plastic this is the weight bearing part
this<00:01:04.409> attaches<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.939> restraint<00:01:06.600> strap

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
this attaches to the restraint strap

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
my little hook here is narrow enough

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.180 
my little hook here is narrow enough
that<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.220> slip<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> side<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:55.190> can

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
that if I slip it to the side I can

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.830 
that if I slip it to the side I can
finagle<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.670> through<00:01:56.970> there<00:01:57.179> without<00:01:57.420> having

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
finagle it through there without having

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.729 
finagle it through there without having
to<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:59.009> unscrew<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.670> each<00:01:59.879> time

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
to to unscrew it each time

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:05.990 
to to unscrew it each time
and<00:02:01.739> that<00:02:02.069> gets<00:02:02.250> buckled<00:02:04.610> leaving<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.759> which

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and that gets buckled leaving this which

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.089 
and that gets buckled leaving this which
is<00:02:06.149> an<00:02:06.270> adjustable<00:02:06.720> restraint<00:02:07.200> strap<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.009> I'll

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
is an adjustable restraint strap so I'll

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.720 
is an adjustable restraint strap so I'll
get<00:02:08.250> Molly<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> car<00:02:08.879> now

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.199 

I<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:14.450> when<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.720> lay<00:02:14.870> down<00:02:14.900> good<00:02:15.500> boy<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:17.030> then

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
I like when to lay down good boy so then

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.050 
I like when to lay down good boy so then
I<00:02:17.240> take<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:18.010> which<00:02:19.010> opens<00:02:19.489> up<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.819> way

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
I take this which opens up this way

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.640 
I take this which opens up this way
which<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.480> little<00:02:20.540> bit<00:02:20.900> difficult<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.620> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
which is a little bit difficult for a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.360 
which is a little bit difficult for a
limited<00:02:22.040> mobility<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.940> sometimes<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.200> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
limited mobility so sometimes I have a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.000 
limited mobility so sometimes I have a
easier<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.489> use<00:02:25.640> carabiner<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.300> here<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.860> goes

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
easier to use carabiner and here it goes

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.030 
easier to use carabiner and here it goes
around<00:02:28.280> both<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.940> attaches<00:02:29.599> like<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:30.040> then

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
around both and attaches like that then

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.400 
around both and attaches like that then
you<00:02:31.160> safe
