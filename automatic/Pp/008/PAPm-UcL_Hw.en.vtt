and also question of the day is what are

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
and also question of the day is what are
your<00:00:23.789> thoughts<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.300> need<00:00:24.480> speed<00:00:24.810> after

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
your thoughts are need speed after

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.019 
your thoughts are need speed after
seeing<00:00:25.650> all<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.130> information<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
seeing all of this information and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
seeing all of this information and
gameplay<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.779> e3<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:28.680> you've<00:00:28.800> seen<00:00:28.980> already

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
gameplay at e3 if you've seen already

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040 
gameplay at e3 if you've seen already
otherwise<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.150> sort<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.480> search<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
otherwise you can sort of search you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
otherwise you can sort of search you
want<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> find<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:31.859> anyway<00:00:32.130> first<00:00:32.550> off

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
want to find some more anyway first off

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
want to find some more anyway first off
we<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.270> some<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> gameplay

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we actually have some of the gameplay

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
we actually have some of the gameplay
from<00:00:34.170> e3<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.730> drift

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
from e3 and this is actually a drift

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.970 
from e3 and this is actually a drift
attack<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> guys<00:00:37.739> may<00:00:37.950> be

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
attack and some of you guys may be

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
attack and some of you guys may be
thinking<00:00:38.219> although<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.879> kind<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> weird<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
thinking although it's kind of weird the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.740 
thinking although it's kind of weird the
camera<00:00:40.649> angle<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.450> confirmed

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
camera angle it was actually confirmed

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
camera angle it was actually confirmed
that<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.469> sort<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.890> gameplay<00:00:44.340> trailer

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that for this sort of gameplay trailer

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
that for this sort of gameplay trailer
the<00:00:45.090> camera<00:00:45.510> angle<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.930> added<00:00:46.170> while<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> was

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the camera angle they added while it was

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
the camera angle they added while it was
drifting<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.670> an<00:00:47.760> action<00:00:48.180> camera<00:00:48.329> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
drifting was just an action camera that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.240 
drifting was just an action camera that
they've<00:00:48.809> added<00:00:49.260> themselves<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
they've added themselves so it's not in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
they've added themselves so it's not in
the<00:00:50.309> actual<00:00:50.430> game<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> good<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.199> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the actual game which is good to look so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.830 
the actual game which is good to look so
it<00:00:52.440> looks<00:00:52.620> sort<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> weird<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> also<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it looks sort of weird this is also a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.529 
it looks sort of weird this is also a
drift<00:00:55.079> attack<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.850> normal<00:00:56.850> driving<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
drift attack so normal driving in this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.610 
drift attack so normal driving in this
is<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.230> normal<00:00:58.469> you're

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
is actually going to be normal you're

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
is actually going to be normal you're
not<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.010> those<00:00:59.250> drift<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.879> turn

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
not going to have those drift to turn

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
not going to have those drift to turn
physics<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> were<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> last<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:02.129> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
physics that were in the last need for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950 
physics that were in the last need for
speed<00:01:02.609> rivals<00:01:02.640> game<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:03.660> literally

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
speed rivals game there's literally

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
speed rivals game there's literally
loads<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.530> stuff<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.860> customize<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
loads of stuff you can customize on the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
loads of stuff you can customize on the
car<00:01:05.850> you'll<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> actual<00:01:07.560> video<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
car you'll see on the actual video the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
car you'll see on the actual video the
person<00:01:08.670> goes<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.360> car<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
person goes around the car on all the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 
person goes around the car on all the
saw<00:01:10.380> different<00:01:10.740> points<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.580> edit<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
saw different points you can edit on the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
saw different points you can edit on the
car<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> wheels<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.350> bumpers<00:01:13.799> there's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
car like the wheels the bumpers there's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
car like the wheels the bumpers there's
literally<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.580> many<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.180> anywhere

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
literally so many you can go anywhere

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
literally so many you can go anywhere
and<00:01:15.750> edit<00:01:16.049> anything<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:16.950> sick<00:01:17.310> all

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and edit anything and it looks sick all

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.969 
and edit anything and it looks sick all
of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> customization<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.810> think<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
of the customization I think a lot of it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
of the customization I think a lot of it
is<00:01:20.130> actual<00:01:20.549> real<00:01:20.990> modifications<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.259> on

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
is actual real modifications that are on

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
is actual real modifications that are on
real<00:01:22.680> cars<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.220> real<00:01:23.520> life<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> rocket

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
real cars in real life like the rocket
