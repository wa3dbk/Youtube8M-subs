00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.379
 is considered the cultured norm to use the term 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.590
 why this is a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.780
 question is actually quite incidentally 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.310
 today has been much talked about including me 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 I received some emails from students who 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 forwarded emails from an alleged 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 teacher from rio de janeiro saying that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
 there is no student so there is no 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.699
 president 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 I say we have to have too much 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.779
 careful what we receive 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 we must know the suitability of the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 The sources we are looking for here you know 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 that you have an anonymous source 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.660
 but not every location you have this source 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 so the first thing I did until 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 when I received this 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 student went to look at dictionaries so that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.690
 no problem I looked four 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 employees between them the wise the silver 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 good 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 the sacconi and opt for one because it is what 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.000
 you usually use the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.469
 and look what appears in the knee 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.750
 presidency 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.420
 woman who performs the function of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.030
 President is in the old if this is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 registered in sacconi no aurÃ©lio nuno 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 silveira good not online 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 this is therefore grammatical and the norm 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.189
 cultured 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.950
 What happens is that much is discussed 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.280
 sometimes this question of origin is not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 with a study that says that the president 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.930
 emerged as the president's wife because 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 there is no expression first lady 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.240
 then when the expression first lady 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.829
 the president was used there 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 turned the UN into actually the president sex 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.150
 female and president is common disease 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.000
 Can use for man to woman 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 there is a woman- only president for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 this origin many consider that the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.479
 Chair piece slightly lower than 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.550
 president and choose the word 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.580
 President, but it is 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.220
 our president or our president 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.400
 she prefers to be called president 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.910
 why parents raise this issue of 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.010
 woman that feminine matter of a 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.990
 woman a first woman occupy this 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.330
 charge no problem there either 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.850
 emphasize this however if you choose to 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 president and president also 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.750
 is bad 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.900
 that is at the end of the day we can 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.370
 use the president dilma or the president 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.370
 It turns out so much does
