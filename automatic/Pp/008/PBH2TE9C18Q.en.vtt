00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.570
 oil tnk oil is produced by western 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.790
 technologies from imported components 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.059
 approved by European automakers 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.609
 good morning 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.800
 stainless metal chrome was opened in 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.050
 late 18th century and to cover the details 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.850
 car began to use it in the 20's 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.320
 years of the last century since 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.480
 the popularity of this method 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.689
 decorating and protecting car parts 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.939
 The chrome of your mod has grown significantly 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.100
 steel mirror grilles 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.350
 running boards and even roof racks 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.660
 if we form a part of your car 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.940
 spoiled and it is integral 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.630
 part of the decor is impossible to buy 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.059
 get upset 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.890
 it can be restored restoration 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.760
 As a rule, the process is more time consuming and 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.579
 expensive 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.670
 than simple chrome parts 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.710
 last did not then no motorcycle 38 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.750
 all that was once chrome became 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:06.829
 no chrome to the world and no 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.569
 Well, if installed by the way chrome 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.359
 extremely harmful to human health 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:13.850
 90th chrome procedure was recognized 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.590
 carcinogen so now for giving 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.229
 surface perfect silver 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.969
 colors used by niki once was 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.590
 only one color available 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.420
 silver modern technology 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 allow to give chrome 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.490
 surface almost any shade 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.289
 more precisely the necessary shade gives varnish 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.899
 adding dyes because 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.179
 a protective layer of varnish covers all the details 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.189
 by the way by chrome now with 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.380
 the need is covered only by the working 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.770
 surface details just imagine 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.679
 to myself 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.969
 chromium thickness is only 1 2 microns but at 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.770
 this makes their chrome plating 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.889
 metal surface more solid 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.920
 hot raises wear resistance 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.799
 machined parts 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.560
 it is their lifetime now 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.150
 several ways to impart a surface 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 silver or golden shade for 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.299
 plastic parts 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 usually use the meters method 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.830
 chrome plating for quality and durability 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.310
 this coating is not inferior to what was done 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.470
 electroplated in the first stage 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 meta chrome plating refined part 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.730
 handle special varieties 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.830
 it corrodes the surface layer of plastic 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.840
 or other material his case 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.290
 rough it needs for education 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 parts of microcracks which will then 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.030
 pile up 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.550
 silver coatings form 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.400
 after the coating is applied detail 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.500
 need to dry well and leave at 48 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.270
 hours during this time 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.030
 chrome surfaces can not 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.740
 touch but good old electroplating 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.480
 nobody canceled most 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.790
 metal parts processed 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.080
 in such a way that it was 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.300
 clearly you covered 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.090
 ordinary tablespoon several 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:58.050
 kinds of metals and that's what happened in 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:02.040
 we ended up with gold 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.430
 the boundaries are clearly a layer of copper as in any 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.230
 business 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 chrome plating is important experience and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
 professionalism therefore choosing gray in 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.890
 which one do you want to chrome off 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.870
 details be careful while you 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.060
 care about the appearance of the car is not 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.890
 Forget about motor protection for him. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.080
 by the way is suitable engine oil TNC 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.730
 magnum it is produced in favor 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.500
 imported component imported 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.390
 synthetic base and additives 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.910
 providing the European level 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.010
 qualities on this i'm all beautiful to you 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.010
 main road and over the green
