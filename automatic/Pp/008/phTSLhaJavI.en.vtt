chocolate than what they advertised as

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749

on<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> planet<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.829> Apple<00:01:44.159> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

unwarranted this was just banana
chocolate<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.549> work<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.820> lot

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
chocolate I think that would work a lot
better<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.840> apple<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.409> comes<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
better the apple kind of comes in and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
better the apple kind of comes in and
gives<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.100> extra<00:01:50.399> unneeded<00:01:50.790> sweetness<00:01:51.390> yeah

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
gives an extra unneeded sweetness yeah

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.450 
gives an extra unneeded sweetness yeah
