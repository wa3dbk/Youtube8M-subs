00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 wait for it to dry 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.310

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.470
 the whole nail also on the sides 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.530
 review the passage on all nails 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.650

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.109
 stretch the figure until you get a 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.109

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.890
