00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.070 
bounce left and right but because the
ceiling<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.760> like<00:01:56.660> lower<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.410> not<00:01:57.860> lower<00:01:59.080> like

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.650 
ceiling is like lower and not lower like
it<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:01.310> disproportionate<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:02.300> what<00:02:02.450> it

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
it it's disproportionate to what it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.070 
it it's disproportionate to what it
should<00:02:02.690> be

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
should be

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.560 
should be
anyway<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.650> monkeys<00:02:03.980> will<00:02:04.220> be<00:02:04.570> bouncing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
anyway the monkeys will be bouncing

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.420 
anyway the monkeys will be bouncing
closer<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.320> than<00:02:06.500> you'd<00:02:06.650> probably<00:02:06.890> like

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
closer to you than you'd probably like

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.950 

don't<00:02:21.050> know<00:02:21.140> why<00:02:21.350> 3<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> pretty<00:02:22.220> easy

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
don't know why 3 is a pretty easy

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.230 
don't know why 3 is a pretty easy
act<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.110> think<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.500> easy<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.940> think<00:02:25.940> most<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
act I think it's easy I think most of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.080 
act I think it's easy I think most of
Wiley<00:02:26.600> Tower<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.140> C<00:02:28.010> Wiley<00:02:28.310> Tower<00:02:28.520> isn't<00:02:28.940> about

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
Wiley Tower is C Wiley Tower isn't about

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.090 
Wiley Tower is C Wiley Tower isn't about
being<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.870> hardest<00:02:30.110> game<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.770> series

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
being the hardest game in the series

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.040 
being the hardest game in the series
it's<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.460> about<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.940> mean<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.390> can<00:02:32.600> be<00:02:32.810> if<00:02:32.960> you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
it's just about I mean it can be if you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.050 
it's just about I mean it can be if you
don't<00:02:33.230> bring<00:02:33.440> any<00:02:33.620> weapons<00:02:33.980> into<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.520> mix<00:02:34.790> I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
don't bring any weapons into the mix I

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.410 
don't bring any weapons into the mix I
mean<00:02:36.340> technically<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.610> could<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.120> go<00:02:38.270> in

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
mean technically you could just go in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.270 
mean technically you could just go in
with<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.690> Mega<00:02:38.900> Buster<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.530> try<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.070> see<00:02:40.190> how

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
with the Mega Buster and try and see how

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.980 
with the Mega Buster and try and see how
you<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.520> with<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.480> could<00:02:41.630> beat<00:02:41.810> it

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
you do with that and you could beat it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.200 
you do with that and you could beat it
it'd<00:02:42.740> be<00:02:42.860> hard<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.160> fuck<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.760> could<00:02:43.910> do<00:02:44.090> it

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
it'd be hard as fuck but you could do it

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.150 
it'd be hard as fuck but you could do it
you<00:02:44.780> could<00:02:44.840> do<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.040> cheese

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.130 

so<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:49.910> people<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.390> people<00:02:50.690> want<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> challenge

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
so if people if people want to challenge

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.010 
so if people if people want to challenge
then<00:02:51.740> they<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.160> try<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.400> claim<00:02:52.810> wiley<00:02:53.810> tower

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
then they can try and claim wiley tower

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.510 
then they can try and claim wiley tower
without<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.470> make<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:54.830> with<00:02:55.040> only<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.370> Mega

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
without a make up with only the Mega

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.220 
without a make up with only the Mega
Buster<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.510> much<00:02:56.690> harder<00:02:56.720> game

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
Buster and it's a much harder game

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.930 
Buster and it's a much harder game
definitely<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.740> know<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:00.890> love<00:03:01.190> any<00:03:01.430> game

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
definitely but you know I love any game

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.730 
definitely but you know I love any game
that<00:03:02.150> lets<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.540> mean<00:03:02.870> they<00:03:02.960> should<00:03:03.140> do<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> sequel

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
that lets I mean they should do a sequel

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.410 
that lets I mean they should do a sequel
to<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:03.980> they<00:03:04.190> should<00:03:04.370> do<00:03:04.490> like<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> wily<00:03:05.180> tower

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
to this they should do like a wily tower

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.810 
to this they should do like a wily tower
-<00:03:05.750> or<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.430> wily<00:03:07.430> Wars<00:03:07.610> -<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.300> know<00:03:08.860> hell<00:03:09.860> now

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
- or a wily Wars - you know hell now

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.550 
- or a wily Wars - you know hell now
