of these stylers underneath la looks
shellin<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:56.970> tried<00:03:57.239> them<00:03:57.420> without<00:03:57.750> la<00:03:58.140> look

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
shellin I tried them without la look

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.910 
shellin I tried them without la look
still<00:03:58.739> today<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.850> was<00:04:00.000> without<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.200> gel<00:04:01.799> on

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
still today this was without a gel on

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.820 
still today this was without a gel on
top<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.850> really<00:04:03.030> wasn't<00:04:03.450> enough<00:04:03.959> hold<00:04:04.500> for

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
top and it really wasn't enough hold for

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.750 
top and it really wasn't enough hold for
my<00:04:04.920> hair<00:04:05.870> because<00:04:06.870> as<00:04:07.410> my<00:04:08.040> hair<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.340> drying<00:04:08.579> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
my hair because as my hair is drying I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.509 
my hair because as my hair is drying I
could<00:04:08.970> see<00:04:09.269> little<00:04:10.110> flyaways<00:04:10.709> forming<00:04:11.190> and

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
could see little flyaways forming and

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.780 
could see little flyaways forming and
patches<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.480> fuzz<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.739> did<00:04:13.950> apply<00:04:14.340> like<00:04:14.760> a

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
patches of fuzz and I did apply like a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.880 
patches of fuzz and I did apply like a
liberal<00:04:15.299> amount<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.780> these<00:04:15.930> um<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.590> tried

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
liberal amount of these um and I tried

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.400 
liberal amount of these um and I tried
it<00:04:17.010> twice<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.519> they<00:04:18.299> really<00:04:18.750> just<00:04:18.959> weren't

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
it twice and they really just weren't

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.500 
it twice and they really just weren't
enough<00:04:19.680> hope<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.190> hair<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.820> soft<00:04:21.180> hold

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
enough hope for my hair it's a soft hold

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.750 
enough hope for my hair it's a soft hold
cream<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.200> not<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.440> gel<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.370> wasn't<00:04:23.669> really

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
cream it's not a gel so I wasn't really

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650 
cream it's not a gel so I wasn't really
expecting<00:04:24.090> that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
expecting that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.910 
expecting that
but<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.960> did<00:04:25.140> start<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.380> give<00:04:25.530> them<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.740> chance

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
but I did start to give them a chance

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.250 
but I did start to give them a chance
now<00:04:26.250> they<00:04:26.430> worked<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.940> liked<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.870> way<00:04:28.020> they

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
now they worked I liked the way they

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.460

this<00:04:41.700> one<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:42.060> formulated<00:04:42.570> pretty<00:04:42.780> somebody

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
this one is formulated pretty somebody

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.330

the<00:04:43.170> waitlist<00:04:43.440> moisturizing<00:04:43.950> cream<00:04:44.100> just

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
the waitlist moisturizing cream just

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.260 
the waitlist moisturizing cream just
feels<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.910> leave-in<00:04:45.180> cream<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.110> guess<00:04:46.350> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
feels like a leave-in cream I guess and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.060 
feels like a leave-in cream I guess and
then<00:04:48.270> there's<00:04:48.960> definitely<00:04:49.440> some<00:04:49.650> more<00:04:49.800> hold

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
then there's definitely some more hold

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.100 
then there's definitely some more hold
in<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.400> soft<00:04:50.640> hold<00:04:50.940> cream<00:04:51.450> because<00:04:51.900> it's<00:04:52.050> a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
in the soft hold cream because it's a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.320 
in the soft hold cream because it's a
soft<00:04:52.320> hold<00:04:52.530> cream<00:04:53.960> but<00:04:55.700> both<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:56.730> these<00:04:56.940> have

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
soft hold cream but both of these have

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.060 
soft hold cream but both of these have
mineral<00:04:57.900> oil<00:04:58.170> in<00:04:58.410> them<00:04:58.530> which<00:04:58.770> is<00:04:58.890> something

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
mineral oil in them which is something

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.640 
mineral oil in them which is something
that<00:04:59.250> can<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.640> little<00:05:00.030> bit<00:05:00.180> hard<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.930> remove

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that can be a little bit hard to remove

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.800 
that can be a little bit hard to remove
if<00:05:02.010> you're<00:05:02.370> not<00:05:02.640> into<00:05:03.000> using<00:05:03.120> shampoo<00:05:03.570> all<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
if you're not into using shampoo all the

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.800 
if you're not into using shampoo all the
time<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.250> like<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.730> way<00:05:05.850> these<00:05:06.300> products

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
time so I like the way these products

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.030 
time so I like the way these products
made<00:05:06.930> my<00:05:07.110> hair<00:05:07.320> feel<00:05:07.590> it's<00:05:07.950> very<00:05:08.760> soft<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:10.040> it

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
made my hair feel it's very soft and it

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.270 
made my hair feel it's very soft and it
feels<00:05:11.250> very<00:05:11.600> conditioned<00:05:12.600> but<00:05:13.470> they<00:05:13.710> don't

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
feels very conditioned but they don't

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.150 
feels very conditioned but they don't
really<00:05:14.730> have<00:05:14.910> enough<00:05:15.120> coal<00:05:15.300> for<00:05:15.330> my<00:05:15.600> hair<00:05:16.160> my

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
really have enough coal for my hair my

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160 
really have enough coal for my hair my
hair<00:05:17.340> was<00:05:17.460> drinking<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.940> fuzzy<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.630> like<00:05:18.930> put

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
hair was drinking a fuzzy so I like put

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.660 
hair was drinking a fuzzy so I like put
it<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.440> braid<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.680> now<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.160> curls<00:05:20.520> have

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
it in a braid and now the curls have

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.060 
it in a braid and now the curls have
kind<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:20.970> reformed<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.540> little<00:05:21.780> bit<00:05:21.870> better<00:05:22.070> but

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
kind of reformed a little bit better but

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.030 
kind of reformed a little bit better but
um<00:05:23.450> they<00:05:24.450> really<00:05:24.780> weren't<00:05:25.020> gonna<00:05:25.320> dry<00:05:25.620> pretty

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
um they really weren't gonna dry pretty

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.430 
um they really weren't gonna dry pretty
before<00:05:26.280> um<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.840> my<00:05:28.830> it's<00:05:29.070> just<00:05:29.280> like<00:05:30.440> really

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
before um and my it's just like really

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.770 
before um and my it's just like really
soft<00:05:31.800> but<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.310> doesn't<00:05:32.580> have<00:05:32.760> enough<00:05:32.790> hold<00:05:33.450> so

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
soft but it doesn't have enough hold so

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.440 
soft but it doesn't have enough hold so
the<00:05:33.990> curls<00:05:34.260> can<00:05:34.410> really<00:05:34.680> form<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.910> way<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.270> want

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
the curls can really form the way I want

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.070 
the curls can really form the way I want
them<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:37.640> so<00:05:38.640> I<00:05:39.000> think<00:05:39.060> these<00:05:39.360> products<00:05:39.900> might

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
them to so I think these products might

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.420 
them to so I think these products might
be<00:05:40.200> better<00:05:40.350> for<00:05:40.530> someone<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.800> has<00:05:41.010> made<00:05:41.310> me

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
be better for someone that has made me

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.860 
be better for someone that has made me
finer<00:05:41.760> hair<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:43.260> doesn't<00:05:43.470> need<00:05:43.830> as<00:05:44.010> much<00:05:44.190> hold

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
finer hair it doesn't need as much hold

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.900 
finer hair it doesn't need as much hold
so<00:05:45.870> yeah<00:05:46.050> as<00:05:46.320> far<00:05:46.590> as<00:05:46.710> performance<00:05:47.010> goes<00:05:47.430> these

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
so yeah as far as performance goes these

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.420 
so yeah as far as performance goes these
products<00:05:48.300> are<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.750> little<00:05:49.110> iffy<00:05:49.860> for<00:05:49.890> me<00:05:50.190> but

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
products are a little iffy for me but

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.640 
products are a little iffy for me but
like<00:05:50.550> like<00:05:50.850> I<00:05:51.030> really<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.870> most<00:05:52.169> of<00:05:52.260> them<00:05:52.380> and

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
much I didn't notice it too much when I

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.120 
much I didn't notice it too much when I
was<00:06:58.110> just<00:06:58.170> using<00:06:58.350> the<00:06:58.530> leave-in<00:06:58.710> conditioner

just kind of like this is really weird

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.520

because<00:07:04.800> my<00:07:05.630> hair<00:07:06.630> just<00:07:06.870> felt<00:07:07.110> like<00:07:07.260> really

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
because my hair just felt like really

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.170 
because my hair just felt like really
cold<00:07:07.830> and<00:07:08.130> numbing<00:07:08.490> wherever<00:07:08.820> it<00:07:09.000> like

I would probably repurchase this
leave-in<00:07:24.600> conditioner<00:07:26.000> mainly<00:07:27.000> because<00:07:27.210> I

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
leave-in conditioner mainly because I

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.770 
leave-in conditioner mainly because I
like<00:07:29.070> the<00:07:29.220> way<00:07:29.310> it<00:07:29.370> works<00:07:29.580> and<00:07:29.880> it<00:07:30.450> just<00:07:30.630> has

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
like the way it works and it just has

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.480 
like the way it works and it just has
the<00:07:30.930> modem<00:07:31.260> at<00:07:31.380> the<00:07:31.470> comb<00:07:31.650> to<00:07:31.680> them<00:07:31.890> whereas

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:34.590 
I feel like might be a little hard to

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.800 
I feel like might be a little hard to
get<00:07:34.680> out<00:07:34.830> I<00:07:35.160> go<00:07:35.580> back<00:07:35.790> and<00:07:35.940> forth<00:07:36.030> with<00:07:36.480> using
