00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
is one of the small pieces right there I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
is one of the small pieces right there I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
was able to stick my hand down in there

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.550 
was able to stick my hand down in there
and<00:01:41.150> pull<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> bottom<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and pull it out from the bottom but I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.929 
and pull it out from the bottom but I
also<00:01:43.740> managed<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> pull<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
also managed to pull one out from the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.219 
also managed to pull one out from the
top<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.030> required<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.840> force

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
top and it required a lot of force

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.010 
top and it required a lot of force
that's<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.829> pulled<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.020> that's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's where I pulled it out and that's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.389 
that's where I pulled it out and that's
where<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.490> let<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> fall<00:01:53.640> out<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> bottom

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
where I let it fall out from the bottom

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.039 
where I let it fall out from the bottom
so<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.490> let<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.670> fall<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> bottom<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so I let it fall from the bottom so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.260 
so I let it fall from the bottom so
let's<00:01:58.079> take<00:01:58.409> my<00:01:58.439> hand<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.060> hole

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
let's take my hand down in this hole

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.620 
let's take my hand down in this hole
here<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.579> gently<00:02:02.579> push<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
here and gently push it down and I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.180 
here and gently push it down and I
caught<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.820> now<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.600> pieces<00:02:07.190> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
caught it now these little pieces that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
caught it now these little pieces that
fit<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.349> red<00:02:10.349> velvet<00:02:10.860> area<00:02:11.569> right

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
fit in that red velvet area right

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.350 
fit in that red velvet area right
here<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.220> feel<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> pull<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.880> out<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
here I feel like when I pull it out it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.450 
here I feel like when I pull it out it
might<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:15.900> break<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.620> top<00:02:16.920> piece<00:02:17.130> but

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
might actually break this top piece but

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.390 
might actually break this top piece but
feel<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.940> feels<00:02:18.210> more<00:02:18.600> sturdy<00:02:18.930> than<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
feel this feels more sturdy than the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
feel this feels more sturdy than the
actual<00:02:20.730> cover<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.450> don't<00:02:22.140> know<00:02:22.200> how<00:02:22.290> much

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
actual cover so I don't know how much

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.230 
actual cover so I don't know how much
force<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.920> actually<00:02:23.040> put<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.580> but

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
force you can actually put on it but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.030 
force you can actually put on it but
when<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.390> pull<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.230> kind<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.500> jiggle<00:02:25.920> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
when I pull it out you kind of jiggle it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.400 
when I pull it out you kind of jiggle it
back<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.340> forth<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.880> put<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> push<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.660> forward

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.960 
back on forth and put it push it forward
jiggle<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> put<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.190> screwdriver<00:02:29.460> right

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
jiggle it and put a screwdriver right

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.430 
jiggle it and put a screwdriver right
there<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.920> should<00:02:32.190> wiggle<00:02:32.970> out<00:02:33.410> okay<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
there and it should wiggle out okay I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.580 
there and it should wiggle out okay I
got<00:02:34.710> all<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.720> dashboard<00:02:37.230> out

way you can and there there is an

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.200 
way you can and there there is an
outside<00:04:37.949> look<00:04:38.190> of<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> dashboard

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
outside look of the dashboard

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.290 
outside look of the dashboard
it<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.259> definitely<00:04:40.710> darker<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.090> said

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
it is definitely darker like I said

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.080 
it is definitely darker like I said
before<00:04:43.039> it<00:04:44.039> just<00:04:44.190> looks<00:04:44.430> like<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.789> piece

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
before it just looks like this piece

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.990 
before it just looks like this piece
like<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.560> front<00:04:46.860> plastic<00:04:47.490> piece<00:04:47.699> just

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
like the this front plastic piece just

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.620 
like the this front plastic piece just
continues<00:04:49.220> past<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.520> glass<00:04:50.759> which<00:04:51.090> i<00:04:51.330> think

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
continues past the glass which i think

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.100 
continues past the glass which i think
