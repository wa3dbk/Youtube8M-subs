00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.590
 hi am i in this video i will show you 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.830
 what to do if your washing machine 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.270
 filled with water and the door does not open at 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.849
 most washing machines 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.310
 the door does not open if automatic 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.680
 discovers that there is still water inside and 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.710
 as soon as the water is drained the door 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.540
 will open and pour so as before 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.930
 than trying to force the door open 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.339
 need to drain the water from the car there 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.070
 several ways to do 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.949
 This but the first thing you should try 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.150
 drain the water from the car through the drain hose 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.239
 in the name of all you need to do for this 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:59.570
 it take the drain hose and lower it 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.949
 put the end into a bowl or container 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.739
 below tank level 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.610
 Here we count the water should be free 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.220
 flow into the tank if this happens 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.760
 then we know that there are no clearances 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.130
 hoses 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.010
 and the problem lies in the work of the drain 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.579
 pump we have a video where i show you 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.460
 how to replace the drain pump if water is out 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.219
 the drain hose is not leaking it further here 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.210
 need to try to drain the water from the filter 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:32.359
 if he is on your car we need 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 open the filter cover and then tilt 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:39.079
 car back a little and so we can 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:44.899
 Substitute a bowl or bowl late for her 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:47.780
 and then gradually unscrew the filter 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.609
 concerned with it is quite likely that 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.369
 water begins to trickle 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.460
 and over time the water tank will become 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.139
 full in this case just spinning 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.270
 filter capacitance and back gat 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:04.609
 pour water you can repeat this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.700
 process until all the water from the car is not 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.890
 will result but it is possible that after 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.709
 several attempts to drain the water through 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.790
 drain hose and no water through the filter 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.370
 merges and still remains in the car 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.930
 if so then the pipe is littered between 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.510
 tank and pump 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.599
 i will show you how to get to it and how 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
 drain in this case first we 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.790
 put the car on your back 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.599
 put it on a small towel or 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.599
 piece of cardboard 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.120
 now looking at the bottom of the car 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:47.269
 we can see buying a tank unscrew 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.500
 screw its fastening and tighten the hose 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.950
 top and drain the water for good ideas 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.560
 this will cover the electric 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.569
 car components with towels and us 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:08.689
 you need a small container to collect 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:11.739
 water hose clamp loosened now we 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:21.680
 can neatly wall the hose from the tank and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:24.049
 drain water into the tank of course draining water with 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.190
 using the nozzles of the frames the pump must 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.220
 do gradually 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.319
 water tank is small so 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.079
 it will have to be filled several times and 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.659
 merge as soon as you have completely leaked 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.329
 water and you can completely remove the pipe from 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.780
 tank for the pump to clear it from the gap and 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.479
 put back after that return 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.639
 car in a standing position and then when 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.669
 need you can drain 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.620
 through the drain hose to the law after 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.049
 how do you drain the water from the car 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.419
 the door should open wonderful 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.310
 Remember that spare parts and hoses for all 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:02.109
 Washed cars can be found on the Internet 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.109
 stores thanks for watching
