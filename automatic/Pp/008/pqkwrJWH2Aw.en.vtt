telecommunications people so it's going

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
telecommunications people so it's going
to<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.049> people<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.380> Lucent<00:01:22.970> Alcatel<00:01:23.970> cisco

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
group is Motorola themselves the people

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.399 
group is Motorola themselves the people
who<00:01:33.000> make<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.299> wireless<00:01:33.720> communication

who make the wireless communication
devices<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> last<00:01:36.650> standard<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
devices and then the last standard that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.969 
devices and then the last standard that
we<00:01:37.860> refer<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.670> put<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.750> by<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> FAA<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we refer to is put out by the FAA and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
we refer to is put out by the FAA and
what's<00:01:41.369> interesting<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.479> standards

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
what's interesting these three standards

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.889 
what's interesting these three standards
are<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.430> basically<00:01:44.430> unrelated<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.299> yet<00:01:45.750> when

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
are all basically unrelated and yet when

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
are all basically unrelated and yet when
it<00:01:45.990> comes<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.350> flooring<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.399> agree<00:01:47.820> on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it comes to flooring they all agree on

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.810 
it comes to flooring they all agree on
what<00:01:48.780> type<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.189> electrical<00:01:50.189> properties<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
what type of electrical properties the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090 
what type of electrical properties the
flooring<00:01:51.210> should<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> we've<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:52.920> three

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
flooring should have so we've got three

why<00:02:10.979> we<00:02:11.370> should<00:02:11.879> even<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.360> thinking<00:02:12.510> about<00:02:12.750> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
why we should even be thinking about it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
why we should even be thinking about it
in<00:02:13.680> electricity<00:02:14.100> there's<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.580> number<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.060> laws

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
in electricity there's a number of laws

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720 
in electricity there's a number of laws
now<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.260> Newey's<00:02:16.650> law<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.190> whatever

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
now just like Newey's law and whatever

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.120 
now just like Newey's law and whatever
other<00:02:18.030> law<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.330> want<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.720> refer<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
other law you want to refer to and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.860 
other law you want to refer to and
electricity<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.850> one<00:02:21.120> called<00:02:21.300> Ohm's<00:02:21.630> law

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
electricity we have one called Ohm's law

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.100 
electricity we have one called Ohm's law
and<00:02:22.530> Ohm's<00:02:22.950> law<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.520> basically<00:02:23.970> an<00:02:24.300> equation

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and Ohm's law is basically an equation

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.520 
and Ohm's law is basically an equation
that<00:02:25.710> uses<00:02:26.070> three<00:02:26.310> variables<00:02:27.530> voltage

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
that uses three variables voltage

good<00:02:43.890> analogy<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.030> about<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
good analogy for you to think about is

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.420 
good analogy for you to think about is
if<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:46.230> were<00:02:46.350> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:46.890> pulling<00:02:47.250> the

if we were going to be pulling the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
if we were going to be pulling the
charge<00:02:47.700> away<00:02:47.850> very<00:02:48.120> rapidly<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.290> would<00:02:49.410> be

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
charge away very rapidly that would be

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.590 
charge away very rapidly that would be
the<00:02:49.620> equivalent<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.160> standing<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.120> couple

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
everyone knows you don't do that but the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.650 
everyone knows you don't do that but the

other end we don't want the floor to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.900 
other end we don't want the floor to
drain<00:03:00.930> static<00:03:01.410> electricity<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.220> slowly<00:03:02.610> that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
drain static electricity so slowly that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.030 
drain static electricity so slowly that
it<00:03:03.450> behaves<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.530> carpet<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.010> your

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
living room because obviously we all

charges<00:03:08.850> us<00:03:09.000> up<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.020> look<00:03:10.170> at<00:03:10.290> floors<00:03:10.590> what

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
charges us up so we look at floors what

for<00:04:30.220> these<00:04:30.370> spaces<00:04:30.639> because<00:04:31.419> we've

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
for these spaces because we've

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.719

and<00:04:43.870> that's<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:45.129> you<00:04:45.250> eliminate<00:04:45.909> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
and that's because when you eliminate a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.570 
and that's because when you eliminate a
shock<00:04:46.629> hazard<00:04:46.840> using<00:04:47.409> the<00:04:47.470> floor<00:04:47.740> all<00:04:48.280> you're

shock hazard using the floor all you're

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.580 
shock hazard using the floor all you're
doing<00:04:48.879> is<00:04:49.000> preventing<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.629> floor<00:04:49.930> from

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
doing is preventing the floor from

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.540 
doing is preventing the floor from
generating<00:04:51.129> charges<00:04:51.729> over<00:04:52.270> 3,500<00:04:53.139> volts
