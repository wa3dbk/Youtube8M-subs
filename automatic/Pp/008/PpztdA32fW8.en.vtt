this is a Hot Tools one inch so what I
like<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.920> do<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.369> will<00:01:15.429> just<00:01:15.640> curl<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.569> left

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
like to do is I will just curl the left

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.899 
like to do is I will just curl the left
side<00:01:17.079> I<00:01:17.380> used<00:01:17.799> my<00:01:17.950> left<00:01:18.189> hand<00:01:18.340> or<00:01:18.609> my<00:01:18.729> right

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
side I used my left hand or my right

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.039 
side I used my left hand or my right
hand<00:01:19.210> for<00:01:19.479> everything<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.649> this<00:01:20.969> tutorial

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hand for everything in this tutorial

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.270 
hand for everything in this tutorial
because<00:01:23.049> in<00:01:23.200> my<00:01:23.259> last<00:01:23.439> tutorial<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:24.009> switched

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
because in my last tutorial I switched

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.859 
because in my last tutorial I switched
hands<00:01:24.579> for<00:01:24.880> each<00:01:24.969> side<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.479> did<00:01:25.659> it<00:01:25.780> was

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
hands for each side that I did it was

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.989 
hands for each side that I did it was
always<00:01:25.990> opposite<00:01:26.530> pull<00:01:27.219> it<00:01:27.369> down<00:01:27.579> like<00:01:27.819> that

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
always opposite pull it down like that

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.270 
always opposite pull it down like that
so<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.509> actually<00:01:28.630> looks<00:01:29.049> pretty<00:01:29.289> curly<00:01:29.950> even

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
so it actually looks pretty curly even

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.649 
so it actually looks pretty curly even
though<00:01:30.399> once<00:01:30.850> we're<00:01:31.030> done<00:01:31.149> it<00:01:31.359> won't<00:01:31.509> look

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
though once we're done it won't look

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.770 
though once we're done it won't look
like<00:01:31.719> that<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.600> yeah<00:01:34.719> I<00:01:34.749> just<00:01:35.069> curl<00:01:36.069> your<00:01:36.249> hair

the next layer and then I'll turn the
camera<00:03:45.410> back<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:45.680> for<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.980> top<00:03:46.160> layer<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:46.580> i

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
camera back on for the top layer so i

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.830

then when I let it down is when I kind

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.460 
then when I let it down is when I kind
of<00:04:29.789> pull<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> straight<00:04:30.479> down<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.350> get

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that like spiral I don't know if I

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.290 
that like spiral I don't know if I
explained<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.630> earlier<00:04:35.030> i'll<00:04:36.030> show<00:04:36.240> you

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
explained that earlier i'll show you
