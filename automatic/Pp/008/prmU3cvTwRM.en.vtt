the standard stuff problem-sets classes
lectures<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.450> I've<00:01:33.570> also<00:01:33.689> had<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.350> master's

lectures but I've also had this master's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.929 
lectures but I've also had this master's
project<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> background<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
project in the background which is now

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.700 
project in the background which is now
starting<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.270> round<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.810> intensity<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.530> my

Master's project is in atmospheric
physics<00:01:39.210> department<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.350> particular<00:01:40.439> I'm

looking at stochastic models of the
atmosphere<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> thing<00:01:44.759> called<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
atmosphere so there's a thing called a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749

am doing is saying ok let's look at a
particular<00:01:57.869> point<00:01:58.700> let's<00:01:59.700> pretend<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
particular point let's pretend that we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.319 
particular point let's pretend that we
could<00:02:00.960> model<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:02.189> incredibly<00:02:03.060> complicated

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
could model this incredibly complicated

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.020 
could model this incredibly complicated

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.820 
that equation in order to make it work
and<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.810> some<00:02:22.959> very<00:02:22.990> nifty<00:02:23.290> analysis

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and you do some very nifty analysis

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.290 
and you do some very nifty analysis
involving<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> autocorrelation<00:02:24.640> function

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
involving the autocorrelation function

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.910 
involving the autocorrelation function
of<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> dataset<00:02:25.840> which<00:02:26.290> allows<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.830> to

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
of the dataset which allows you to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.640 
of the dataset which allows you to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
represent it you can represent the data

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.860 
represent it you can represent the data
set<00:02:31.959> with<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.320> simple<00:02:32.590> model<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:34.570> so

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
set with this simple model and if so

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.110 
set with this simple model and if so
what<00:02:35.410> parameters<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.920> want<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.940> works

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
what parameters you want and that works

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.660 
what parameters you want and that works
pretty<00:02:37.300> well<00:02:37.420> for<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:37.840> point<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.950> what<00:02:39.489> we

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
pretty well for one point but what we

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.550 
pretty well for one point but what we
want<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.209> do<00:02:40.989> more<00:02:41.200> than<00:02:41.320> one<00:02:41.440> point

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
want to do is do more than one point

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.380 
want to do is do more than one point

this<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.890> system<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.380> see<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:50.980> points<00:02:51.459> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
this the system and see what points that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.390 
this the system and see what points that
just<00:02:52.480> breaks<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.530> further<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
just breaks down and further that's the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.160 
just breaks down and further that's the
whole<00:02:54.489> notion<00:02:54.670> whether<00:02:55.209> it's<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.870> Oh
