00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.550
 which way did the last 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.789
 training on the eve of the new 

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:05.760
 season the team played five 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.370
 Friendly matches of which 4 achieved 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.199
 victories 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:10.769
 last control meeting with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.409
 wings of the capital 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.339
 won with a score of 4 3 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.669
 in the new season the honor of the club will protect 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.960
 famous artists Vasily Purish 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.949
 he played in the clubs of the killed e more 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 five hundred matches 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.580
 I threw about 100 pucks of the opponent's gate 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.939
 and this season to increase 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880
 electric crystal in this is mine 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.550
 task of course so guys 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.719
 why is it easy not just to get up on 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.930
 queue maybe guys who will see this 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.850
 if you have to sell the interrogation there, I always 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.830
 ready 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.470
 select prompt view 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.950
 I think that there will be no problems 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 because in principle, hockey already comes out 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.070
 despite the job growth whatever 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.490
 all are equal to the head coach 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.810
 Vladimir Marinic symbolic figure 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.390
 electric hockey 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.200
 under his leadership in the coming year 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.020
 prepare as young players 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.480
 Electrostal's pupils 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.610
 sports school 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.250
 so sharpen your skills and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.130
 professionals Valery College and 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.380
 my first coach he invited me 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.520
 this year's girl is also also bigger 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.700
 such errors 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.770
 UN principle 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 teach young guys just the topic of the deputy 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.740
 they say what, therefore, in principle, what 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.200
 plots ready gives 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.940
 with intense enough large 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.470
 palaces ride poland 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.200
 but the team and the hall but the guys enter themselves 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.550
 there yes it was there 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.680
 training, in principle, I think that in hard 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740
 I very well led the team at the beginning 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.210
 August guys were active 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.470
 training on the ground 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740
 The main focus was tactical and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.330
 technical training 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.550
 tasks for the upcoming season are optimal 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.810
 enter the number of winners and this goal 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.970
 quite achievable 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.400
 as usual we fight for the top places 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.480
 there is 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.850
 years ago she had this situation 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.430
 during the first lady 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.490
 really fought 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250
 instead of this year thursday 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550
 September the thirtieth of the first of October Crystal 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.670
 will hold the first game this season with this 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 club Vladimir 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.950
 the beginning of the meeting at 18 30 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.170
