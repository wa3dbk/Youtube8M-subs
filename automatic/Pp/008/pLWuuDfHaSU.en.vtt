yet at July possum can see come to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.040 
yet at July possum can see come to
Munson<00:01:54.410> tofu<00:01:54.710> Newton<00:01:55.160> Macan<00:01:55.580> s<00:01:55.820> July<00:01:56.450> shuttle

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
Munson tofu Newton Macan s July shuttle

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.370 
Munson tofu Newton Macan s July shuttle
go<00:01:57.170> something<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:57.740> poop<00:01:58.570> about<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.960> size<00:02:00.170> of

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
go something like poop about the size of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.090 
go something like poop about the size of
a<00:02:00.500> quarter

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
a quarter

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.640 
a quarter
so<00:02:01.550> they<00:02:01.910> just<00:02:02.120> put<00:02:02.300> one<00:02:02.570> little<00:02:02.840> arm<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.350> and

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
so they just put one little arm in and

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.730 
so they just put one little arm in and
squeeze<00:02:04.490> right<00:02:05.000> through<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.050> she<00:02:06.440> does<00:02:06.590> have

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
squeeze right through and she does have

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.919 
squeeze right through and she does have
hold<00:02:06.980> of<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.220> shrimp<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.330> let's<00:02:08.540> see<00:02:08.690> if<00:02:08.780> she's

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
hold of the shrimp so let's see if she's

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.410 
hold of the shrimp so let's see if she's
gonna<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.140> lazy<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.980> not<00:02:10.540> open<00:02:11.540> up<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.840> jar

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
gonna be lazy and not open up the jar

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.390 
gonna be lazy and not open up the jar
but<00:02:14.420> maybe<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.750> shows<00:02:15.230> how<00:02:15.440> smart<00:02:15.740> she<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.070> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
but maybe that shows how smart she is is

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.010 
but maybe that shows how smart she is is
that<00:02:16.610> if<00:02:16.970> she<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.300> figure<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.690> way<00:02:17.750> where

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that if she can figure out a way where

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.180 
that if she can figure out a way where
she<00:02:18.050> doesn't<00:02:18.350> have<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> do<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.680> much<00:02:18.950> we're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
she doesn't have to do that much we're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.950 
she doesn't have to do that much we're
act<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:20.390> sound<00:02:20.630> like

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
act like it sound like

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.140 
act like it sound like
yeah<00:02:22.410> well<00:02:23.010> they're<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.610> very<00:02:23.850> intelligent

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
yeah well they're very very intelligent

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150 
yeah well they're very very intelligent
a<00:02:24.480> lot<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.750> people<00:02:24.990> compare<00:02:25.380> them<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> cats<00:02:25.980> or

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
a lot of people compare them to cats or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.660 
a lot of people compare them to cats or

these<00:02:26.970> octopus<00:02:27.570> actually<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.770> ability

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
these octopus actually have the ability

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.850 
these octopus actually have the ability
to<00:02:29.490> learn<00:02:29.730> by<00:02:30.180> observation<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:31.350> that's

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
to learn by observation and that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.890 
to learn by observation and that's
something<00:02:32.310> no<00:02:32.520> other<00:02:32.670> invertebrates<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.660> do

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
something no other invertebrates can do

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500 
something no other invertebrates can do

we<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.340> hamster<00:02:38.910> balls<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.800> what

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
we have hamster balls and you know what

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.950 
we have hamster balls and you know what
kind<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.340> play<00:02:41.610> school<00:02:41.940> type<00:02:42.210> children's<00:02:42.720> toys

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
kind of play school type children's toys

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840 
kind of play school type children's toys
but<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.350> she<00:02:43.470> has<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.710> pull<00:02:43.950> apart<00:02:44.100> the

octopus<00:02:45.750> moves<00:02:45.990> around<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.530> its<00:02:46.680> arms<00:02:47.070> as

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
octopus moves around with its arms as

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.670 
octopus moves around with its arms as
well<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.820> its<00:02:48.000> siphon<00:02:48.570> which<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.170> also<00:02:49.380> used

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
well as its siphon which is also used

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
well as its siphon which is also used
for<00:02:49.920> respiration<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.510> she<00:02:51.660> takes<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.990> lot<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
for respiration so if she takes a lot of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.640 
for respiration so if she takes a lot of
water<00:02:52.640> into<00:02:53.640> her<00:02:54.120> mantle<00:02:54.960> through<00:02:55.230> her<00:02:55.410> gill

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
water into her mantle through her gill

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.220 
water into her mantle through her gill
slits<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.490> then<00:02:56.940> she<00:02:57.150> pushes<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.720> out<00:02:57.960> through

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
slits and then she pushes it out through

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.560 
slits and then she pushes it out through
her<00:02:58.350> siphon<00:02:58.830> really<00:02:59.070> fast<00:02:59.400> she<00:03:00.000> can<00:03:00.030> jet

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
her siphon really fast she can jet

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.750 
her siphon really fast she can jet
