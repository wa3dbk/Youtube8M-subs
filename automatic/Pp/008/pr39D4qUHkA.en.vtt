00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
it was like to go scout some place it
was<00:02:07.860> only<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.340> few<00:02:08.670> points<00:02:09.179> whereas<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> was

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
was only a few points whereas if it was

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.550 
was only a few points whereas if it was
to<00:02:10.709> kill<00:02:11.009> enemies<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.760> 25<00:02:12.120> points<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.410> it's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
to kill enemies it was 25 points so it's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.200 
to kill enemies it was 25 points so it's
25

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
25

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.290 
25
10<00:02:14.450> or<00:02:14.780> 5<00:02:15.740> plus<00:02:16.100> 10<00:02:16.310> which<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.490> 15<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.440> when<00:02:18.440> I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
10 or 5 plus 10 which is 15 so when I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200 
10 or 5 plus 10 which is 15 so when I
went<00:02:20.300> completed<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.860> took<00:02:22.100> me<00:02:22.250> 12<00:02:22.550> hours<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.060> do

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.280 
went completed it took me 12 hours to do
that<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.230> I've<00:02:24.320> decided<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:25.070> just<00:02:25.390> add<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.930> more
