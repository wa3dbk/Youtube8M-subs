00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.909
 this business of a woman 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.239
 important 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:15.929
 highlight the eyes 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.599
 who you came to the eye is what draws most attention to Japanese drawing 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.499
 glow insulation 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.799
 format of the face format annular or in fair format 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.979
 It's important, you'll be this. 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:35.329
 and spiky hair is what draws much attention from neighbors everything 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.710
 that this realistic example of August we start talking about the doctor that the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 life cycle and environment 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.370
 marking the heights of the eyes of the nose and mouth are the elements of the face 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.570
 finished this easy you will pass that the computer will not 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 the outline of being the face 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.980
 What are you going to finish later? 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.980
 with hair finish 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 everything you want to draw 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.450
 part of a geometric shape 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.510
 the son tanzi the child 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.320
 for example the drought 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 I start from a cylinder 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.730
 né of cylinder as you will be the embryo of that will make a living 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.580
 the strike begins to turn into the caatinga that you tahrir looking like 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.630
 example 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.360
 after defining dash lights and shadows you can even work through 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 smoke and season and negative nonsense 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.280
 said 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.880
 it was a comic character event 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 each character has its anatomy 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.350
 at home and with the chubby character I remember good-natured in that character 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.650
 nice 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.820
 It is important for you to work the rounded shapes or urban monument leads to the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.780
 head a good margin of points 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.499
 even with your hands too 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:00.200
 are one line only month 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.179
 yes what leaves the character already made important to emphasize this without neck 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790
 and the expression gay expression 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.149
 yet another example of the iconic character 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:23.149
 this one is now skinnier 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.069
 the longer character does not say so 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.569
 what could no longer meet my plans are more open 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.620
 even so 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040
 I already work with circular shape disaster that the head you start with 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.899
 a balloon 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:40.269
 the most important thing besides the anatomy of the character you value the 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.949
 video expression of a citizen camera 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.099
 nani has to identify with that movement that he is doing 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 is the case still teresa parodi what are you doing 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.329
 for example now with the human body 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.429
 It's important that you dial 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.739
 in drawing when working on the body 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.180
 joints the body of the councilman was elected twice 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:20.100
 feelings 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 working with the geometric shapes prince 101 euros 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.149
 defined the scheme 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.979
 I work like starting with his head. 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:35.029
 I'm out however as the local work the composition right 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.439
 passing through the body now 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.180
 it also became either man or woman never went out of fashion female 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.219
 born renato 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.219
 observe the proportions of arm and leg 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.749
 I'm afraid I'm careful with the exaggerations 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.559
 the example for this scenario 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.919
 what they say is not only the face the body also 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.699
 There you have to know how to work. 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.499
 perspective - I found that they had to work wherever during the break and 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:28.169
 depth in your slack you get the idea of ​​volume edit depth 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.469
 because it is bathed to have contact with someone and you are living the milan 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.759
 this Tuesday's minute of play when you try to overcome this is your 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:37.370
 performance 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.189
 geometric shapes are always imposing 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:45.219
 It's important that you picture this the way you see it 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.729
 idea of ​​depth in what you face the crisis 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.530
 same 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.240
 good example of finishes 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.310
 a spider man 20 coolest comic characters at least in the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.180
 my opinion 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.520
 basically you have to work the light tones starting again of course that the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.080
 clubs the light shades first and then you start to give volume 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.930
 with the most excluded points both the first and can be observed in synop 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.199
 to smile 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.960
 It's also about pm 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.550
 every year or the final finish and with a stronger blue tone 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.339
 still in September 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.339
 the spider man is portrayed 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.969
 for example a cartoon 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.740
 in the cartoon you have to do what you have to extract and what it is 

00:05:44.739 --> 00:05:49.229
 funniest of the person is a simplification of the tragic then you 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.159
 catch the kilo the look the shape of the nose the Swiss format of the mouth beard and hair 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.099
 length in the case of the model there 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.860
 you have to get another solid person and turn that into a 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.339
 the dash of a doll is admitted a funny thing now 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.860
 every caricaturist has his style - exaggeration more 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.710
 others still generate less the important thing is that you take the insistence of the person 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.369
 which translates the personality of the person in that December
