00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.880
 We continue to watch fashion on minekravt and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.040
 This already 101 series of our with you reviews 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 but the current mod is just 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.260
 Awesome after all he adds in maykravt 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 all sorts of different animals from the wild 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.970
 well, and right now we are with you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.490
 consider each animal more 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 in detail, well, the very first mod with us 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.960
 called 7 boils which translates as 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 centipede let's and and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 sleep and as you can see it really 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 Here is such a small and harmless 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.190
 centipede i.e. it doesn't bite 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.920
 doesn't hurt anyone in general just runs and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
 does nothing 2 could it have us here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 such a cricket 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
 and I'll tell you what he looks like 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 cool and even sounds so cool 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.129
 he rents in general he, too, completely 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.949
 harmless 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 no harm to you next 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
 could we have this beautiful here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 a butterfly that can speak so 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.520
 the existence of a nice decorate gaming 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 the world of minecraft is just sad that this 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.110
 mod adds only one butterfly light 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 I think it would be cool if these 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.520
 butterflies would be well, at least three species 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.680
 in general, let's hope that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 the developers of this mod will add more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.409
 kinds of these beautiful creatures and we 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.840
 you go further well and then we go 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.180
 mod called liza that translates 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 like a lizard, by the way, too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
 harmless and accordingly nothing 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.100
 does but still it looks very 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.530
 even cool next fifth could it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.930
 we are such a common fish 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 all these fish are completely different 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.030
 kind of well and also how would it obviously not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.100
 sounded if you kill one of these fish 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.280
 then it will surely fall out of it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.310
 right raw fish okay go ahead 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 the next 6 could out of this mod this here 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.570
 such a snake that I will tell you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.479
 beware if she bites 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.850
 she will inflict you about 3 hearts 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.829
 health but also in addition to that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 poison you and on pretty 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.100
 long time 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 I am generally better for these snakes not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.530
 fit 7 could called anglers this 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
 something like this is such a toothy fish 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.750
 with a luminous ball on the end of this 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.330
 mustache and also this fish is also very 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.940
 dangerous truth only in water on land i 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.120
 I think it is much harm you will not cause 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.980
 the next 8 could be called manta ray 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.950
 this is something like electric stingray 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.540
 which also lives in water and in theory 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.330
 electric ramp should be 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 hostile mobs but in this fashion he is very 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.910
 even friendly and so he never 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.160
 You will not offend 9 next experience with us 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.290
 the most ordinary mouse which is just 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.780
 runs and squeaks don't know which one 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.870
 sense but nonetheless squeaks this mouse 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.980
 very funny okay go ahead and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.440
 next with us 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.599
 wow what a giant could we perhaps 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.299
 send it down somewhere here and you 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.310
 just look at it this is real 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.250
 hefty whale inside it can even 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.380
 live here look hello to you all 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.930
 shrimp we are reporting live 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.390
 from the head of a whale damn okay in general you 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.519
 understand that you can even live inside the whale 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.950
 well, the very last eleventh could 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.780
 this is such a bird that is forever 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.600
 somewhere in a hurry you just look 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.790
 how fast she runs well, apparently she has 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.400
 there are some urgent matters there and she 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.950
 rushing as quickly as possible to complete them 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.200
 but also such as birds tarot them 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.630
 say there are several different colors 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.940
 Well, in general, this mod we are with you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.220
 fully considered on this to us 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.079
 probably it's time to say goodbye 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.450
 write in the comments of the mob 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.220
 which you liked the most to me 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.980
 personally for example like this one 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.650
 hefty whale don't know why probably 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.350
 because he is so huge in general 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.989
