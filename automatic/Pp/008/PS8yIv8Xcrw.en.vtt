important for we must know and we must
learn<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.079> companies<00:02:06.590> are<00:02:06.890> not<00:02:07.070> only<00:02:07.850> in<00:02:08.119> one

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
learn the companies are not only in one

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.200 
learn the companies are not only in one
country<00:02:08.600> they<00:02:09.229> are<00:02:09.350> global<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.369> therefore<00:02:10.789> we

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
country they are global so therefore we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.340 
country they are global so therefore we
want<00:02:11.420> cooperate<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:14.270> successful<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
want cooperate to be successful for the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.100 
want cooperate to be successful for the
workers<00:02:16.060> increasingly<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.390> agenda<00:02:17.960> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
workers increasingly the agenda the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.260 
workers increasingly the agenda the
economic<00:02:18.650> agenda<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.220> political<00:02:19.730> agenda<00:02:20.180> is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
economic agenda the political agenda is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.330 
economic agenda the political agenda is
being<00:02:20.450> set<00:02:20.690> by<00:02:20.870> multinational<00:02:21.680> corporations

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
being set by multinational corporations

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.059 
being set by multinational corporations
and<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:24.110> clear<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:24.890> have

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
and so I think it's clear that we have

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.380 
and so I think it's clear that we have
to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 
to
act<00:02:25.510> globally<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.520> take<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.940> these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
act globally and to take on these

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.570 
act globally and to take on these
corporations<00:02:28.709> there's<00:02:29.709> an<00:02:29.890> attack<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.370> unions

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
corporations there's an attack on unions

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.030 
corporations there's an attack on unions
all<00:02:30.970> over<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.300> world<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.680> it's

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
all over the world and so it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.370 
all over the world and so it's
incredibly<00:02:34.030> important<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.840> think<00:02:35.230> we

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
incredibly important that I think we

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.949 
incredibly important that I think we
build<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:36.130> trade<00:02:36.400> union<00:02:36.760> movement<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.540> over

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
build the trade union movement all over

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.270 
build the trade union movement all over
the<00:02:38.080> world<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:39.250> act<00:02:39.490> together<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> yes

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the world and we act together and so yes

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.070 
the world and we act together and so yes
international<00:02:42.970> solidarity<00:02:43.150> i<00:02:43.660> think<00:02:43.959> is

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
international solidarity i think is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.590 
international solidarity i think is
incredibly<00:02:44.860> important<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.209> i<00:02:46.300> saw<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
incredibly important and i saw the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.890

the<00:03:23.769> camp<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.220> I'd<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> German

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
the camp and I'd I have a German

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.890 
the camp and I'd I have a German
collection<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.650> stamps<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.420> wasn't<00:03:28.600> sure

collection of stamps and I wasn't sure

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.539

if<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.140> wanted<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.410> keep<00:03:29.560> him<00:03:29.799> get<00:03:30.190> rid<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.400> him

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
if I wanted to keep him get rid of him

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.229 
if I wanted to keep him get rid of him
destroy<00:03:31.120> him<00:03:32.670> talking<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.760> over<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.180> I

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
destroy him talking it over and I

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.090 
destroy him talking it over and I
decided<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:35.019> more<00:03:35.380> positive<00:03:35.560> thing<00:03:35.980> to

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
decided that a more positive thing to

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.539 
decided that a more positive thing to
move<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:37.000> do<00:03:37.180> would<00:03:37.600> be<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.860> use<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.010> stamps<00:03:39.400> as

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
move to do would be to use the stamps as

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.690 
move to do would be to use the stamps as
an<00:03:39.970> educational<00:03:40.959> tool<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.190> people<00:03:42.579> can

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
an educational tool so that people can

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.449 
an educational tool so that people can
are<00:03:43.030> aware<00:03:43.390> of<00:03:43.450> what<00:03:43.750> happened<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:45.190> not<00:03:45.340> only
