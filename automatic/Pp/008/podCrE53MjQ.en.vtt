00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 I am very happy with how it is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.049
 gone because I was fast 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.519
 at the beginning I am very happy with the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.480
 motorcycle we made two three changes 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 I managed to improve and above all 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.150
 the pace is very similar to that of york e 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.150
 like him we got the usa rules 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.410
 must read with the same bases and 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.779
 however I will send if to improve 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.790
 like him so I'm very happy 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.610
 there is because we are certain before the end 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.760
 also deleted in a bit program has 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.890
 then walked around as something rhythm 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.590
 less and so you could not start 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.370
 better a feeling even better than 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.650
 that of the ex 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.870
 maybe yes I think there's jerez we have 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.970
 stepped forward because we have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.830
 changed the setting I put a 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.600
 setting that I like more in fact that 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.729
 here they arrived on the market I was 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.820
 in front of this one in turn and then 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.510
 above all they are there at 50 so there is the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.670
 we can play 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.739
 and let's say this is can be fast 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.930
 right from the first round is a little 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.470
 news in the last 3 4 years I did more 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 effort luigi buonanno instead yes 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.290
 naturally we will have to see the races 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.970
 after race c but for now there 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 we enjoy this first number one because 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.620
 we are there and in any case fails at the end 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.140
 to beat me extra strong Christmas 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.360
 so there is a neighbor and therefore we are 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.240
 in front of the honda it is very important 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 I think the situation will change, I think 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.840
 that the honda will be fast 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.370
 will improve 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.170
 mazzarri says so we already do 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.900
 started working on the details for 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.310
 legs like mapping how to decide 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.010
 the balance of the bike then 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.310
 in short, we can work film if the 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.220
 hello you see it from the evening from robben 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.620
 big visas or now we wait tomorrow 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.330
 and see where to be able to 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.580
 improve a bit however nice because 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.320
 the interview I try to do others 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.220
 trajectories where this event seems to me 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.530
 I edit my best time just undergone 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.660
 the motion I respond well to studies 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.660
 baby thanks compliments and scum 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.990
 field really very well true the 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.990
 sensation
