00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
hey guys so today's video is about how I

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.620 
hey guys so today's video is about how I
improve<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> accuracy<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.000> droids<00:00:09.240> really

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
improve the accuracy of my droids really

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.720 
improve the accuracy of my droids really
quickly<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> wrote<00:00:11.070> from<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.429> really

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
quickly so how I wrote from this really

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
quickly so how I wrote from this really
poor<00:00:12.210> looking<00:00:12.660> drum<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.080> did<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> myself<00:00:13.769> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
poor looking drum that I did of myself a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.829 
poor looking drum that I did of myself a
few<00:00:14.040> years<00:00:14.340> ago<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.179> much<00:00:15.389> more<00:00:15.599> accurate

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
few years ago so it's much more accurate

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
few years ago so it's much more accurate
and<00:00:16.199> realistic<00:00:16.619> drawing<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.279> did<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.490> Eddie

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and realistic drawing I did of Eddie

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
and realistic drawing I did of Eddie
Redmayne<00:00:18.210> recently<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.109> today<00:00:19.439> I'm<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
things that I thought really improved my

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
things that I thought really improved my
accuracy<00:00:23.910> also<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:24.930> quickly<00:00:25.320> wanted<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
accuracy also I just quickly wanted to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
accuracy also I just quickly wanted to
mention<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> changes<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> my

the<00:00:55.440> most<00:00:55.590> important<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the most important thing when you do a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
the most important thing when you do a
drawing<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> get<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.199> accurate

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
drawing is to get a really accurate

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
drawing is to get a really accurate
sketch<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.640> matter<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.120> much<00:01:00.300> shading<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> do

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
sketch no matter how much shading you do

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
sketch no matter how much shading you do
if<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.829> sketch<00:01:02.070> isn't<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:03.480> accurate<00:01:03.600> at

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
if the sketch isn't really accurate at

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
if the sketch isn't really accurate at
the<00:01:04.049> start<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.619> shading<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the start no shading is going to make of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.250 
the start no shading is going to make of
your<00:01:06.210> drawing<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.570> whatever<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.049> drawing

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
your drawing or whatever your drawing

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
your drawing or whatever your drawing
look<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:08.010> realistic<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
look more realistic because the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
look more realistic because the
foundations<00:01:10.680> were<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> first

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
foundations were not there in the first

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
foundations were not there in the first
place<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.229> important<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
place so it's really important to get a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
place so it's really important to get a
really<00:01:14.520> accurate<00:01:14.549> starting<00:01:15.540> sketch<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really accurate starting sketch so the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
really accurate starting sketch so the
first<00:01:16.830> thing<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> did<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.460> really<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:18.180> an

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
first thing I did to really get an

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
first thing I did to really get an
accurate<00:01:18.840> sketch<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.530> started<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> trace<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
accurate sketch was I started to trace a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
accurate sketch was I started to trace a
few<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.820> pieces<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.540> there's<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
few of my pieces and there's a lot of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
few of my pieces and there's a lot of
controversy<00:01:22.920> people<00:01:23.640> saying<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.240> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
controversy people saying that if you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.450 
controversy people saying that if you
trace<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.930> cheating<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.130> you're<00:01:26.280> just

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
trace your cheating but if you're just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
trace your cheating but if you're just
using<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> learning<00:01:27.600> tool<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.710> don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
using it as a learning tool then I don't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
using it as a learning tool then I don't
really<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> shame<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> traced<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
really see the shame in it so I traced a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
really see the shame in it so I traced a
few<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.070> earlier<00:01:32.490> pieces<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:34.140> was

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
few of my earlier pieces and it was

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
few of my earlier pieces and it was
because<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.979> wanted<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> train<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:35.880> brain<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
because I wanted to train my brain to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
because I wanted to train my brain to
perceive<00:01:36.720> things<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.409> were

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
perceive things as they really were

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.130 
perceive things as they really were
because<00:01:38.670> most<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> time<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:40.020> doing

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because most of the time if you're doing

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.870 
because most of the time if you're doing
an<00:01:40.320> accurate<00:01:40.740> drawing<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> because

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
an accurate drawing it's just because

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
an accurate drawing it's just because
your<00:01:42.000> brain<00:01:42.180> isn't<00:01:42.390> perceiving<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> objects

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
your brain isn't perceiving the objects

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
your brain isn't perceiving the objects
as<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.060> transfer<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
as they are so you don't transfer it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.039 
as they are so you don't transfer it
onto<00:01:46.140> paper<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.920> well<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:48.000> tracing<00:01:48.630> really

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
onto paper that well so tracing really

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.560 
onto paper that well so tracing really
is<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> good<00:01:49.560> tool<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.549> trace<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.329> 10

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is a good tool if you trace them for 10

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
is a good tool if you trace them for 10
times<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.380> freehand<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.610> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
times and then freehand it then your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.670 
times and then freehand it then your
skills<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.840> much<00:01:55.049> better<00:01:55.259> because

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
skills will be that much better because

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
skills will be that much better because
you've<00:01:55.979> traced<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.490> 10<00:01:56.700> times<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.570> brain

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you've traced it 10 times and your brain

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.350 
you've traced it 10 times and your brain
has<00:01:58.020> drawn<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.560> 10<00:01:58.890> times<00:01:59.070> accurately<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.180> when

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
has drawn it 10 times accurately so when

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
has drawn it 10 times accurately so when
you<00:02:00.450> freehand<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> lot

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you freehand it it's going to be a lot

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
you freehand it it's going to be a lot
better<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.969> you're<00:02:03.360> learning<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
better because you're learning the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.610 
better because you're learning the
mistakes<00:02:04.380> whereas<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> drip<00:02:05.460> freehand

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
mistakes whereas if you drip freehand

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.980 
mistakes whereas if you drip freehand
ten<00:02:06.740> times<00:02:06.890> over<00:02:07.160> you're<00:02:07.490> not<00:02:07.670> learning<00:02:08.000> how

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
ten times over you're not learning how

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.410 
ten times over you're not learning how
it's<00:02:09.229> meant<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.619> actually<00:02:09.830> be<00:02:10.340> drawn<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.060> your

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's meant to actually be drawn so your

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.360 
it's meant to actually be drawn so your
your<00:02:12.020> brain<00:02:12.260> isn't<00:02:12.590> learning<00:02:12.680> how<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> should

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
your brain isn't learning how it should

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.760 
your brain isn't learning how it should
be<00:02:13.520> drawn<00:02:13.840> when<00:02:14.840> you're<00:02:14.960> tracing<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.620> image

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
be drawn when you're tracing the image

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.370 
be drawn when you're tracing the image
make<00:02:16.370> sure<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.820> flip<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.540> image<00:02:17.690> before<00:02:18.050> you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
make sure you flip the image before you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.050 
make sure you flip the image before you
trace<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.190> when<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.430> trace<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.700> onto

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
trace it so that when you trace it onto

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.940 
trace it so that when you trace it onto
the<00:02:20.150> paper<00:02:20.360> it'll<00:02:21.080> come<00:02:21.350> out<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.800> right

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the paper it'll come out as the right

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.560 
the paper it'll come out as the right
way<00:02:22.130> round<00:02:22.370> otherwise<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.180> will<00:02:23.330> be<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
way round otherwise it will be the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.590 
way round otherwise it will be the
flipped<00:02:23.900> image<00:02:24.820> okay<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.180> first<00:02:26.390> thing

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
flipped image okay so the first thing

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
flipped image okay so the first thing
that<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.810> do<00:02:26.930> when<00:02:27.170> my<00:02:27.320> reference<00:02:27.770> photo<00:02:27.890> is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that I do when my reference photo is

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.360 
that I do when my reference photo is
that<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:28.910> import<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.600> into<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.080> photo<00:02:30.440> editor<00:02:31.130> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that I import it into a photo editor and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.210 
that I import it into a photo editor and
I<00:02:31.670> use<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.180> pick<00:02:32.480> E<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.900> that's<00:02:33.020> free<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.740> I

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
I use I pick E and that's free and I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.490 
I use I pick E and that's free and I
just<00:02:34.460> put<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> sketch<00:02:35.060> effect<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.050> it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
just put a sketch effect on it and it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.680 
just put a sketch effect on it and it
just<00:02:36.710> gives<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> basic<00:02:37.760> lines<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
just gives you the basic lines of the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.710 
just gives you the basic lines of the
photo<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.590> basic<00:02:39.980> outline<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.640> everything<00:02:40.910> so

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
photo the basic outline of everything so

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.360 
photo the basic outline of everything so
it's<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.110> easy<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:43.010> your<00:02:43.160> first

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it's really easy to do your first

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270 
it's really easy to do your first
drawing<00:02:43.700> from<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.900> if<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.410> was<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
drawing from so if I was just to use the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.360 
drawing from so if I was just to use the
reference<00:02:46.670> photo<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.600> her<00:02:48.170> face<00:02:48.440> it's<00:02:48.860> hard<00:02:49.160> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
reference photo in her face it's hard to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.980 
reference photo in her face it's hard to
find<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.790> stink<00:02:50.060> lines<00:02:50.240> especially<00:02:50.900> around

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
find the stink lines especially around

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.320 
find the stink lines especially around
the<00:02:51.290> eyes<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.890> nose<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.700> for<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> nose

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
the eyes and the nose so for the nose

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.560 
the eyes and the nose so for the nose
there's<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.780> lot<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.110> there's<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.040> lot<00:02:55.190> of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.960 
there's a lot of there's a lot of
shading<00:02:56.710> and<00:02:57.710> there's<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.040> lot<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.280> gradients

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
shading and there's a lot of gradients

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790 
shading and there's a lot of gradients
and<00:02:59.090> transitions<00:02:59.720> but<00:03:00.230> there's<00:03:00.410> not<00:03:00.590> many

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
and transitions but there's not many

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800 
and transitions but there's not many
distinct<00:03:01.490> lines<00:03:01.700> whereas<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.360> go<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
distinct lines whereas if you go to the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.590 
distinct lines whereas if you go to the
sketch<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.860> see<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.550> basic<00:03:04.790> distinct

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
sketch you can see the basic distinct

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.810 
sketch you can see the basic distinct
lines<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.960> you'd<00:03:06.110> need<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:07.040> draw<00:03:07.310> out<00:03:07.550> and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
lines that you'd need to draw out and

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.420 
lines that you'd need to draw out and
then<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.330> can<00:03:08.480> refer<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.530> photo<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:10.070> do

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
then you can refer to the photo to do

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.940 
then you can refer to the photo to do
all<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.790> shading<00:03:11.360> so<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.470> takes<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.830> lot

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
all the shading so it just takes a lot

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.190 
all the shading so it just takes a lot
of<00:03:13.010> confusion<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.660> giving<00:03:14.900> you

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
of confusion out of it by giving you

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.590 
of confusion out of it by giving you
those<00:03:15.380> basic<00:03:15.860> lines<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.489> need<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.970> draw

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
those basic lines that you need to draw

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.630 
those basic lines that you need to draw
from<00:03:17.900> okay<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.950> first<00:03:19.220> thing<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.459> need<00:03:19.580> to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
from okay so the first thing you need to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.670 
from okay so the first thing you need to
do<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.270> mark<00:03:20.480> out<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.840> reference<00:03:21.260> points

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
do is to mark out the reference points

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.590 
do is to mark out the reference points
so<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.489> mark<00:03:22.640> out<00:03:22.820> either<00:03:23.180> side<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.420> our

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
so you can mark out either side of our

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.140 
so you can mark out either side of our
eyes<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.140> bottom<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.590> nose<00:03:24.830> each<00:03:25.550> side<00:03:25.970> of

the head and these are all main feature
points<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.250> help<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.730> create<00:03:35.180> your<00:03:35.300> drawing

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
points to help you create your drawing

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020 
points to help you create your drawing
you<00:03:36.650> can<00:03:36.680> also<00:03:37.010> do<00:03:37.340> either<00:03:37.730> side<00:03:37.910> about

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
you can also do either side about

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.420 
you can also do either side about
eyebrows<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:39.050> really<00:03:39.410> depends<00:03:39.860> how<00:03:39.980> extreme

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
eyebrows it really depends how extreme

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.040 
eyebrows it really depends how extreme
you<00:03:40.459> want<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.850> go<00:03:41.030> if<00:03:41.270> you're<00:03:41.660> not<00:03:41.870> feeling

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
you want to go if you're not feeling

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.050 
you want to go if you're not feeling
very<00:03:42.380> confident<00:03:42.920> let's<00:03:43.130> start<00:03:43.489> off<00:03:43.640> with<00:03:43.820> more

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
very confident let's start off with more

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.300 
very confident let's start off with more
points<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.600> as<00:03:45.020> you<00:03:45.170> become<00:03:45.320> more<00:03:45.500> confident

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
points and as you become more confident

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.790 
points and as you become more confident
you<00:03:46.400> can<00:03:46.550> use<00:03:46.730> less<00:03:47.000> points<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.660> this<00:03:48.500> really

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
you can use less points and this really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.550 
you can use less points and this really
helps<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.430> get<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.700> more<00:03:49.940> accurate<00:03:49.970> drawing<00:03:50.630> so

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
helps you get a more accurate drawing so

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.710 
helps you get a more accurate drawing so
a<00:03:51.590> lot<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.070> artists<00:03:52.610> use<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.239> method<00:03:53.690> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
a lot of artists use this method to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.380 
a lot of artists use this method to
measure<00:03:54.200> out<00:03:54.500> key<00:03:54.800> points<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.430> then<00:03:55.880> transfer

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
measure out key points and then transfer

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.600 
measure out key points and then transfer
that<00:03:56.420> onto<00:03:56.600> their<00:03:57.080> paper<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:58.310> just<00:03:58.489> gives

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
that onto their paper and it just gives

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.280 
that onto their paper and it just gives
you<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> really<00:03:59.060> good<00:03:59.090> foundation<00:03:59.840> of<00:03:59.959> where<00:04:00.140> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
you a really good foundation of where to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.890 
you a really good foundation of where to
start<00:04:00.590> also<00:04:01.459> for<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:01.910> method<00:04:02.360> your<00:04:02.570> paper

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
start also for this method your paper

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.990 
start also for this method your paper
needs<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.380> be<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.739> same<00:04:03.980> size<00:04:04.310> as<00:04:04.580> your

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
needs to be the same size as your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.050 
needs to be the same size as your
reference<00:04:05.570> photo<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.110> make<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.620> work<00:04:06.830> okay<00:04:07.160> so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
reference photo to make it work okay so

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.820 
reference photo to make it work okay so
to<00:04:08.269> mark<00:04:08.570> out<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.900> point<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.320> take<00:04:09.530> the

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
to mark out the point you take the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.350 
to mark out the point you take the
vertical<00:04:10.310> measurement<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> horizontal

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
vertical measurement and the horizontal

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.120 
vertical measurement and the horizontal
measurement<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.350> then<00:04:12.500> just<00:04:12.739> map<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.100> out

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
measurement and then just map that out

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.330 
measurement and then just map that out
onto<00:04:13.670> your<00:04:13.730> paper<00:04:14.380> make<00:04:15.380> sure<00:04:15.440> that<00:04:15.769> you<00:04:15.920> do<00:04:16.220> at

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
onto your paper make sure that you do at

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.740 
onto your paper make sure that you do at
the<00:04:16.370> same<00:04:16.700> side<00:04:17.000> as<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.450> took<00:04:17.600> the

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
the same side as you took the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.990 
the same side as you took the
measurement<00:04:18.230> from

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
measurement from

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.150 
measurement from
so<00:04:19.480> if<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.780> took<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.170> from<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.620> left-hand

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
so if you took it from the left-hand

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.640 
so if you took it from the left-hand
side<00:04:21.250> then<00:04:22.210> make<00:04:22.390> sure<00:04:22.420> that<00:04:22.810> you<00:04:22.900> do<00:04:23.620> that

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
side then make sure that you do that

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.170 
side then make sure that you do that
measurement<00:04:24.160> on<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.370> left-hand<00:04:24.790> side<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:25.090> the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
measurement on the left-hand side of the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.880 
measurement on the left-hand side of the
paper<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:28.450> just<00:04:28.690> keep<00:04:28.900> doing<00:04:29.170> this<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:29.680> all<00:04:29.860> of

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
paper so just keep doing this for all of

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.340 
paper so just keep doing this for all of
the<00:04:30.220> points<00:04:30.670> and<00:04:30.850> I'm<00:04:31.480> using<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.900> black<00:04:32.110> pen

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
the points and I'm using a black pen

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.690 
the points and I'm using a black pen
here<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:32.980> I<00:04:33.070> want<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.310> stand<00:04:33.520> out<00:04:33.640> on

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
here because I want to stand out on

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.610 
here because I want to stand out on
camera<00:04:34.150> but<00:04:34.360> when<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.630> do<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:35.200> use<00:04:35.380> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
camera but when you do it just use a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.700 
camera but when you do it just use a
pencil<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.270> do<00:04:37.570> it<00:04:37.690> very<00:04:37.870> lightly<00:04:38.050> so

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
pencil and just do it very lightly so

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.700 
pencil and just do it very lightly so
that<00:04:38.980> it's<00:04:39.130> easy<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.550> rub<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:40.410> before<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.560> do

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that it's easy to rub out before you do

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.070 
that it's easy to rub out before you do
each<00:04:41.860> point<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.640> help<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:43.120> try<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:43.660> become

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
each point to help you try and become

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.250 
each point to help you try and become
better<00:04:44.500> with<00:04:44.800> your<00:04:44.920> accuracy<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:46.020> mark<00:04:47.020> out

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
better with your accuracy just mark out

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.230 
better with your accuracy just mark out
where<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.620> think<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.190> would<00:04:48.310> go<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.790> then

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
where you think it would go and then

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.940 
where you think it would go and then
once<00:04:49.510> you<00:04:49.660> mark<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.050> out<00:04:50.230> using<00:04:50.620> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
once you mark it out using the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.410 
once you mark it out using the
measurements<00:04:51.490> see<00:04:51.760> what<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.180> did

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
measurements see what you did

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.330 
measurements see what you did
differently<00:04:52.570> see<00:04:53.200> if<00:04:53.260> yours<00:04:53.500> was<00:04:53.620> too<00:04:53.830> high<00:04:54.100> or

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
differently see if yours was too high or

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.610 
differently see if yours was too high or
too<00:04:54.370> low<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:55.030> see<00:04:55.450> if<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.690> are<00:04:55.810> consistently

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
too low and see if you are consistently

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.800 
too low and see if you are consistently
doing<00:04:57.040> something<00:04:57.640> too<00:04:57.820> high<00:04:58.060> or<00:04:58.210> too<00:04:58.240> low<00:04:58.450> or

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
doing something too high or too low or

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.840 
doing something too high or too low or
what<00:04:59.350> you're<00:04:59.500> doing<00:04:59.890> that's<00:05:00.040> different<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
what you're doing that's different and

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.120 
what you're doing that's different and
why<00:05:01.420> you<00:05:01.480> think<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.170> should<00:05:02.440> be<00:05:02.470> there<00:05:02.830> and

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
why you think it should be there and

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.880 
why you think it should be there and
hopefully<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.300> will<00:05:04.450> train<00:05:04.750> your<00:05:04.930> brain<00:05:05.080> and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
hopefully this will train your brain and

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.130 
hopefully this will train your brain and
make<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.250> think<00:05:06.610> about<00:05:06.840> where<00:05:07.840> things

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
make you think about where things

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.440 
make you think about where things
actually<00:05:08.290> are<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.370> that's<00:05:09.460> really<00:05:09.760> all<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.090> did

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
actually are so that's really all I did

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.930 
actually are so that's really all I did
to<00:05:10.690> improve<00:05:11.050> my<00:05:11.230> accuracy<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:12.130> this<00:05:12.669> just

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
to improve my accuracy and this just

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.210 
to improve my accuracy and this just
seemed<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.270> work<00:05:13.480> for<00:05:13.750> me<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.620> if<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.040> have

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
seemed to work for me so if you have

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.740 
seemed to work for me so if you have
lots<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.550> points<00:05:15.880> joined<00:05:16.120> out<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.540> just

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
lots of points joined out it's just

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.640 
lots of points joined out it's just
really<00:05:17.050> easy<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.770> join<00:05:18.040> them<00:05:18.310> up<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:19.650> it's

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
really easy to join them up and it's

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.350 
really easy to join them up and it's
just<00:05:20.740> easy<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.280> get<00:05:21.460> more<00:05:21.850> accurate<00:05:22.240> drawing

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
just easy to get more accurate drawing

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.450 
just easy to get more accurate drawing
because<00:05:22.720> you<00:05:22.780> have<00:05:22.930> less<00:05:23.169> places<00:05:23.470> to<00:05:23.980> go<00:05:24.130> wrong

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
because you have less places to go wrong

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.940 
because you have less places to go wrong
because<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.600> already<00:05:25.870> got<00:05:26.110> those<00:05:26.440> reference

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
because you already got those reference

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.610 
because you already got those reference
points<00:05:27.070> that<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.880> know<00:05:28.030> you<00:05:28.090> have<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.540> meet<00:05:28.750> so

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
points that you know you have to meet so

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.740 
points that you know you have to meet so
definitely<00:05:30.280> as<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.430> get<00:05:30.760> better<00:05:31.000> use<00:05:31.419> less

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
definitely as you get better use less

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.690 
definitely as you get better use less
points<00:05:32.230> or<00:05:32.680> if<00:05:32.830> you<00:05:32.980> think<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.310> can<00:05:33.460> do<00:05:33.610> it

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
points or if you think you can do it

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.090 
points or if you think you can do it
without<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:34.180> points<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.380> say<00:05:35.560> if<00:05:35.650> you<00:05:35.740> do<00:05:35.860> want

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
without the points so say if you do want

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.710 
without the points so say if you do want
our<00:05:36.220> eyebrow<00:05:36.669> using<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.120> points<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:37.600> you

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
our eyebrow using the points and you

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.990 
our eyebrow using the points and you
think<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.110> can<00:05:38.290> do<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:39.430> next<00:05:39.610> one<00:05:39.850> without

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
think you can do it the next one without

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.420 
think you can do it the next one without
them<00:05:40.450> then<00:05:40.660> don't<00:05:40.840> use<00:05:41.169> them<00:05:41.470> try<00:05:42.250> do<00:05:42.310> it

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
them then don't use them try do it

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.280 
them then don't use them try do it
yourself<00:05:43.030> and<00:05:43.270> then<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.630> always<00:05:43.750> check

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
yourself and then you can always check

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.950 
yourself and then you can always check
to<00:05:45.100> see<00:05:45.340> whether<00:05:45.580> your<00:05:45.820> points<00:05:46.240> match<00:05:46.479> up<00:05:46.780> and

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
to see whether your points match up and

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.430 
to see whether your points match up and
if<00:05:47.080> not<00:05:47.320> just<00:05:47.380> rub<00:05:47.800> it<00:05:47.830> out<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.250> do<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:48.400> again

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
if not just rub it out and do it again

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.659 
if not just rub it out and do it again
another<00:05:50.440> thing<00:05:50.650> I<00:05:50.740> want<00:05:50.950> to<00:05:51.010> mention<00:05:51.220> is

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
another thing I want to mention is

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.200 
another thing I want to mention is
always<00:05:52.419> do<00:05:52.720> your<00:05:52.930> sketch<00:05:53.229> up<00:05:53.470> first<00:05:53.710> never

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
always do your sketch up first never

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.790 
always do your sketch up first never
draw<00:05:55.210> out<00:05:55.419> and<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.660> then<00:05:55.930> shade<00:05:56.290> it<00:05:56.530> and<00:05:56.680> then

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
draw out and I then shade it and then

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.040 
draw out and I then shade it and then
draw<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.040> rest<00:05:57.370> out<00:05:57.610> always<00:05:58.090> do<00:05:58.330> your<00:05:58.540> outline

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
draw the rest out always do your outline

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.560 
draw the rest out always do your outline
sketch<00:05:59.680> first<00:05:59.950> before<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.640> do<00:06:00.760> any<00:06:01.000> drawing

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
sketch first before you do any drawing

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.870 
sketch first before you do any drawing
this<00:06:02.200> is<00:06:02.380> because<00:06:02.680> if<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:03.010> shade<00:06:03.400> an<00:06:03.700> eye

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
this is because if you shade an eye

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.820 
this is because if you shade an eye
awesome<00:06:04.060> thing<00:06:04.600> then<00:06:05.050> you<00:06:05.200> realize<00:06:05.500> it's<00:06:05.710> in

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
awesome thing then you realize it's in

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.040 
awesome thing then you realize it's in
the<00:06:05.919> wrong<00:06:06.130> place<00:06:06.490> then<00:06:07.030> it's<00:06:07.210> really<00:06:07.630> hard<00:06:07.870> to

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
the wrong place then it's really hard to

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.360 
the wrong place then it's really hard to
rub<00:06:08.229> it<00:06:08.350> out<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:08.770> will<00:06:08.860> just<00:06:09.070> leave<00:06:09.340> you

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
rub it out and it will just leave you

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.219 
rub it out and it will just leave you
with<00:06:10.200> muddy<00:06:11.200> looking<00:06:11.500> dirty<00:06:12.430> paper<00:06:12.729> and<00:06:13.229> it

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
with muddy looking dirty paper and it

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.350 
with muddy looking dirty paper and it
just<00:06:14.590> damages<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.190> paper<00:06:15.430> as<00:06:15.700> well<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.270> it

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
just damages the paper as well and it

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.840 
just damages the paper as well and it
you<00:06:16.510> just<00:06:16.540> want<00:06:16.870> to<00:06:16.960> get<00:06:17.080> it<00:06:17.229> white<00:06:17.440> again<00:06:17.860> you

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
you just want to get it white again you

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.670 
you just want to get it white again you
can<00:06:19.000> also<00:06:19.120> use<00:06:19.390> a<00:06:19.419> pencil<00:06:19.780> to<00:06:20.050> mark<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:20.620> out

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
can also use a pencil to mark it out

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.100 
can also use a pencil to mark it out
it's<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:21.790> lot<00:06:21.940> quicker<00:06:22.180> so<00:06:22.630> if<00:06:22.780> you<00:06:22.930> just

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
it's a lot quicker so if you just

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.140 
it's a lot quicker so if you just
measure<00:06:23.740> things<00:06:24.190> out<00:06:24.430> on<00:06:24.460> your<00:06:24.790> own

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
measure things out on your own

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.000 
measure things out on your own
pencil<00:06:25.600> to<00:06:25.720> see<00:06:25.900> where<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.169> comes<00:06:26.320> up<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.830> so

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
pencil to see where it comes up to so

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.469 
pencil to see where it comes up to so
I'm<00:06:27.070> using<00:06:27.280> mechanical<00:06:27.789> pencil<00:06:28.120> so<00:06:28.300> it<00:06:28.330> has<00:06:28.450> a

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
I'm using mechanical pencil so it has a

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.900 
I'm using mechanical pencil so it has a
lot<00:06:28.720> of<00:06:28.750> different<00:06:29.169> points<00:06:29.680> and<00:06:29.860> then<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:30.729> can

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
lot of different points and then you can

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.040 
lot of different points and then you can
really<00:06:31.210> quickly

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
really quickly

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.230 
really quickly
see<00:06:32.139> where<00:06:32.830> each<00:06:32.860> point<00:06:33.370> should<00:06:33.550> go<00:06:33.729> using<00:06:34.030> the

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
see where each point should go using the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.059 
see where each point should go using the
pencil<00:06:34.479> and<00:06:35.110> then<00:06:35.229> you<00:06:35.349> can<00:06:35.500> check<00:06:35.740> it<00:06:35.919> with<00:06:36.039> a

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
pencil and then you can check it with a

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
to do it and it's a way that most

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.529

and just take points of where they think

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
it should go and it just really makes it
