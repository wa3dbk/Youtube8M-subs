00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
button so really cool so anyway on the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.340 
button so really cool so anyway on the
top<00:01:05.180> of<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.420> screen<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.869> pause<00:01:06.110> button

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.149 

so<00:01:14.780> there<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.049> go<00:01:15.080> we<00:01:15.320> lost<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.680> good<00:01:15.830> amount<00:01:15.890> of
