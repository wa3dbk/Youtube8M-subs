 7,500 cuda color plates 12 gb of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.440
 memory that will arrive on April 29 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.270
 most likely one or two 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.059
 months later here in Brazil cnbb decided 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.300
 The sign is right here and we're going. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 power a price of a boom in the world 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.480

 gamer being so expensive only that we are 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.189
 seeing a positioning of the athletes is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.390
 different from what happened in the past 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.100
 because until then z 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.750
 in the market for erp stations 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 3 million for a workstation face 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 face of development may 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.860
 much sense to pay three thousand reais 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 Strange saints have pass here will not 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.770
 get here in our hands right 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.650
 God do not think I do not think 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.110
 minutes where they do operation wedge 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.570
 limousine population pcs 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.970
 it was really cool because each MP is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.100
 has a story they said 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 each mp will have a different interaction 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.350
 a history the name 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.030
 this is going to be a much bigger company 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.220
 very revolutionary I hope that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.040
 Do not be so simple as that. 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.080

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
 use of this rockstar delay in 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.620
 welding k-5 for pc and the guys will 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.720
 keeping it so there are not any 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.569

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.560

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.329

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.670

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.040
 very clearly that they are 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.989
 developing a jetpack schedule 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.989
 jec key twist 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.930
 I even feel for you first I thought 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.599
 I was going to the tech jette's house to pick up 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 the jec was that it was felt the lack of 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.010
 technicians and was thus one of the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.019
 great trumps of the saints only appearing 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.940
 What are you talking about and they did not even say 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.920
 I'm liking him blind. I think that 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.690
 thing to be a little more than 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.239
 help but I think it will be worth it 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.250
 Because it's going to be a very beautiful space. 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.579
 he was really going to do after the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.340
