00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 It hurts, we're not cards, you have to forget the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 favor because we are walking in your 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.949
 Armor has no equipment 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 communication was like this. 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 while how much basic photo level to 293 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.670
 miles there in two hours 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.200
 we will be at home everything will go to a place 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.200
 sure what happened? 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:58.570
 the captain of the team was the player 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.070
 I found the pink doctor ball too. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.420
 coming for now there was something 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.420
 worrying a little 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.790
 expensive 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.820
 we stayed with looking everywhere 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.350
 rights out of the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.120
 take away from requiem for these 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.340
 things do not enter the controls now 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.020
 no response captain henry caught in the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 capital position look here 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.550
 the artifact is holding us by acting 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.950
 as an anchor gibbs made the links useful 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.780
 not a physicist, does not expect much 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.870
 We do not know about the bay eclipses are 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.500
 you should have fixed it straight there 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.500
 several days 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.940
 I'm stinging, damn it 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:59.030
 It was a quick action, they came here just to 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 get there some of these belonged to the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:08.660
 doors 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:19.760
 my thanks good 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:22.150
 you see, you 're taking all the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.150
 good stuff 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.910
 Look what this is. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.980
 beauty 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.980
 I got a map 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.470
 captain Lesc Admiral Osman saw 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.990
 report about doctor roger me 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.670
 told to keep Katherine in the hole. 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.150
 dark or deep or remove the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.890
 totally in equation 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.500
 unfortunately pt does not do this so 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.970
 capital 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.970
 today I must follow the advice of my 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.950
 predecessor and now I command that eliminates 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.950
 the doctor katherine heigl 11 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.590
 I think you the power to search 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.590
 knowledge is power 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.580
 glass even did this would not have so much 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.950
 assurance 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:59.400
 the protective shield is emanating from the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:05:04.280
 own structure and if I am sure the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.280
 access requires a more human touch
