may need I'm going to take some stone
for<00:00:09.809> now<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.170> make<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> base<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.460> house

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
for now and make a base of that house

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.299 
for now and make a base of that house
pretty<00:00:12.210> much<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> we're<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:13.860> going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> go

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
pretty much so we're just going to go

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.130 
pretty much so we're just going to go
about<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:17.600> if<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> make<00:00:19.050> it

super super neat like the walls too wide

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.320 
super super neat like the walls too wide
because<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.470> will<00:00:22.949> require<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:24.109> and<00:00:25.109> then

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
ok now you can take a switch like so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.539 
ok now you can take a switch like so
lever<00:01:44.180> whatever<00:01:45.180> doesn't<00:01:45.840> matter<00:01:46.220> up<00:01:47.220> throw

lever whatever doesn't matter up throw
mine<00:01:47.869> here<00:01:51.020> now<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.590> run<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> switch

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.530 

from<00:02:03.010> you<00:02:04.010> can<00:02:04.220> make<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.820> neater<00:02:05.120> I'm<00:02:05.360> just

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
from you can make this neater I'm just

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.020 
from you can make this neater I'm just
kind<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.750> giving<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.020> an<00:02:06.170> example<00:02:06.850> grab<00:02:07.850> some

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
kind of giving you an example grab some

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:19.330 
kind of giving you an example grab some
redstone<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.300> activate<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:19.130> now

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
redstone going to activate this so now

00:02:19.340 --> 00:03:07.660 
redstone going to activate this so now
when<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.580> works

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.899 

bring<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.790> around<00:03:08.879> here<00:03:13.219> and<00:03:14.219> that<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.549> can<00:03:14.760> go

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
bring it around here and that one can go

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:23.059 
bring it around here and that one can go
up<00:03:16.129> then<00:03:17.129> you<00:03:17.219> can<00:03:17.400> bring<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:19.670> this<00:03:20.670> way<00:03:22.069> you

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
up then you can bring it this way you

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.729 
up then you can bring it this way you
need<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.840> know<00:03:27.959> it'll<00:03:28.290> lift<00:03:28.500> up

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
need to and then you know it'll lift up

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:36.520 
need to and then you know it'll lift up
Oh<00:03:31.730> flip<00:03:32.730> off<00:03:32.969> we'll<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:33.959> down<00:03:34.639> clothes<00:03:35.639> off

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
Oh flip off we'll go down clothes off

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.229 
Oh flip off we'll go down clothes off
you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:37.829> one<00:03:38.099> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.489> do<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.969> doesn't

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
you can do one you can do to it doesn't

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.809 
you can do one you can do to it doesn't
matter<00:03:39.919> you<00:03:40.919> can<00:03:40.950> also<00:03:41.280> do<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:41.879> with<00:03:43.819> pressure

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
matter you can also do it with pressure

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.679 
matter you can also do it with pressure
plates<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.689> whatever<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.189> is<00:03:47.370> easier

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
plates or whatever but this is easier

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:56.569 
plates or whatever but this is easier
take<00:03:48.689> two<00:03:49.680> switches<00:03:52.219> this<00:03:55.370> there's<00:03:56.370> some

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
take two switches this there's some

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:04.819 
take two switches this there's some
redstone<00:03:56.790> down<00:03:58.459> this<00:03:59.459> way<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:03.379> now<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.439> can

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
redstone down this way and now you can

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.149 
redstone down this way and now you can
do<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.280> light<00:04:05.519> switches<00:04:06.409> at<00:04:07.409> one<00:04:07.620> side<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:08.099> you

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
do to light switches at one side and you

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.080 
do to light switches at one side and you
get<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.400> other<00:04:08.720> flip<00:04:09.720> them<00:04:09.900> off<00:04:10.049> or<00:04:11.000> if<00:04:12.000> you

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
get the other flip them off or if you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.969 
get the other flip them off or if you
want<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.299> take<00:04:12.479> the<00:04:12.930> time<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.379> combine<00:04:13.739> them

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
want to take the time to combine them

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.399 
want to take the time to combine them
underground<00:04:14.280> or<00:04:14.849> anywhere<00:04:15.389> like<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.599> to

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
underground or anywhere like that to

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.110 
underground or anywhere like that to
make<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.650> look<00:04:16.739> nice<00:04:17.009> you<00:04:17.639> go<00:04:17.789> ahead<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:17.970> do
