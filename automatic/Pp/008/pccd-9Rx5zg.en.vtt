00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello for a long time on some site 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.740
 I saw a recipe for homemade mayonnaise plant 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 2 probably was back tried to do it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.630
 Loved a lot 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 video about this thing that we need 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.280
 for homemade mayonnaise is a tea 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:43.649
 a spoonful of sugar a half a teaspoon can be 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:47.070
 even less need syllables a little lemon 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.030
 juice but again, to taste I took here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 where is the floor of the hand such a 50 gram egg 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.390
 ground black pepper and I ran out 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.839
 so I will use red and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 here how many there are probably 300 400 400 grams 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.410
 I left this sunflower oil without 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410
 the smell 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.730
 shore up you will need another blender and here 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.250
 such a jar why not a jar 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.100
 separate some kind of well this is because we 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:29.440
 close the lid and let us be in the fridge 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.440
 this store fill egg 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.380
 add night our ingredients no salt i 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.570
 Still, not all will pour 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 somewhere half as planned 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:06.100
 here is sugar pour out all the lemon juice 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:33.050
 so am I about pepper 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:35.890
 forgot a little pepper add oil 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.890
 Little 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:54.610
 let's start beating with our old blender 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.610
 Soviet 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 pour in 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.580
 so after two or three minutes of beating and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.900
 adding oil we have here 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:00.930
 such a product the more oil we add 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.600
 so he will be vegetables and I became everything 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.600
 add he even left a little bit 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.360
 try to give you see how thick it is 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:30.010
 it turned out very tasty 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:36.060
 natural product without any there 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:41.860
 emulsifiers and additives and total 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:46.300
 the rest of what we have modern life 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:55.080
 so to speak, well, I can still 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:57.100
 add that this sauce is not a sauce - 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.470
 can serve as a basis for 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.630
 making homemade sauces there 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.280
 what can different add there 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:13.570
 spices there dill what's another one that 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.790
 to your taste you can 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.130

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.270
