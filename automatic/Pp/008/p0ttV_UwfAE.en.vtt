00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.650
 we had a portal and also great 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.540
 sand connection true so it seems not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.550
 everything was thought out differently after I'd 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.920
 not as a tribute to electrical tape and now you can 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.920
 so here is the number to put the lab 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.330

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 sand from this list get rid of 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.960
 is crazy 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.060
 the portal we got there I found myself 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.869
 not this way 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.820
 so well I already climbed this chest and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.399
 completely, quite by accident, I threw out 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.090
 the book that there you were probably 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.970
 it is written that there the author was also marked 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.509
 foxy he well I don't know of course there was 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.670
 written but the main thing we have 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.429
 achievements and riot after on reaching 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 your written I do not know but the main thing is 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.600
 there are many of us here who are Russians 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.420
 slugs and many bubbles experience book 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.870
 will be quite tea forgot what I have 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.330
 and moved to another key 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.710
 well, sense kew to another like noodles 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.540
 rearrange 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:41.030
 so that fractions us and not accidentally with all the tea 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.560
 so below us i know coal to make sense if 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.680
 I dig it 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 coal we have 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.260
 all you can go from here just 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.260
 portal portal 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.670
 portos can be completed 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.480

 punctate can be demolished 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.140
 So 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:35.230

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.580
 About 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.969
 to this 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.650
 so this is what 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.150
 and this is our sword 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.990

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.440

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.440
 what can be put 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.889
 I do not know what to put my put 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.490
 Although with stone I will show for now 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.490
 I use 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.459
 so hatchet can 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.560
 I'm going to get everything 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.620
 let's see what we have there gold. 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.640
 gold pickaxe kirkin 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.360
 and paddle blades 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.360
 arrow 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.849
 everything 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.169
 So 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.169
 we already have gold 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.480
 okay i'm scooping up courses and 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.860
 show you how it is excavated you look 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.310
 so okay okay i will show you how i am 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.700
 I dig that I found diamonds so immediately decided 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.800
 to show 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.120
 and from a little bit down fluffed were 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.120
 already created 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.309
 holes here I here put the sandstone 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:52.300
 so as not to fail the very 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:57.790
 so I forgot about such tactics as here 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.070
 this and look at women 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.690
 so the main dishonest lower block is not 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.920
 get there because if i get him 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:11.529
 then there is an abyss or rod that if there 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.949
 the abyss of water is so dangerous 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.949
 heck 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.680
 he and so 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.760
 and so 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.110
 all of us and not all so 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.110
 Now I would fly 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:36.490
 even red dust will fall from there 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.490
 it's not going anywhere 

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.990
 and you can do 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.150
 dig it out 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:56.280
 you are 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.380
 so many fields are already nice 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.050
 there is a little bit but still I will fall 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.480
 Okay, this is a long process, but not so much 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:07.830
 long and yet boring uninteresting 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.040
 so I often do everything and show the van 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.040
 qing
