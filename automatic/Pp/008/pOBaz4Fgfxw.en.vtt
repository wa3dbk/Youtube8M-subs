00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to the door that opens but you know that

to the door that opens but you know that
the<00:01:15.510> collars<00:01:15.870> need<00:01:16.080> batteries<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the collars need batteries and if you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.680 
the collars need batteries and if you
lose<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.250> collar<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.730> know<00:01:17.910> all<00:01:18.180> things<00:01:18.420> can

happen<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.680> always<00:01:20.100> works<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.660> chose<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
happen this always works so we chose a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
happen this always works so we chose a
pet<00:01:22.200> door<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> flap<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.970> we

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pet door that has a flap and then we

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.250 
pet door that has a flap and then we
have<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> security<00:01:24.720> panel<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> inside

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
looked at lots of features but we also

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.000 
looked at lots of features but we also
had<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.610> measure<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:34.320> measure<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.830> dog

they<00:01:55.980> need<00:01:56.160> cuz<00:01:56.550> they<00:01:56.640> naturally<00:01:57.120> duct<00:01:57.570> their

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
they need cuz they naturally duct their

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.180 
they need cuz they naturally duct their
head<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.440> through<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:58.800> opening

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
head when they go through this opening

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.830 
head when they go through this opening
anyway<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> whit<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.650> had<00:02:01.800> our<00:02:02.570> idea<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
anyway so whit we had our idea of the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
anyway so whit we had our idea of the
door<00:02:04.080> which<00:02:04.260> we<00:02:04.440> wanted<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:05.040> had<00:02:05.190> our<00:02:05.340> dog<00:02:05.550> size

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
door which we wanted we had our dog size

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.630 
door which we wanted we had our dog size
we<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:06.810> went<00:02:06.990> looked<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.410> doors<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.009> we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
we then went looked at doors and we

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.340 
we then went looked at doors and we
chose<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.149> indoor<00:02:09.450> pet

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
chose the indoor pet

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.130 
chose the indoor pet
u-dor<00:02:10.650> a<00:02:10.710> flap<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.220> door<00:02:11.520> because<00:02:12.080> some<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
u-dor a flap that door because some of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.840 
u-dor a flap that door because some of
the<00:02:13.230> features<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:13.710> had<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.400> appealed<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the features they had really appealed to

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.080 
the features they had really appealed to
us

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
us

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.990 
us
for<00:02:15.660> instance<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.620> had<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.010> flexible<00:02:17.640> flap

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
for instance they had this flexible flap

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.960 
for instance they had this flexible flap
in<00:02:18.300> effect<00:02:19.080> there's<00:02:19.830> two<00:02:20.100> flaps<00:02:20.460> here

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
in effect there's two flaps here

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.480 
in effect there's two flaps here
it's<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.600> 2x6<00:02:22.290> wall<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.800> there's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.010> flap<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
it's a 2x6 wall so there's a flap on the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's a 2x6 wall so there's a flap on the
inner<00:02:23.790> there's<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> flap<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.990> outer<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
inner there's a flap on the outer and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
inner there's a flap on the outer and
those<00:02:25.830> two<00:02:26.100> flaps<00:02:26.460> create<00:02:26.970> an<00:02:27.090> airspace<00:02:27.630> which

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
those two flaps create an airspace which

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.780 
those two flaps create an airspace which
really<00:02:28.500> help<00:02:28.740> keep<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.070> heat<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.490> in<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
really help keep the heat in in the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.420 
really help keep the heat in in the
winter<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> cooling<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> summer

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
winter and the cooling in the summer

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
winter and the cooling in the summer
those<00:02:32.430> flaps<00:02:32.880> are<00:02:33.210> very<00:02:33.570> flexible<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.350> they

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
those flaps are very flexible and they

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
those flaps are very flexible and they
just<00:02:34.710> pivot<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.670> beauty<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> flexibility

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
just pivot the beauty of the flexibility

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
just pivot the beauty of the flexibility
is<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.140> dog<00:02:37.380> starts<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.400> through<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
is if the dog starts to go through and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.220 
is if the dog starts to go through and

get scared and backs out they're not

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.230 
get scared and backs out they're not
going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> pinch<00:02:40.770> their<00:02:40.980> body<00:02:41.220> parts<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.060> get

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
going to pinch their body parts and get

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.760 
going to pinch their body parts and get

hurt the other thing about the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.010 
hurt the other thing about the
flexibility<00:02:44.400> built<00:02:44.640> into<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.330> UV<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
magnets both flaps have magnets on three

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.430 
magnets both flaps have magnets on three
sides<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.820> door<00:02:57.090> seals<00:02:57.570> shut<00:02:58.050> it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
sides so that the door seals shut it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.560 
sides so that the door seals shut it
keeps<00:02:58.710> out<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.890> wind<00:02:59.310> keeps<00:03:00.000> out<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.180> rain

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
keeps out the wind keeps out the rain

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.900 
keeps out the wind keeps out the rain
that's<00:03:01.050> in<00:03:01.200> fact<00:03:01.380> rated<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> 50<00:03:02.250> miles<00:03:02.520> an<00:03:02.790> hour

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
that's in fact rated to 50 miles an hour

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.330 
that's in fact rated to 50 miles an hour
and<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.840> actual<00:03:04.200> pivot<00:03:04.500> portion<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.190> this

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
and the actual pivot portion of this

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.810 
and the actual pivot portion of this
flap<00:03:05.640> they<00:03:06.150> tested<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.020> think<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.650> was<00:03:07.820> three

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
flap they tested it I think it was three

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.880 
flap they tested it I think it was three
million<00:03:09.120> times<00:03:09.570> which<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> equivalent<00:03:10.560> of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
million times which is the equivalent of

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.420 
million times which is the equivalent of
opening<00:03:11.460> closing<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.120> flap<00:03:12.980> one<00:03:13.980> hundred

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
opening closing that flap one hundred

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.760 
opening closing that flap one hundred
yeah<00:03:15.090> hundred<00:03:15.540> times<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.900> day<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.320> 80<00:03:16.500> years

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
yeah hundred times a day for 80 years

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.310 
yeah hundred times a day for 80 years
that's<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.460> lot<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.790> testing<00:03:18.180> that's<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.020> lot<00:03:19.290> of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
that's a lot of testing that's a lot of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.550 
that's a lot of testing that's a lot of
use<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.860> will<00:03:20.130> never<00:03:20.280> use<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.640> door<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.970> much

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
use I will never use the door that much

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.220 
use I will never use the door that much
so<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.160> features<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.880> liked<00:03:24.150> those<00:03:25.020> will

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so the features that we liked those will

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.230 
so the features that we liked those will
them<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:26.070> also<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.550> fact<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:27.000> there's

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
them we also like the fact that there's

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.570 
them we also like the fact that there's
a<00:03:27.330> tunnel<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.620> basically<00:03:29.100> connects

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
a tunnel that that basically connects

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.309 
a tunnel that that basically connects
the<00:03:29.760> two<00:03:29.910> flaps<00:03:30.240> together<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.990> this

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
the two flaps together so this

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.369 
the two flaps together so this
inside<00:03:31.950> wall<00:03:32.340> space<00:03:32.760> water<00:03:33.689> to<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.079> into<00:03:34.230> a

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
inside wall space water to get into a

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.920 
inside wall space water to get into a
dog<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:35.099> get<00:03:35.219> their<00:03:35.400> paws<00:03:35.700> cut<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.749> just

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
dog to get their paws cut it it's just

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.910 
dog to get their paws cut it it's just
an<00:03:37.139> aluminum<00:03:37.469> tunnel<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:39.569> we<00:03:39.900> did<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
an aluminum tunnel so we did that the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.489 
an aluminum tunnel so we did that the
next<00:03:41.189> thing<00:03:41.340> was<00:03:41.459> let's<00:03:42.180> install<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:42.810> where

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:43.499 
next thing was let's install this where

or affect the aesthetics of the home I
chose<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.609> location<00:03:53.819> for<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.389> few<00:03:54.659> reasons

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
chose this location for a few reasons

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.990 
chose this location for a few reasons
it's<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.680> covered<00:03:56.040> porch<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.579> don't<00:03:56.819> have<00:03:56.909> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
it's a covered porch so I don't have to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.869 
it's a covered porch so I don't have to
shovel<00:03:57.389> where<00:03:57.870> they<00:03:57.989> exit<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.639> don't<00:03:59.639> worry

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
shovel where they exit I don't worry

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.720 
shovel where they exit I don't worry
about<00:04:00.060> rain<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:01.349> exits<00:04:01.769> into<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.069> fenced-in

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
about rain it exits into a fenced-in

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.800 
about rain it exits into a fenced-in
yard<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.560> enters<00:04:05.040> into<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.639> mudroom<00:04:06.030> closet

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
yard and it enters into a mudroom closet

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690 
yard and it enters into a mudroom closet
so<00:04:06.959> I<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.200> actually<00:04:07.319> close<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.799> closet<00:04:08.340> off

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
so I can actually close that closet off

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.879 
so I can actually close that closet off
and<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.180> restrict<00:04:09.719> them<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.230> closet<00:04:10.799> if

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
and just restrict them to that closet if

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.589 
and just restrict them to that closet if
I<00:04:10.980> want<00:04:11.219> them<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.579> from<00:04:11.819> going<00:04:12.060> away<00:04:12.329> or

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
my inside and outside exact holes we

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.020 
my inside and outside exact holes we
trace<00:05:07.740> those<00:05:07.979> holes<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.550> cut<00:05:08.759> them<00:05:08.880> out

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030
