the way up and down the piano anytime

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
the way up and down the piano anytime
you<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> group<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> 2<00:00:51.539> black<00:00:51.809> notes<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you see a group of 2 black notes the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
you see a group of 2 black notes the
first<00:00:52.440> note<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> left<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> seat

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
first note right to the left is a seat

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.880 
first note right to the left is a seat
now<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> reason<00:00:54.660> i'm<00:00:54.899> starting<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.469> c

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
now the reason i'm starting with c

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
now the reason i'm starting with c
instead<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.149> might<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> might

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
instead of like a which might you might

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
instead of like a which might you might
think<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.140> normal<00:00:58.469> since<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> alphabet

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
think would be normal since the alphabet

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
think would be normal since the alphabet
starts<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> day<00:00:59.520> it's<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:00.750> we

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
starts a day it's just because when we

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
starts a day it's just because when we
start<00:01:01.079> learning<00:01:01.410> scales<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.129> stuff<00:01:02.460> c

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
start learning scales and other stuff c

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810 
start learning scales and other stuff c
is<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> easiest<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:05.159> easiest<00:01:05.549> scale

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is like the easiest the easiest scale

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
is like the easiest the easiest scale
and<00:01:06.030> note<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.590> makes<00:01:07.860> sense

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and note to work with so it makes sense

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.310 
and note to work with so it makes sense
as<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> logical<00:01:08.790> starting<00:01:09.000> point<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.930> anyway

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
as a logical starting point so anyway

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
as a logical starting point so anyway
what<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> need<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.909> find<00:01:12.240> this

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what you all you need to do is find this

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.490 
what you all you need to do is find this
see<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:14.210> knowing<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.810> notes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
see here and then knowing that the notes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.270 
see here and then knowing that the notes
are<00:01:16.860> labeled<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.270> well<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.229> through<00:01:19.979> g

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
are labeled either a well a through g

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
are labeled either a well a through g
only<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> white<00:01:20.909> notes<00:01:21.119> A<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.540> G<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
only the white notes A through G if this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
only the white notes A through G if this
is<00:01:22.680> C<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> figure<00:01:23.610> we'll<00:01:23.909> figure

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
is C we can kind of figure we'll figure

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
is C we can kind of figure we'll figure
out<00:01:24.360> where<00:01:24.570> everywhere<00:01:24.810> everything<00:01:25.409> else<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
out where everywhere everything else is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.600 
out where everywhere everything else is
right<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> C<00:01:27.090> here's<00:01:27.479> B<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
right so if this is C here's B and

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
right so if this is C here's B and
here's<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.170> start<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
here's a right so if we start at a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.810 
here's a right so if we start at a
that's<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> alphabet<00:01:32.340> start<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that's like where the alphabet start so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
that's like where the alphabet start so
we<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> G<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.170> find<00:01:34.320> all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.890> white

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
we go up to G we can find all the white

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.810 
we go up to G we can find all the white
notes<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.920> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
notes so a be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
notes so a be
c<00:01:39.860> d<00:01:40.860> e<00:01:41.630> f<00:01:42.770> g<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.940> now<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.900> start<00:01:46.260> back<00:01:46.440> over<00:01:46.500> at

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
c d e f g and now we start back over at

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
c d e f g and now we start back over at
a<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> take<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> look<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> second<00:01:49.050> we

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a so take a look at for a second we

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.320 
a so take a look at for a second we
started<00:01:49.560> down<00:01:49.830> here<00:01:49.860> at<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.210> got

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
started down here at this a and we got

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.840 
started down here at this a and we got
the<00:01:51.479> g<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.660> we<00:01:51.780> started<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.410> i<00:01:52.440> pay

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
the g and we started back over i pay

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.280 
the g and we started back over i pay
you'll<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.840> look<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.050> similar

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you'll see that they look very similar

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.070 
you'll see that they look very similar
in<00:01:56.000> relative<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> groups<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.630> black<00:01:57.810> notes

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
in relative to the groups of black notes

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.300 
in relative to the groups of black notes
that<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.040> look<00:01:59.160> at<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that there and so if you look at this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.070 
that there and so if you look at this
group<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.670> three<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> note<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:00.930> one

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
group of three the a note is the one

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.719 
group of three the a note is the one
that<00:02:01.170> sort<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.440> nested<00:02:01.920> almost<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> right

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that sort of nested almost to the right

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
that sort of nested almost to the right
here<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.750> also<00:02:04.020> true<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
here and that's also true up here so you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.960 
here and that's also true up here so you
prove<00:02:05.250> three<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.930> notice<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.410> so<00:02:07.979> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
prove three and this a notice here so so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.720 
prove three and this a notice here so so
i<00:02:09.000> hope<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.570> makes<00:02:09.840> sense<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.459> all<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
i hope that makes sense to you all the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.940 
i hope that makes sense to you all the
labels<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.959> white<00:02:13.110> notes<00:02:13.320> are<00:02:13.470> something

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
labels for the white notes are something

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.690 
labels for the white notes are something
either<00:02:14.130> A<00:02:14.430> through<00:02:14.880> G<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:16.190> abcdefg<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.550> then

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
either A through G so abcdefg and then

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.699 
either A through G so abcdefg and then
you<00:02:17.760> start<00:02:18.030> over<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> think<00:02:19.530> about<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you start over if you think about the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.010 
you start over if you think about the
groups<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.130> three<00:02:20.459> black<00:02:20.850> notes<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.750> first

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
groups of three black notes the first

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.540 
groups of three black notes the first
note<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.380> right<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> left<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.310> is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
note that's right to the left of that is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.090 
note that's right to the left of that is
f<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.780> want<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:25.020> quick<00:02:25.410> way<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.620> quickly

all right now if you want to play any of
the<00:02:51.959> black<00:02:52.170> notes<00:02:52.380> all<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.130> have<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the black notes all you have to do is

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.880 
the black notes all you have to do is
name<00:02:53.850> them<00:02:54.090> relative<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.930> white<00:02:55.110> notes<00:02:55.350> so

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
name them relative to the white notes so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.259 
name them relative to the white notes so
we'll<00:02:56.160> take<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.310> look<00:02:56.459> at<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.820> note<00:02:57.209> right

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
we'll take a look at this note right

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.620 
we'll take a look at this note right
here<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:58.049> example<00:02:59.060> since<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:00.299> right<00:03:00.480> in

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
here for example since that's right in

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.199 
here for example since that's right in
between<00:03:00.780> an<00:03:01.079> F<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.560> G<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.519> know<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:02.970> call

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
between an F and G we know we can call

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.910 
between an F and G we know we can call
it<00:03:03.329> something<00:03:03.570> that's<00:03:03.930> either<00:03:04.170> related<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
it something that's either related to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.220 
it something that's either related to
the<00:03:05.010> F<00:03:05.160> or<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> G<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.049> call<00:03:07.170> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
the F or the G so if you want to call it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.539 
the F or the G so if you want to call it
an<00:03:07.410> f-sharp<00:03:07.650> an<00:03:08.840> f-sharp<00:03:09.840> means<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:11.070> an<00:03:11.250> it's

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
an f-sharp an f-sharp means it's an it's

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.250 
an f-sharp an f-sharp means it's an it's
a<00:03:11.700> little<00:03:12.000> bit<00:03:12.120> higher<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> little<00:03:12.840> bit<00:03:13.019> more<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
a little bit higher a little bit more to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.250 
a little bit higher a little bit more to
the<00:03:13.440> right<00:03:13.620> than<00:03:14.010> an<00:03:14.160> F<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the right than an F and so this is the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.490 
the right than an F and so this is the
closest<00:03:16.829> note<00:03:17.640> that's<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.630> right<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:19.110> f<00:03:19.320> so

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
closest note that's to the right of f so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.039 
closest note that's to the right of f so
it<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.680> call<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.100> an<00:03:20.220> f-sharp<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.930> can

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
it can call that an f-sharp now we can

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.910 
it can call that an f-sharp now we can
also<00:03:22.260> call<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.860> G<00:03:23.220> flat<00:03:23.700> or<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.769> note<00:03:25.769> that's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
also call it a G flat or the note that's

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920 
also call it a G flat or the note that's
a<00:03:26.010> little<00:03:26.190> bit<00:03:26.310> further<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.120> left<00:03:27.150> from<00:03:27.720> G

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
a little bit further to the left from G

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.810 
a little bit further to the left from G
it's<00:03:28.140> not<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.320> straight<00:03:28.709> up<00:03:28.739> g<00:03:29.100> it's<00:03:29.610> like<00:03:29.790> a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
it's not a straight up g it's like a

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.310 
it's not a straight up g it's like a
little<00:03:30.060> bit<00:03:30.150> less<00:03:30.360> than<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.630> G<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.079> that's<00:03:31.230> what

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
little bit less than a G so that's what

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.530 
little bit less than a G so that's what
the<00:03:31.410> flat<00:03:31.680> means

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the flat means

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.059 
the flat means
a little<00:03:32.930> bit<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.319> left<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.769> little<00:03:33.920> bit

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
a little bit to the left a little bit

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.300 
a little bit to the left a little bit
deeper<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.019> can<00:03:36.170> call<00:03:36.349> this<00:03:36.469> a<00:03:36.530> g-flat<00:03:36.980> or

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
deeper so you can call this a g-flat or

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.030 
deeper so you can call this a g-flat or
an<00:03:37.670> f-sharp<00:03:38.109> so<00:03:39.109> here's<00:03:39.349> a<00:03:39.409> little<00:03:39.620> quiz<00:03:39.799> I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
an f-sharp so here's a little quiz I

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.410 
an f-sharp so here's a little quiz I
guess<00:03:40.219> what<00:03:40.519> might<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.819> be<00:03:40.969> able<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.209> call

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
guess what might you be able to call

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.860 
guess what might you be able to call
this<00:03:41.750> note<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.159> a<00:03:43.189> D<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.359> an<00:03:44.510> e

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
this note this is a D and this is an e

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.720 
this note this is a D and this is an e
so<00:03:45.379> think<00:03:45.620> about<00:03:45.709> it<00:03:45.890> for<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.040> few<00:03:46.069> seconds<00:03:46.519> what

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
so think about it for a few seconds what

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.500 
so think about it for a few seconds what
could<00:03:47.030> we<00:03:47.090> call<00:03:47.299> this<00:03:47.569> note<00:03:49.329> all<00:03:50.329> right<00:03:50.450> I'm

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
could we call this note all right I'm

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.569 
could we call this note all right I'm
just<00:03:50.629> going<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.780> say<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.049> answer<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.579> you

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
just going to say the answer is you

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.759 
just going to say the answer is you
could<00:03:52.700> call<00:03:52.939> it<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.120> d<00:03:53.329> sharp<00:03:53.659> or<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.049> little<00:03:54.680> bit

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
could call it a d sharp or a little bit

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.470 
could call it a d sharp or a little bit
to<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.010> right<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.569> D<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:59.150> could<00:03:59.269> call<00:03:59.420> it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
to the right of D or you could call it

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.190 
to the right of D or you could call it
an<00:03:59.689> E<00:04:00.139> flat<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.799> little<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.340> left<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.700> e

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
an E flat a little bit to the left of e

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.690 
an E flat a little bit to the left of e
okay<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:03.260> that's<00:04:03.560> pretty<00:04:04.040> much<00:04:04.129> how<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.489> can

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
okay so that's pretty much how you can

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.069 
okay so that's pretty much how you can
figure<00:04:05.030> out<00:04:05.090> all<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.450> names<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.930> notes

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
figure out all the names of the notes

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:14.530 
figure out all the names of the notes
here<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:06.349> we've<00:04:06.859> got<00:04:07.099> c<00:04:07.609> d<00:04:08.389> e<00:04:08.780> f<00:04:09.500> g<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:11.090> b<00:04:11.900> c<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.669> if

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
names of the notes you can do that in

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.180 
names of the notes you can do that in

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
exact same way so hopefully now when I'm

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040 
exact same way so hopefully now when I'm
referring<00:04:37.639> to<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.970> notes<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.750> know<00:04:38.780> what<00:04:38.900> I'm

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
referring to the notes you know what I'm
