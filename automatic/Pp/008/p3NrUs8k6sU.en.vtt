00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 extraordinary are tiny the same 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.860
 like to make it a little bit whole and that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.300
 the salad that's fabulous in it like that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.380
 like to drink it with beer this lizard 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.240
 in small development 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.070
 barbarian for this salad what 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.320
 ingredients is going to have this good 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.440
 In addition to the tentacles we are going to add 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 a little palmettos a month also something 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.420
 of olives choose this cabbage that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.130
 knows how to cook or box today is also 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.810
 a kind of rest that is achieved 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.700
 any bulería today is already available 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.100
 practically everywhere is a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 rest is a memory that you think 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.470
 also accuses and cooks or did four 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.660
 names decide if you have several names 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 as true in all the grocery stores what 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.700
 they will know for sure and if they can not use 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.590
 directly a lettuce or they can 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 use a cabbage I also hope 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 We can replace it can be replaced 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.660
 but in any case this can be 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.820
 getting practically is in all 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.970
 the greengrocers a little onions 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.070
 purple some tomatitos service and something 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 of lemon because we use today onion 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.759
 abode and tomatitos elvis because it's a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.860
 salad for clear acidity then 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.590
 we want to give you a special color 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.780
 we want to give a different flavor that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.369
 be very special to make it look 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.170
 and it looks very good our 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.759
 salads but if they do not get these 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.370
 ingredients can replace by 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.050
 common tomatoes or onions 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.020
 traditional how well the tentacles are 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.870
 they sell frozen products that are usually sold 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 usually frozen is more what 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.340
 ideal is that we buy them frozen 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.650
 work that we might want 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 sell dad as thawed but in 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
 that case they always come frozen from 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.190
 tentacles to cordoba arrive frozen and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.800
 they sell them soulless as it has 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 lost the chain of elements and can 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.970
 not being at your best moments of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.980
 freshness they prefer when 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.720
 are all frozen to cook 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.610
 aex first you have to defrost what 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.590
 our is not necessary we can put it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.630
 frozen to cook is not going to help a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.120
 little more time the cooking process 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.709
 but we can do all manes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.930
 you know 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.060
 good what is the price of these because 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.360
 there people get scared with the theme 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.350
 of the tentacles but the tentacles 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.750
 probably the cheapest thing in the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.090
 recipe lizard palmettos and are a 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.459
 little expensive maybe 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.900
 / is a little bit higher but good 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.849
 let's see is a recipe for 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.980
 parties tentacle salad 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.940
 squid for 72 pesos we can prepare 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.310
 four portions we are eating things 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.989
 fine of course it's a salad for 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.200
 the pieces like to cook an idea 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.180
 different from the one who submits to eating at 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.930
 house of that low island for example goes to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.069
 eat at home 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.739
 Diskin then lizards the room 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.739
 tentacle salad 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:14.390
 and a little bit of fancy if we take for 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.390
 here waiting
