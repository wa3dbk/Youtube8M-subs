00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.320
 what more topics than more 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 I bought this illuminator 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.710
 means that I did not want to buy it because 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.870
 it seemed a bit expensive and that but what 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.090
 I saw there and I said I have to bring it 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.410
 with me because it's so beautiful you see 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.500
 there I do not have even with the plastic 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.200
 still put 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.160
 is beautiful 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.450
 I'm going to remove the plastic yes it is 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.470
 Pretty striking is pretty golden 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 there you see it but good now for the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.910
 summer that I have is not a little more 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.480
 brunette and that's how it is there I do not know if you see it 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.540
 It gives a lot of sun and also came with a 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.870
 bed and I thought we're going great and not 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.330
 I remember the exact price but I think 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.209
 remember that it cost me about 40 a little 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.150
 less than 40 euros like the blusher 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.269
 the rouge also cost me I do not take 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.019
 40 euros a blush of this outside 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:56.780
 that comes with its case also and this is 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.780
 the 676 coral cruise 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.510
 I will remove it because it is that if there is not 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.510
 come 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.350
 It is a lovely color among pink 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.920
 a coral color between roses and with a 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.920
 dot d 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.080
 west very beautiful orange 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.300
 is that the hand is going to look so subtle 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.640
 that I do not know if he's going to be able to see me because 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.340
 a stream of light enters through the window 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.820
 that I do not see things well in the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.340
 camera 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.780
 there you see it 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.769
 super super super nice beautiful that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.209
 more I bought a lipstick from the rucks 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.209
 volume of aisa laurent 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.930
 I think it did not reach 20 euros or a 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.260
 little thing like about twenty euros and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.019
 this was the tone 15 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.670
 and when the switches I saw it so nice 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:07.189
 so creamy a color we're going great 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.189
 what I like is this one here 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:13.010
 it's a red but with some autonomas 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.230
 lovely orange 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.910
 and I think it's the third lipstick of these 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.250
 since I have so I do not have either 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.460
 many so I gave myself the whim 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.430
 and I bought the mascara 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.969
 new coat of God the viola of the 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.479
 this 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.449
 which it is so but this I can not speak 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.369
 I have not started anything 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.269
 from here to a time when I run out 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:41.689
 some of the ones that I'm using 

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:45.439
 currently and I think I remember that it cost me 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.060
 20 euros 21 euros a little thing I know very well 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.150
 reflection 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.919
 and finally the last two things 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.889
 I bought two enamels 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.650
 inside I bought the 551 that is the 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:07.840
 adventure that this is the one that took the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.840
 since it is a totally coral color 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.300
 it is a color as well as very orange 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.150
 pretty and the other one is the wonderland at 575 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.760
 what is this here 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.860
 we say that I do these things except 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.660
 of the lipstick that the yori makes this 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.400
 is the one that came out for Christmas that you 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.800
 I said that you buy it from duty free in 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.320
 the airport the rest of things I have 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.620
 bought at a store that I think is 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.890
 they call it's called the perfume store 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.240
 paris or something like that and it's in the south of 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.180
 great canary is that is where I've gone 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.070
 Vacation in the harbor area 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.290
 rich there is like a shopping center where 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.740
 There are quite a few shops and there are stores that 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.940
 They have like special prices 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.730
 respect to the peninsula that have both 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.700
 percent discount so it drifts and 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.470
 all that then if there were some of 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.300
 the products that had a 30 others a 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.250
 35 but well I told you prices 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.650
 approximate so you can see the difference 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.090
 more than anything I wanted to show you these 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.070
 little things because maybe if someone 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.260
 travel or whatever this vacation is worth 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.830
 It's really worth going to these places like this 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.830
 because maybe 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.670
 for a little more price for example 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.260
 the mascara that costs 20 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.270
 euros if you're going to buy one of 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.970
 one of drugstore and it costs you 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.530
 some 12 13 14 euros because it was a 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.960
 little bit more you have a previous one is that 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.000
 there are things that come out very well of price and 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.100
 these are the whims that I bought 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.990
 this vacation so nothing that I hope 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.730
 that you liked the video 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.550

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.350
 videos with tutorials reviews and ya 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.540
 I'll talk more about these products it was just 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.850
 to show you my purchases of these 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.900
