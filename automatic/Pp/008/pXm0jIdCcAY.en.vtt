00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.310
 there 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 that stinks 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.990
 Help got what he wanted 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.469
 Recently a developer wrote to me if I did not use his app 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.480
 Heigl does not want to test anything 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.650
 and of course I immediately pledged that I clearly want the JU Yun 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.029
 whereupon he has sent 1 4 per course and one of you uses the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.690
 The other three you can succeed in the connection to it's a little question 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.560
 But first look at the app now 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 if these states we see immediately in the menu we have the choice between 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 he does animation and he takes the pictures 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.200
 Animation are simple picture effects lines, maybe the first one 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.160
 and then 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.160
 Different is guessing is simulated by blue light 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.540
 with a double click we come out of there 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.340
 and then here you want to take the two days monkey cowards 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 find the whole animation 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.250
 looking then we have Animation 4 here is a special location namely 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 please follow it so it is also on it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.440
 and now we can choose that and we can do it all normally 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.479
 or mirrored mirrored you need of course 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.479
 because you are in a mirror 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 we still leave that to normal 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 that's what this animation looks like 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 so even this mirrored it thought that i'm pretty good then 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.670
 Besides these seven animations, we also recorded PD 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.340
 and some shots 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 you are 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 as the name says shots of blue lights 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.280
 for example, like the first 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 there is the double and also these are of course again with two place 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.380
 Yamauchi just a real blue light 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 exactly 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.380
 And if we were due for it would be because Ford reading 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.430
 we do not have it that way too okay 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.099
 As I said you can now turn three-point belt to this Apple 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.389
 and what she has to do is it too 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.939
 then this just has me I take care of me the question arises as 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:16.839
 I use this app 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.919
 the team but what should I do with that for you very well 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.529
 and I never really got a result 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.749
 Therefore, then found what this app is for sale 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.019
 good and the first three close to a good answer to that 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.929
 can give what you can with Desert start 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.819
 m the common code 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.139
 and 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.629
 it should have been then I hope the Union is again thank you very much 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.599
 to the developer that he has provided with every fifth 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.759
 and 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.960
 as a conclusion, own work remains solid 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.159
 ordinary he 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.949
 only the south is beyond me 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.839
 So it's good and the end is coming soon
