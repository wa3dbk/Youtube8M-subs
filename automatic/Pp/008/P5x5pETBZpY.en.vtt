00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
seems like helpless situations how do

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.810 
seems like helpless situations how do
you<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.539> adapting<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> game

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you go about adapting that into a game

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.429 
you go about adapting that into a game
and<00:00:24.029> sort<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> give<00:00:24.359> us<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> brief<00:00:24.779> rundown<00:00:25.080> of

and sort of give us the brief rundown of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.560 
and sort of give us the brief rundown of
it<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> actually<00:00:26.420> deconstruct<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it well if you actually deconstruct the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.910 
it well if you actually deconstruct the
all<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> movies<00:00:28.199> will<00:00:28.380> find<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> they're

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
all the movies will find that they're

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.150 
all the movies will find that they're
actually<00:00:29.810> about<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.840> series<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> choices<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
actually about a series of choices and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.979 
actually about a series of choices and
my<00:00:32.700> favorite<00:00:33.059> game<00:00:33.210> designer<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:33.719> time

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
my favorite game designer of all time

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.020 
my favorite game designer of all time
has<00:00:34.290> said<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> game<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.579> series<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
has said that a game is a series of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
has said that a game is a series of
interesting<00:00:36.329> choices<00:00:36.719> played<00:00:37.440> over<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.800> over

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
interesting choices played over and over

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.979 
interesting choices played over and over
again<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> figured<00:00:39.480> once<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> have

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
again and so I figured once you have

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.750 
again and so I figured once you have
that<00:00:40.110> element<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.710> fairly<00:00:40.950> easy<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.460> go<00:00:41.550> back

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that element it's fairly easy to go back

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
that element it's fairly easy to go back
and<00:00:42.000> make<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.840> what<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.020> did<00:00:43.140> though<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and make it and so what we did though is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
and make it and so what we did though is
is<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.460> necessarily<00:00:45.030> helpless<00:00:45.390> at

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
is you're not necessarily helpless at

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.119 
is you're not necessarily helpless at
any<00:00:45.690> point<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.140> always<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
any point there's always a way out and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.950 
any point there's always a way out and
if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> go<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.149> carefully<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
if you go back and look carefully at a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
if you go back and look carefully at a
lot<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> traps<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> jigsaw<00:00:50.730> world

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
lot of the traps in the jigsaw world

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
lot of the traps in the jigsaw world
you're<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.780> actually<00:00:52.020> trap<00:00:52.559> per<00:00:52.739> se<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> lot<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you're not actually trap per se a lot of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
you're not actually trap per se a lot of
times<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.789> both<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> hard<00:00:54.270> way<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:55.110> very

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
times it's both the hard way out or very

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.020 
times it's both the hard way out or very
easy<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.489> you're<00:00:56.610> paying<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.940> little

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
easy way out if you're paying a little

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
easy way out if you're paying a little
bit<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.420> attention<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.440> actually

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
bit more attention so we actually

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
bit more attention so we actually
incorporated<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.399> into<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> gameplay<00:01:00.000> some

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
incorporated that into the gameplay some

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
incorporated that into the gameplay some
of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.899> traps<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> pay<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of the traps if you pay a little bit of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
of the traps if you pay a little bit of
attention<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.879> quite<00:01:03.090> easy<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.390> get

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
attention are really quite easy to get

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
attention are really quite easy to get
out<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> others<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.799> didn't<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.460> very

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
out of and others if you didn't or very

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280 
out of and others if you didn't or very
hard<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.960> let's<00:01:07.110> talk<00:01:07.229> about

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
hard to get out of so let's talk about

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
hard to get out of so let's talk about
the<00:01:07.560> demo<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> guys<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.340> showing<00:01:08.670> here

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the demo that you guys are showing here

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
the demo that you guys are showing here
it<00:01:08.970> starts<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> reverse<00:01:10.080> bear

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it starts out with that reverse bear

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
it starts out with that reverse bear
travel<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.520> big<00:01:11.760> metal<00:01:12.450> binding<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.080> your

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
travel that big metal binding on your

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
travel that big metal binding on your
face<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.310> obviously<00:01:14.970> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
face there which is very obviously like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
face there which is very obviously like
deliberate<00:01:16.020> puzzle<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.100> you've<00:01:17.250> got

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
deliberate puzzle but then you've got

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.800 
deliberate puzzle but then you've got
some<00:01:17.610> subtle<00:01:18.000> elements<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.689> more

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
some subtle elements to some more

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.030 
some subtle elements to some more
adventure<00:01:19.259> type<00:01:19.470> things<00:01:19.710> where<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
adventure type things where you go

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440 
adventure type things where you go
around<00:01:20.070> looking<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.759> clues<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> tell<00:01:21.420> us

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
around looking for clues can you tell us

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.300 
around looking for clues can you tell us
about<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.930> demo<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.439> showing<00:01:22.680> with<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
about this demo you're showing with the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100 
about this demo you're showing with the
demo<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.180> wanted<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.689> wanted<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.080> sure

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
demo we wanted to we wanted to make sure

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.200 
demo we wanted to we wanted to make sure
we<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.830> key<00:01:26.009> elements<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> saw<00:01:26.729> into<00:01:27.119> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we got the key elements of saw into it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.580 
we got the key elements of saw into it
