00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that the searching is carried out when

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
that the searching is carried out when
people<00:00:59.670> do<00:01:00.210> commune<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:00.989> half<00:01:01.230> me

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
people do commune so it's really half me

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
people do commune so it's really half me
to<00:01:01.559> explain<00:01:01.829> how<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.609> quite

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to explain how that's going but quite

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
to explain how that's going but quite
frankly<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.210> shouldn't<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.539> happened<00:01:03.570> if

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
frankly that shouldn't have happened if

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.450 
frankly that shouldn't have happened if
there<00:01:04.559> were<00:01:04.619> less<00:01:04.739> than<00:01:04.769> any<00:01:05.010> lessons<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> be

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
there were less than any lessons to be

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
there were less than any lessons to be
learnt<00:01:05.670> from<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> well<00:01:06.780> i<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> lesson

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
learnt from this well i think the lesson

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
learnt from this well i think the lesson
that<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.010> should<00:01:08.159> should<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.670> pride<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that we should should take pride in is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
that we should should take pride in is
that<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> footage<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that when you see that the footage you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
that when you see that the footage you
will<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.430> police<00:01:12.030> officers<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.540> the
