line really going on up to 6000 milli
amps<00:00:18.670> of<00:00:18.820> power<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:20.410> these<00:00:20.530> are<00:00:20.650> actually

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
amps of power but these are actually

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.480 
amps of power but these are actually

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
work device and it charged each of the

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.309

smartphones to the fullest and then with

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.559 
smartphones to the fullest and then with
a<00:00:41.350> little<00:00:41.440> bit<00:00:41.679> of<00:00:41.739> battery<00:00:42.100> left<00:00:42.760> over<00:00:43.089> but<00:00:43.329> I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
a little bit of battery left over but I

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.209 
a little bit of battery left over but I
would<00:00:43.780> say<00:00:43.929> it's<00:00:44.079> not<00:00:44.649> wasn't<00:00:45.010> quite<00:00:45.129> enough

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
would say it's not wasn't quite enough

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.759 
would say it's not wasn't quite enough
to<00:00:45.460> charge<00:00:45.609> two<00:00:45.999> devices<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:47.289> I<00:00:47.469> mean<00:00:47.649> you

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
to charge two devices what I mean you

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.009 
to charge two devices what I mean you
really<00:00:47.949> can<00:00:48.219> plug<00:00:48.460> in<00:00:48.609> 3<00:00:48.850> devices<00:00:49.179> at<00:00:49.539> a<00:00:49.600> time

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
really can plug in 3 devices at a time

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.860 
really can plug in 3 devices at a time
but<00:00:50.979> to<00:00:51.339> fully<00:00:51.850> charge<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.389> I<00:00:52.569> would<00:00:52.719> say

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
but to fully charge one I would say

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.279 
but to fully charge one I would say
you're<00:00:53.319> getting<00:00:53.559> one<00:00:53.829> full<00:00:54.129> charge<00:00:54.729> from<00:00:55.030> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you're getting one full charge from it

our warranty and manual and then the
charger<00:01:06.310> itself<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.120> much<00:01:07.660> more<00:01:07.900> sleek<00:01:08.170> with

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
charger itself so much more sleek with

they added them some fun colors to it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.480 
they added them some fun colors to it
but<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.170> older<00:01:14.470> models<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:15.100> actually

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
but like the older models it actually

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.180 
but like the older models it actually
has<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.730> cords<00:01:16.620> included<00:01:17.620> yeah<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.040> they're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
has the cords included yeah so they're

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.210 
has the cords included yeah so they're
actually<00:01:18.460> attached<00:01:19.440> comparing<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.710> older

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
actually attached comparing to the older

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.040 
actually attached comparing to the older
models<00:01:21.580> there<00:01:21.790> was<00:01:21.820> actually<00:01:22.180> like<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.300> plastic

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
models there was actually like a plastic

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.170 
models there was actually like a plastic
coating<00:01:23.620> all<00:01:23.890> similar<00:01:24.310> plastic<00:01:24.700> coating<00:01:25.030> but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
coating all similar plastic coating but

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.550 
coating all similar plastic coating but
the<00:01:25.300> way<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.480> would<00:01:25.750> take<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.080> out<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.440> would

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
the way you would take it out it would

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.800 
the way you would take it out it would
twist<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.580> feel<00:01:27.790> like<00:01:27.910> there<00:01:28.240> was<00:01:28.270> wear<00:01:28.630> and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
twist so I feel like there was wear and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.080 
twist so I feel like there was wear and
tear<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.380> old<00:01:29.560> model<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.070> this<00:01:30.190> is<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.790> the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
tear on the old model and this is to the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.850 
tear on the old model and this is to the
charger<00:01:31.540> itself<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.320> think<00:01:32.440> they're<00:01:32.680> going

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
charger itself so I think they're going

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.610 
charger itself so I think they're going
to<00:01:32.950> last<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.820> lot<00:01:33.940> longer<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:35.110> we<00:01:35.200> go<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:35.530> we

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
to last a lot longer here we go so we

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.280 
to last a lot longer here we go so we
have<00:01:35.770> our<00:01:35.850> USB<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.930> could<00:01:38.140> actually

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
have our USB so you could actually

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.010 
have our USB so you could actually
either<00:01:38.590> use<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.400> charge<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.600> charger

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
either use this to charge the charger

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.330 
either use this to charge the charger
like<00:01:41.320> plug<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.620> into<00:01:41.740> your<00:01:41.860> computer<00:01:41.980> and

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
like plug it into your computer and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.270 
like plug it into your computer and
charges<00:01:42.909> i<00:01:43.000> have<00:01:43.150> two<00:01:43.360> feet<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.800> we<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.100> the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280

iphone<00:01:46.270> ipod<00:01:47.080> charger<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.890> if<00:01:48.370> you<00:01:48.490> take<00:01:48.700> a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730

iphone ipod charger and if you take a
look<00:01:49.000> right<00:01:49.210> underneath<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:50.710> these

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
look right underneath you see these

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.790 
look right underneath you see these
little<00:01:51.040> pins<00:01:51.960> I'll<00:01:52.960> show<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.290> what<00:01:53.440> those<00:01:53.620> are

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
little pins I'll show you what those are

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.870 
little pins I'll show you what those are
for<00:01:53.830> we<00:01:54.250> actually<00:01:54.580> have<00:01:54.730> a<00:01:54.880> voice<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.510> volume
