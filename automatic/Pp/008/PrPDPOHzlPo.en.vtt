00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.020
 well let's go over a little bit all 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.980
 the images that have been presented 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.710
 of final fantasy 13 lightning returns and 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.050
 you know third part of final fantasy 13 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.900
 I know that many of you do not 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.310
 like this final fantasy 13 is not worth 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.529
 they like they have not even done the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.289
 characters in general but good as 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.029
 You see this new title as you see these 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.580
 new images are images 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.830
 distributed by square enix so 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.870
 official in this third and final part 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.269
 is going to tell us the end of this 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.000
 trilogy that stars the character 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.190
 lightning a character that I repeat to 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.049
 many do not know why it ends us 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.330
 convincing but certainly what 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.890
 we have to highlight is that jump to the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.110
 Real- time action that will have 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.059
 this new title in some of these 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.280
 images we can see for example those 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.949
 dunes of death that were presented 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.629
 as one of the last scenarios 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.699
 new scenarios that we are going to 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.379
 find good it should be noted that the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.619
 time is going to be a very important factor 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.840
 in this new final fantasy 13 lightning 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.240
 returns 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.909
 and in addition you also have to say eye 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.939
 launch is planned for this 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.770
 same year on xbox 360 and playstation3 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.200
 although there is still no date 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.819
 determined but let's comment some 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.649
 that another detail as it has been 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.619
 talked for example that he will not have 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.079
 several endings as they had others of their 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.539
 titles the concept behind the design of 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.539
 lightning ricans is that it be the chapter 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.399
 concludes the saga the lightning to 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.069
 difference of the previous titles does not 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.470
 there will be multiple possible endings instead 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.380
 of that the story will lead to the only 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.020
 and true final these are words of the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.539
 director of the game vale de motomu 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.270
 Toriyama must also be said 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.759
 what good toriyama also said that 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.189
 when they talk about the visual side of 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.750
 the battles are worth if we think of the 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.909
 traditional role-playing games in 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.829
 battle systems by command then 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.020
 we have to wait for our 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.299
 enemy attack us something that says it is 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.340
 unrealistic and that nothing is the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.379
 future of role playing he says that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.329
 the future of role playing is the 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.260
 real- time action something that is going to 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.569
 to show 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.730
 new third installment of final fantasy 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.189
 13 to about we'll see how everything works 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.290
 this and we will wait for the title for this 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:27.329
 year and we will be very attentive to possible 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.329
 possible dates ads 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.190
 yes
