effective the shielding that he has on

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.120 
effective the shielding that he has on
it<00:01:55.000> will<00:01:55.540> just<00:01:55.719> deflect<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.619> blade<00:01:56.829> swipes

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130

it will just deflect the blade swipes
that<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> have<00:01:57.610> gives<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.360> an<00:01:58.450> opportunity

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
that you have gives you an opportunity

that you have gives you an opportunity
needed<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.350> switch<00:01:59.530> over<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.159> tendrils

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
needed to switch over to the tendrils

power<00:02:00.670> which<00:02:01.240> with<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.540> slightly<00:02:01.869> longer<00:02:02.200> range

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.319 
power which with a slightly longer range
and<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.430> fact<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.850> can<00:02:04.000> jump<00:02:04.180> away

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
and the fact that you can jump away

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.060 
and the fact that you can jump away
because<00:02:04.990> he'll<00:02:05.259> there<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> chance<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.829> attack

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
because he'll there a chance to attack

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.039 
because he'll there a chance to attack
it<00:02:06.250> with<00:02:06.340> relative<00:02:06.520> safety<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.299> lot<00:02:07.899> of<00:02:07.930> people

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
it with relative safety a lot of people

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.259 
it with relative safety a lot of people
myself<00:02:08.590> included<00:02:08.890> had<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> lot<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.789> fun<00:02:10.060> with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
myself included had a lot of fun with

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.870 
myself included had a lot of fun with
the<00:02:10.390> skies<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:11.370> changed<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.459> place<00:02:12.700> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the skies it changed the place the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.699 
the skies it changed the place the
gameplay<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.329> that<00:02:13.630> slowed<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.049> down<00:02:14.079> allowed

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
gameplay so that slowed it down allowed

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.580 
gameplay so that slowed it down allowed
you<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
you to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.770 
you to
kind<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.920> play<00:02:16.370> at<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.610> slower<00:02:16.879> pace<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.720> me

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
kind of play at a slower pace and for me

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.300 
kind of play at a slower pace and for me
that<00:02:17.810> was<00:02:17.959> really<00:02:18.530> valuable<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:19.069> that's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that was really valuable because that's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.920 
that was really valuable because that's
how<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.790> play<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.510> think<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.750> lot<00:02:20.780> of

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
how I like to play and I think a lot of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.479 
how I like to play and I think a lot of
players<00:02:21.170> enjoyed<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:21.950> well<00:02:22.129> so<00:02:22.310> we've

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
players enjoyed that as well so we've

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.089 
players enjoyed that as well so we've
brought<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.940> over<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:24.019> prototype<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.440> what

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
brought that over to prototype to what

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.410 
brought that over to prototype to what
we<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.459> prototype<00:02:25.700> 2<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.150> something

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
we have in prototype 2 is something

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.089 
we have in prototype 2 is something
called<00:02:26.510> black<00:02:26.780> man<00:02:26.989> black<00:02:27.410> net<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.830> the

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
called black man black net is the

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.040 
called black man black net is the
secured<00:02:28.580> encrypted<00:02:28.970> network<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.629> are<00:02:29.810> used

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
secured encrypted network that are used

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.440 
secured encrypted network that are used
by<00:02:30.260> Black<00:02:30.470> Watch<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.010> gentech<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:32.120> run<00:02:32.299> their

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
by Black Watch and gentech to run their

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.809
