the<00:01:08.040> alterna<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:12.510> time<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.740> receiver

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the alterna now time for the receiver

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:29.260 
the alterna now time for the receiver
part<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:23.030> might<00:01:24.030> give<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.369> wires

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:02:08.889 

listen<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.979> part<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> goes<00:01:32.790> here<00:02:05.719> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.570 

then<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.080> put<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.530> other<00:02:10.739> part<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.400> will

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
then you put the other part that will

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.970 
then you put the other part that will
check<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.080

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
you get that this the receiver plug it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:38.309 
you get that this the receiver plug it
in<00:02:28.959> plug<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.400> should<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:34.580> this

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.410 

yeah<00:02:39.319> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.910> then<00:02:41.890> you're<00:02:42.890> gonna<00:02:43.069> have<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
yeah like that then you're gonna have a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.280 
yeah like that then you're gonna have a
problem<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:48.380> L<00:02:48.890> will<00:02:49.250> turn<00:02:49.489> off<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.290> for

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
problem if L will turn off with this for

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.180 
problem if L will turn off with this for
a<00:02:51.319> little<00:02:51.650> bit<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:53.920> with<00:02:54.920> your<00:02:55.130> other

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
a little bit and then with your other

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.309 
a little bit and then with your other
mouse<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.569> will<00:02:56.599> get<00:02:57.730> your<00:02:58.730> computer<00:03:02.319> there's
