00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 I greet such a new technology 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.700
 tutorial today is the topic in the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 there is also a whole lot again 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.970
 different variants one man 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.400
 can do cross lifting can wide 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.610
 It can grab it neutral 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.550
 vice versa like to show it easy 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.779
 times this neutral position object 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 is relatively close not long nationwide 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.769
 important for the complaints to be registered 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.580
 after finding below and trikes relatively 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 neutral bit further than 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.100
 shoulder widths so now are the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.000
 shivered 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 you're on the floor with your heel 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 the back is just that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.350
 shoulder blades are active in hesse 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 drawn 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.809
 the view is just the big one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.510
 boom of the building society and now go 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.660
 you go up that is next to planks 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 had the umpire and shoots 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.070
 with his hip came forward only then 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.060
 initiate the letter 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.700
 important is the left power out 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 The hips could not come off 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.250
 abroad from the poor for example the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.460
 means the air is the speed 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.909
 the factor in the whole thing so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.619
 again the clarks the buttocks together 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.979
 actively contract backwards 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:46.759
 Construction start high voltage 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:02:00.099
 everything is on sparklers right comes the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:02:06.759
 running so slowly would be like that 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:10.610
 So leg upper body hip again 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:14.110
 Shinbone upper body hip so im 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.720
 end effect the hip usually forward 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.200
 now there is the possibility that you are in 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.629
 change handle price ensures that for 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.299
 more stability right there should it 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.099
 also replace regulary! 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.640
 First of all right price however 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.640
 circle 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.050
 and in the next sentence then vice versa 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.580
 Muscles that are trained in the case 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.690
 are thigh reverse the buttocks and 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.459
 of course thinks this is after 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.580
 back muscles stabilizing that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.290
 with it is yes that 's still there 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.500
 say 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.500
 Practice practicing and stay tuned until then
