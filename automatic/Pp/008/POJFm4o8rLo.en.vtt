00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.920 
her arms are jointed at the wrist and
the<00:02:21.989> elbow<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.680> shoulder<00:02:23.720> they<00:02:24.720> didn't

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the elbow and the shoulder they didn't

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.910 
the elbow and the shoulder they didn't
really<00:02:25.049> do<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.409> with<00:02:25.470> her<00:02:25.739> hair<00:02:26.040> uh

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
really do much with her hair uh

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.080 
really do much with her hair uh
realistically<00:02:28.920> though<00:02:29.099> her<00:02:29.580> hair<00:02:29.730> couldn't

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
realistically though her hair couldn't

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.900 
realistically though her hair couldn't
have<00:02:30.209> been<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.319> straight-on<00:02:32.220> ponytail

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
have been in a straight-on ponytail

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.119 
have been in a straight-on ponytail
because<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.810> would<00:02:34.049> be<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.769> front<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
because then it would be in front of a

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.740 
because then it would be in front of a
camera<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.910> tie<00:02:36.090> Barbie's<00:02:36.450> hair<00:02:36.599> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
camera and then you tie Barbie's hair in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.530 
camera and then you tie Barbie's hair in
front<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.019> all<00:02:37.110> your<00:02:37.230> pictures<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:39.150> guess<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
front of all your pictures so I guess I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.119 
front of all your pictures so I guess I
can<00:02:39.660> understand<00:02:40.110> why<00:02:40.319> they<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.560> tossed<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
can understand why they just tossed it

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.970 
can understand why they just tossed it
in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> side<00:02:41.640> ponytail<00:02:42.530> there<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.620> an<00:02:43.769> online

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
in the side ponytail there is an online

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.300 
in the side ponytail there is an online

the<00:02:53.370> internet<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.900> wasn't<00:02:55.410> very

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the internet it really wasn't very

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.819 
the internet it really wasn't very
interesting<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.569> online<00:02:57.959> portion<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.650> quite

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
interesting the online portion so quite

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.440 
interesting the online portion so quite
honestly<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:59.459> wasn't<00:02:59.879> really<00:03:00.120> worth<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.420> time

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
honestly it wasn't really worth the time

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.410 
honestly it wasn't really worth the time
and<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.200> download<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.060> extra

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and the download to get this extra

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.470 
and the download to get this extra
software<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.170> haven't<00:03:04.530> used<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.859> since<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:06.420> was

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
software I haven't used it since it was

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.110 
software I haven't used it since it was
just<00:03:06.810> kind<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.049> useless<00:03:07.489> as<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.849> see

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
just kind of useless as you can see

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.119 
just kind of useless as you can see
right<00:03:09.359> now<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.840> set<00:03:10.109> sis<00:03:10.379> just<00:03:10.410> scrolled

different<00:03:11.910> pictures<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.569> your<00:03:12.720> t-shirt<00:03:13.099> if<00:03:14.099> it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
different pictures on your t-shirt if it

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.130 
different pictures on your t-shirt if it
wasn't<00:03:14.730> set<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.629> was<00:03:15.720> just<00:03:15.930> one

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
wasn't set to this and it was just one

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.289 
wasn't set to this and it was just one
still<00:03:16.440> image<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:17.250> would<00:03:17.400> only<00:03:17.640> be<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:17.970> her

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
still image it would only be on her

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.839 
still image it would only be on her
shirt<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.870> maybe<00:03:19.019> three<00:03:19.769> five<00:03:20.160> minutes<00:03:20.609> at

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
shirt for maybe three five minutes at

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.180 
shirt for maybe three five minutes at
the<00:03:21.269> most<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:22.019> then<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.560> would<00:03:22.680> shut<00:03:22.829> off<00:03:23.010> on

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the most and then it would shut off on

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.780 
the most and then it would shut off on
its<00:03:23.370> own<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.889> still<00:03:26.160> images<00:03:26.579> if

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
its own I think for the still images if

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.069 
its own I think for the still images if
you<00:03:26.819> just<00:03:27.090> wanted<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.599> image<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
you just wanted that one image on the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.150 
you just wanted that one image on the
shirt<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.440> really<00:03:28.769> should<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.040> been<00:03:29.130> a

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
shirt it really should have been a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.879 
shirt it really should have been a
longer<00:03:29.609> wait<00:03:29.819> time<00:03:30.120> before<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.810> shut<00:03:31.019> off<00:03:31.049> so

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
longer wait time before it shut off so

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.370 
longer wait time before it shut off so
you<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.160> no<00:03:32.310> control<00:03:32.609> over<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.970> so

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
you have no control over it so

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you have no control over it so
unfortunately<00:03:34.380> your<00:03:34.500> dolls<00:03:34.680> t-shirt<00:03:35.250> is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
unfortunately your dolls t-shirt is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.789 
unfortunately your dolls t-shirt is
going<00:03:35.669> to<00:03:35.819> shut<00:03:36.000> off<00:03:36.209> in<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:37.139> know<00:03:37.260> three<00:03:37.709> to

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
going to shut off in you know three to

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.009 
going to shut off in you know three to
five<00:03:37.980> minutes<00:03:38.370> unless<00:03:38.849> you<00:03:39.090> do<00:03:39.359> this<00:03:39.480> girly

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
five minutes unless you do this girly

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.190 
five minutes unless you do this girly
thing<00:03:40.260> which<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:42.209> know<00:03:42.299> tends<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.810> keep<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.079> on

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
thing which you know tends to keep it on

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.559 
thing which you know tends to keep it on
longer<00:03:43.730> anyways<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.940> think<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.389> really

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
longer anyways I think this is really

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.150 
longer anyways I think this is really
cool<00:03:45.810> doll<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> think<00:03:46.380> any<00:03:46.560> girl<00:03:46.889> that

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
