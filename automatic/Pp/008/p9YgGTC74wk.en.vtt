00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
turn up you know ba I seriously think

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.479 
turn up you know ba I seriously think
that<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:37.130> toy<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.310> race

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that we are out of the the toy to race

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.310 
that we are out of the the toy to race
ba<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:42.360> know<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.660> makes<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.110> first

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
ba but you know it makes the first

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.790 
ba but you know it makes the first
second<00:02:43.739> or<00:02:43.860> third<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.790> even<00:02:45.660> worse<00:02:46.410> sports

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
second or third or even worse sports

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.490 
second or third or even worse sports
because<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.700> we<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.000> force<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.170> need<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
because if we are force then we need to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.290 
because if we are force then we need to
play<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.830> qualification<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> champions

play the qualification for the champions

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.360 
play the qualification for the champions
again<00:02:52.310> having<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.510> word<00:02:54.510> copy<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.989> 2014<00:02:55.920> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
again having a word copy in 2014 you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.729 
again having a word copy in 2014 you
know<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.640> players<00:02:56.820> not<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.390> have<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.739> lot

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
know the players not going to have a lot

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.380 
know the players not going to have a lot
of<00:02:58.769> break<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.940> start<00:03:00.180> early

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
of break and if you have to start early

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.690 
of break and if you have to start early
and<00:03:01.380> we're<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.800> suffer<00:03:02.100> next<00:03:02.340> season

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
and we're going to suffer next season

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.540 
and we're going to suffer next season
also<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:03.720> must<00:03:03.900> sign<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.320> striker<00:03:04.980> next<00:03:05.220> season

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
also we must sign a striker next season

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.199 
also we must sign a striker next season
because<00:03:05.900> otherwise<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.410> think<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.820> sell<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
because otherwise I think we can sell a

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.000 
because otherwise I think we can sell a
zero<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:09.989> point<00:03:10.290> having<00:03:10.560> him<00:03:10.860> if

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
zero because was the point having him if

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.039 
zero because was the point having him if
you<00:03:11.100> don't<00:03:11.310> have<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> quality<00:03:12.299> stronger<00:03:12.930> that

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
you don't have a quality stronger that

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.900 
you don't have a quality stronger that
he<00:03:13.140> can<00:03:13.350> give<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.739> pose<00:03:14.040> he<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.610> known<00:03:14.880> for

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
he can give the pose he is known for

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.720 
he can give the pose he is known for
because<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.230> lot<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.739> people<00:03:17.489> are<00:03:17.610> disappointed

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
because a lot of people are disappointed

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
because a lot of people are disappointed
we<00:03:18.450> Simba<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.049> think<00:03:19.350> partly<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.829> reason<00:03:19.980> is

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
we Simba I think partly the reason is

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.039 
we Simba I think partly the reason is
that<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.549> don't<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.360> type<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.780> players

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
that we don't have the type of players

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.750 
that we don't have the type of players
that<00:03:22.829> he<00:03:23.160> allows<00:03:24.060> him<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.390> shine
