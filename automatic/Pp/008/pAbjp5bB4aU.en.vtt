 it makes him play his books we get 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.310
 found here for a new video on 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.069
 Minecraft 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.410
 so we end up on minecraft a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.349
 little server two mini-games in the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 sky wars category 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 so I'll explain vaguely the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 principle and to start the part he 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 must jump in the water go it's gone 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 but who is so I took mikit 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.119
 beginners the goal is simple in fact we have 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.500
 everyone neither the party starts very quickly 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 so I 'm leaving very quickly we were shocked at 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.290
 an island with a chest on oh my 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.290
 god 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.920
 miquel all of this and the purpose makes these 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.760
 two not even need in the middle the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 goal in fact is to be the last 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.739
 so quickly surviving his fear of a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.140
 crouch table garden kraft tables 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.620
 is quickly stic to do this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.620
 a sword 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.300
 this beyond that project did not take that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.680
 so I wanted to ask her so here we go 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.820
 starts with random staff in 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 the chests I fell well 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.290
 if I lose I do not know what I am 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.710
 so here's that interviews about 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.710

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750

 sail to the middle lets go 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.820

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.860
