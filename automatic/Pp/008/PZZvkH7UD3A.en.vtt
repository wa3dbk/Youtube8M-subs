00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.520
 how is this experience of 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.430
 the whole family to be able to do 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.160
 a long trip is to live on boat jack 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.510
 That you're only five months old here. 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.560
 being cool is really being everything 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.600
 what is imagined 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.820
 The page actually told me I was 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.280
 I told you I found it here I think 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.410
 You're better than you thought because 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.129
 could be a box of surprise both 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.370
 a good adaptation a bad adaptation and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.500
 he ended up being submerged by what he imagined 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.820
 now take a long trip like this 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.620
 It was not day time, it's night time. 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.839
 folder planning is that you are 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.120
 thinking of doing this the system of 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.390
 organize the children's study of the bank 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 It's not like this because we planned 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.879
 for more or less one year two years 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.400
 on sites like the date in two years and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.799
 we started chasing after how 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 solve and we went in search of 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.140
 information such as the return in search of 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.180
 the issue of education to the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.680
 distance and you will be the time that the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.060
 we also organize that the worst is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.549
 you go out to travel 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.079
 The worse thing is, you drop everything that you 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.000
 was bound to these are more 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:29.259
 difficult or in the middle field having more 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:37.930
 legal and moral on the boat so one day 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:41.710
 for the other it 's different there goes 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 on the new shelf still sheiju and you 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.820
 What are you most lacking in? 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.500
 do in your daily life what you did 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.530
 happen to live in a normal house 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.830
 between I think you do now here in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.170
 chic neighborhood go out with friends 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.369
 week but always friends told the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.130
 school studying at a distance is more 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.410
 complicated is cooler than you are 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.110
 with doubt it is more complicated but it is good 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:17.800
 that you can do the things that you do 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 You may want to go the matter caxias and that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.870
 what has changed in your life and if 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.870
 this experience of living on the boat
