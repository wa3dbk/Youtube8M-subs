00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
tuning and mechanical damage it's

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.920 
tuning and mechanical damage it's
confirmed<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.210> next<00:01:30.450> game<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930

great<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:32.090> mechanical<00:01:33.090> damage<00:01:33.300> wasn't

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
great to see mechanical damage wasn't

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.880 
great to see mechanical damage wasn't
something<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.840> was<00:01:33.930> really<00:01:34.080> fond<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> after

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
playing corridors for playing a few of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.330 
playing corridors for playing a few of
the<00:01:36.360> games<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:37.140> mechanical<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.830> damaging

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the games with mechanical get damaging

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100 
the games with mechanical get damaging
it's<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.850> making<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.210> excited<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> see

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's really making me excited to see

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.260

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
with chemical damage I think I might

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.530 
with chemical damage I think I might
keep<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> feature<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.940> just<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
keep this feature off just because it's

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.910 
keep this feature off just because it's
a<00:01:45.570> lot<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.720> off-roading<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.470> game<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
a lot of off-roading in this game and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.320 
a lot of off-roading in this game and
you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> castrate<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
you know when you castrate when you

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.760 
you know when you castrate when you
going<00:01:48.570> straight<00:01:48.810> into<00:01:48.960> barriers<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> stuff

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going straight into barriers and stuff

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
going straight into barriers and stuff
you<00:01:49.920> know<00:01:50.040> you're<00:01:50.760> gonna<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> bit<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you know you're gonna get a bit of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.550 
you know you're gonna get a bit of
damage<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.020> safe<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> say<00:01:52.350> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
damage you know it's safe to say this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.600 
damage you know it's safe to say this
game<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> bit

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
game is a bit

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.640 
game is a bit
off-road<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:54.690> you're<00:01:54.870> not<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.350> want

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
off-road so you're not really gonna want

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.410 
off-road so you're not really gonna want
to<00:01:55.770> play<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.159> mechanical<00:01:56.880> damage<00:01:56.970> if<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to play with mechanical damage if you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
to play with mechanical damage if you
are<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.870> like<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> kind<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.860> play

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
are kind of like if you kind of play

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.230 
are kind of like if you kind of play
like<00:01:59.220> me<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.760> placed<00:01:59.940> on<00:02:00.090> like

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
like me and you have to placed on like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.440 
like me and you have to placed on like
me<00:02:00.740> however<00:02:01.740> tuning<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.340> something<00:02:02.610> um<00:02:02.820> again

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
me however tuning is something um again

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
me however tuning is something um again
I'm<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.720> really<00:02:03.960> into<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:04.740> it's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
I'm not really into it but it's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.320 
I'm not really into it but it's
definitely<00:02:04.979> something<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.580> would<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:06.150> into

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
definitely something I would get into

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.180 
definitely something I would get into
maybe<00:02:06.659> someone<00:02:07.049> made<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> tuning<00:02:07.680> guide<00:02:07.860> or

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
maybe someone made a tuning guide or

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.680 
maybe someone made a tuning guide or
maybe<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.390> kind<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
maybe you know if I just kind of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.270 
maybe you know if I just kind of
researched<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.679> camshafts

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
researched a bit more about camshafts

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.729 
researched a bit more about camshafts
and<00:02:11.400> whatnot<00:02:11.700> maybe<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.629> would<00:02:12.959> get<00:02:13.230> chewing

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
and whatnot maybe I would get chewing

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.320 
and whatnot maybe I would get chewing

great<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.200> see<00:02:19.439> that<00:02:19.650> tuning<00:02:20.310> isn't

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
great to see that tuning isn't

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.350

southern<00:02:32.409> Europe<00:02:32.769> gives<00:02:32.950> us<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.159> very

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
southern Europe gives us a very

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.030 
southern Europe gives us a very
different<00:02:33.970> look<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.510> different<00:02:35.230> feel<00:02:35.500> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
different look of a different feel it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.740 
different look of a different feel it
was<00:02:36.189> any<00:02:36.310> crash<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.939> feels<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.269> I've<00:02:37.420> spent<00:02:37.540> a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
was any crash it feels like I've spent a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.000 
was any crash it feels like I've spent a
lot<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.959> time<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.319> North<00:02:38.470> America<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
lot of time in North America and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.250 
lot of time in North America and
open-world<00:02:39.430> games<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.849> general<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.569> love<00:02:41.049> that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
we're now in southern Europe in a place

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.569 
we're now in southern Europe in a place
that's<00:02:43.180> maybe<00:02:43.450> less<00:02:44.260> well<00:02:44.620> traveled<00:02:45.189> in<00:02:45.310> video

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
that's maybe less well traveled in video

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.849 
that's maybe less well traveled in video
games<00:02:45.879> were<00:02:46.359> still<00:02:46.420> epically<00:02:47.349> beautiful

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.730 
time is really just giving more room to
express<00:04:36.090> himself<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.690> we<00:04:36.810> have<00:04:36.930> more<00:04:37.530> than

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
express himself so we have more than

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.590 
express himself so we have more than
double<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.670> radio<00:04:38.940> stations<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.510> we

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
double the the radio stations that we

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.400 
double the the radio stations that we
had<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:39.870> horizon

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
had in horizon

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.880 
had in horizon
more<00:04:40.830> than<00:04:41.010> double<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.780> musical<00:04:42.780> content<00:04:43.260> and

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
more than double the musical content and

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.890
