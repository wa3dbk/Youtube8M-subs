improving efficiency and quality problem
is<00:00:27.680> now<00:00:28.009> we<00:00:28.040> have<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.369> new<00:00:28.640> set<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:28.970> challenges

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
is now we have a new set of challenges

enterprises<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:36.199> horizon<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:36.830> it's<00:00:36.980> not

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
enterprises on the horizon so it's not

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.560 
enterprises on the horizon so it's not
enough<00:00:37.430> anymore<00:00:37.519> for<00:00:37.970> companies<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:38.360> be

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
help us with those problems in fact you

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.140 
help us with those problems in fact you
could<00:00:49.280> argue<00:00:49.339> that<00:00:49.610> most<00:00:49.909> organizations

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
could argue that most organizations

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.110 
could argue that most organizations
today<00:00:51.019> suffer<00:00:51.470> from<00:00:51.589> a<00:00:51.710> set<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.309> disabilities

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
today suffer from a set of disabilities

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.180 
today suffer from a set of disabilities
they're<00:00:53.269> simply<00:00:53.600> not<00:00:53.750> adaptable<00:00:54.620> enough<00:00:54.769> and

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
they're simply not adaptable enough and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.530 
they're simply not adaptable enough and
they're<00:00:55.280> not<00:00:55.370> creative<00:00:55.820> enough<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.269> they're

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
they're not creative enough and they're

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.090 
they're not creative enough and they're
not<00:00:56.659> actually<00:00:56.930> many<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.559> them<00:00:57.650> great<00:00:57.830> places

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
not actually many of them great places

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.950 
not actually many of them great places
to<00:00:58.250> work<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.970> that's<00:00:59.089> why<00:00:59.330> we<00:00:59.360> have<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.690> change

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
to work so that's why we have to change

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.450 
to work so that's why we have to change
that<00:01:00.199> hundred-year-old<00:01:00.680> management<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.369> we

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
that hundred-year-old management and we

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.250 
that hundred-year-old management and we
we<00:01:01.790> have<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.089> hack<00:01:02.299> it<00:01:02.449> which<00:01:02.570> means<00:01:02.750> taking

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
we have to hack it which means taking

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.930 
we have to hack it which means taking
one<00:01:03.589> piece<00:01:03.799> at<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:04.010> time<00:01:04.040> not<00:01:04.400> trying<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.760> blow

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
it all up not trying to start all over

again but running experiments just as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.090

you'd experiment with a website or a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
start to change I think it's going to be

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
companies to do this it can be done but

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.550 
companies to do this it can be done but
if<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.090> think<00:01:44.120> about<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.570> at<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.900> core<00:01:45.260> of<00:01:45.290> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
if you think about it at the core of it
