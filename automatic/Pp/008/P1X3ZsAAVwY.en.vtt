00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.680

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.969
 as we see the following is our leo shirts 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.340

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.799
 he was kept walking by the hook for beauty 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.860
 gone got to highlight but drove to 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.450
 unpacking oh, I forgot something 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 drove to unpacking hope I have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.659

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.259
 please, so how unexpected is that? 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.329
 I also like a beautiful base 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.750
 by the way others advise supersky too 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.460
 crawled heap moved what else to do 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.050
 anything 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.440
 if you are wondering what kind of writing 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.490
 comments however 2 then grandfather on 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.180
 the street lying around and of course from the village to 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.070
 trash can however 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.630
 drove unpacking unpacking 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.110
 unpacking unpacking 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.400
 by the way, I forgot to show you here 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.100
 shorter than 82 of the cards that is usually 30 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.710
 mutagenic maps of iridescent 10 ultra 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
 which is interrupted by stripes in each 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.270
 pack of two cards of 2 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.640
 specialists mutagen maps and ultra maps 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 but ultra map is very often for me 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 fall so maybe eye cards 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.310
 collection 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.220
 danger gave as I skillfully opened it 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.380
 Wow, I did not drive this card for a long time 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.680
 dreamed good. 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:08.270
 it and no it and no he has his baby hour 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.670
 This and there is no campaign there is a mutagen card 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:16.400
 Leonardo is finally 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 and here such here are very mutagenic 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.950
 here's a funny card I will say 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.260
 just one kind of repeats it 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.050
 here is this rafael if now i am not 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.510
 deceive eyesight so to speak here 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.180
 this then here I count how many I 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:40.430
 money ugrohal for the entire collection not counting 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.660
 wait for those i will compare first you here i am 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.590
 add one more 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.790
 so here I will add to the zone 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.150
 I am shorter than many things like me 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.310
 you see 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:01.630
 Mutagen we gave me what I need to go here 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.640
 listen no i have in this part nor 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.340
 one repeating one think for 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.510
 none 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.130
 Here from this article for this deck but there 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.440
 inside somewhere some repeating me 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.690
 just noticed by the way even wrote 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.830
 on the forums, what can in one package 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.900
 on a post not 6 give 7a 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.580
 here even 8 fell out but I already 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.439
 they came across such a pile 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.319
 decently 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:41.129
 next pack and be sure yet 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:44.639
 one loop next card is he 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:48.330

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.000
 I don't have this either . Erbe did n't either 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.050
 about this, too, no and in short we 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.690
 it turns out casey johns and up ground 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.490
 that is, as we see, we actually have 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:05.129
 I damn it is fucking I do not have either 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.759
 one repetition in two packs of these not 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:13.469
 got caught and it's good it's good it's 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:16.669
 that's good 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:20.069
 Ahead of a point every such hockey 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:24.000
 pretty there all have a little chest 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:26.490

 he is all forked yes he is all broken 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:35.099
 it has long been bought but here such I 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.310
 I 'll show you this one right now. 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:40.919
 a collection of cards such here 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.099
 Interestingly right now, everything must be absolutely 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.889
 whites as you see absolutely all new 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:49.650
 Now I have to look at it somehow 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.379
 search repeat see already in fish 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.460
 Faith need to of course distinguish Kaya will 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:58.560
 bad by the way until the price I'm rafael 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.789
 only indirectly indirectly 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:08.819
 see yes there dents is the only g 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:13.259
 further so here too tesla eat repeats 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:16.589
 oh and michelangelo I no longer have 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:19.580
 say what seemed to me some 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:22.440
 see this is my collection 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.960
 collection halves count how many times 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:32.909
 two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:36.100
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 to 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:41.740
 wear 3123 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.480
 read 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.040
 5051 all 2 all for cards and this is already 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.610
 the lesser of course half of the lecture but all 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.670
 Equally live live horse racing is good then 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.790
 I can exchange if you need to let 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.500
 if you live in the bottom but somewhere I tell you 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.840
 I must have these three cards 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.070
 if you certainly donâ€™t have them 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.010
 any new ones 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.470
 on any topics that I do not have but 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.530
 the most important thing is not shown that is here 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.620
 like michelangelo ultra rare perfect 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.110
 just dont know without any dents without 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.410
 any scuffing we give about the exchange 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.300
 because that's all I'll tell you because 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.090
 that they generally absolutely seem to me 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.130
 not even worn anything but right here 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.860
 a bit stronger no no cover 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.770
 enter there to learn a droplet of balls and 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.990
 some of his legs are hiding here 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.980
 on dents me too can be removed by us 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.830
 give not so straight horrible shorter and 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:44.260
 cards I have unnecessary request 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.560
 fifty two cards is also super and 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.910
 if 55 cards put together 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.760
 I get in some kind of packaging 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.630
 Got 7 that is how I saw already 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.330
 ugrohali 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.670
 by the way, each package costs 65 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.130
 rubles so thank you all for watching 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.180
 and while we are still waiting for new cards and 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.300
 etc. etc. 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.410
 that is, thanks to everyone for watching everyone 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.130
 until 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.130
 hall
