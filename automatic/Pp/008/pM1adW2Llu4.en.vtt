00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.870
 all right 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.940
 enemy 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.960
 very good everyone I am bright and finally 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730
 I bring you the continuation of the analysis 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.650
 of the songs I leave here a 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 link to the first video in which 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.310
 we analyze until we all fall down the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.930
 die rice song and I finally see myself 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.720
 able to analyze where are we point 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.820
 always running and I do not know if you have changel 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.500
 something that I could not do before because 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.480
 He had sufficient information about l 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.410
 of lagarta etcetera I hope you like it 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.410
 and there we go 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 The first thing is to see who sings 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.970
 we know that elena sigman plays 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 samantha maxis inside the leader she 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.720
 has two voices a soft one that is 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.730
 samantha and another serious that is the devil 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.850
 becoming increasingly powerful and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.129
 trying to control it clarke s nova 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 he interprets ritÃ³ fenya maxis after 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.460
 of the exchange of souls emuni the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.559
 explosion of the rockets has three 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.780
 voices in carrion uses a voice 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.000
 relaxed that is risto feng and another serious 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
 that is the devil and in wall fall down 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.399
 uses the same relaxed voice feng rite 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 and another soft voice maxis but now we have 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.140
 to see it and origin bring us songs 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 sung by maluca so the first thing 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.170
 what are we going to see is who is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.420
 interpreting maluca 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.460
 it's about a girl a girl who is 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.290
 outside of leider and this we know because 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.240
 there is no serious voice if you have given 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.310
 account in all the songs elena and 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.770
 clark have voiced serious for 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.390
 interpret the demon but not maluca and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.430
 that means that the girl she is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.229
 interpreting is not in the ether is not 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.420
 trying to be controlled by the devil 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.159
 so we have to look for girls out 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.360
 of the leader analyzing a few sentences 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.360
 we will come to a conclusion 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.830
 Thank you 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.830
 the mole 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.399
 9 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.050
 Hello 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.120
 that 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.160
 Maluca says exactly the same 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.800
 phrases that elena sigman said in her 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.110
 songs because maluca is samantha but 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.790
 out of the leader we already saw in many videos 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.920
 previous that who enters the speed and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.780
 suffers a division of souls a part 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.880
 is in the ether and the other in the heron 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 condemned to eternal punishment for what 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.700
 if elena plays samantha of the ether 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.620
 maluca plays samantha de a garza 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.360
 like in all the songs something we 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.980
 they are counting and samantha is telling us 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.720
 telling what is happening to 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.819
 her heron ana after the events of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.099
 munt in where are we coin there are very few 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.959
 phrases where are we going we are 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.060
 blinded by fear as we know to 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.870
 where are we going, I let myself be carried away by everything 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.239
 That 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.310
 I feel that I fall do not let me go we have already 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.349
 seen that all these phrases are said by 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.390
 samantha the heron samantha is in the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.160
 eder and in the heron the eder is the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.080
 dimension that communicates our world with 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.090
 the heron so when rite feng 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.130
 exchange souls is in that precise 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.690
 moment when samantha is trapped 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.610
 in the heron condemned to eternal punishment 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.410
 since he has lost the connection with 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.450
 our dimension can no longer return 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.670
 although I would like is at that moment 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.799
 after exchanging warehouse world 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.349
 when samantha de a garza sings that 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.440
 he is afraid he thinks they have died and says 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.930
 I get carried away by everything I know 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.110
 in the video with kevin sherwood lyrics 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.030
 he left a code that decrypted says 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.950
 Let yourself go and principle 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.870
 will turn in the end this is a 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.540
 reference origins and is another test more 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.060
 that maluca is the samantha of the heron 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.830
 Samantha knows her father in 1917 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.590
 he was in an excavation and he found the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.030
 crazy place a possible portal to her her 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.580
 only hope to get out of there 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.100
 when samantha gets carried away by everything 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.470
 what knows how to go to origins to ask for help 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.330
 origins is the beginning of everything but 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.310
 when samantha goes back to the past 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.860
 get carried away by everything you know and 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.620
 ask for help that beginning will become 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.300
 at the end of the story in always 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.550
 Running the Samantha de la Garza has already 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.770
 arrived in 1917 to the place of excavation 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.560
 speaks of a field full of pain 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.570
 misery violence fear and death but you 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.000
 hard to recognize these feelings will 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.650
 It is hard to see and hear things that happen in 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.450
 the outside world is losing 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.760
 skills because she is no longer in the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.680
 ether only in the heron is leaving 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.660
 carry what they know why that is in 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.490
 the excavation is also fleeing from 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.260
 something says that it flees as if something 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.760
 I was chasing the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.320
 to see this paragraph because it is very 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.800
 important to understand who is 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.800
 refer 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:18.229
 Samantha is fleeing from the darkness 

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:20.179
 of the demon in abracadabra of ascension 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.099
 the devil says I know you want me to 

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:24.709
 go but I just started and now 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.959
 Samantha de Garza says I want you 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:28.669
 go but I know you just started 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:30.679
 samantha does not want to continue controlling 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.899
 the zombies do not want the devil the 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:34.539
 use is fleeing from the darkness and 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.279
 that's why he wants to leave now a heron 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.469
 probably because the devil is already what 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.809
 powerful enough to go to 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.449
 heron and re-seize it by 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:47.479
 that the last phrase to convert me has been 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.639
 imposed on me and that is that I think that's 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.799
 what happens more or less because although 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.539
 that blanket is not in the eder the zombies 

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:55.369
 they have yellow eyes as if it were the 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.229
 samantha of the heron that because of that 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:59.599
 darkness from which he flees to that demon 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.429
 I was controlling that would explain 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.860
 that there were three types of zombies of the 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.749
 digging zombies with yellow eyes the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.759
 935 members who have just 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.649
 turn into zombies and are controlled 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.989
 by the devil using the lovers 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.909
 of blue - eyed zombie heron are 

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:15.979
 Templars became zombies 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.809
 centuries ago and are controlled by the 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.650
 demon using the rite offends the 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.720
 ether 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.759
 and zombies shine that are not controlled 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.690
 by no one and they prevent that command from being 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.690
 released from the heron 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.580
 and finally we have archi niell in 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.560
 this last song they sing elena clark and 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.810
 maluca meaning the ether samantha the 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.819
 of the heron ristov in and the devil I do not know 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.620
 interpret it well elena sigma the 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.840
 samantha of the ether speaks as if it were the 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.210
 bitch loves the universe clac does not talk 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.240
 a lot and maluca, so I'm not going to 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.370
 catch some random phrase and already 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.560
 our souls corrode and then 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.210
 then says what breaks my pride of 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.039
 destroy the skull they refer 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.009
 possibly to the devil that is 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.740
 manipulating we burn together forever 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:03.349
 waiting for you the one is that person 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.449
 that releases them the one of the samantha 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.330
 of leader was ristov in whom he exchanged 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.919
 souls with her and the one of the 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.220
 spend lover would be the protagonists 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.449
 of origins that take it out of there and that's it 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.099
 I will not analyze much more of this 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.780
 because there it is so I do not 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.210
 I see sense and step is interpreting 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.919
 things that later are not and nothing else I hope 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.210
 that you liked a greeting and we 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.210
 we see the next video bye bye
