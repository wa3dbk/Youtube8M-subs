robotic feet are always made from

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
robotic feet are always made from
scratch<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.810> you<00:00:42.810> know<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
scratch because you know they are so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.950 
scratch because you know they are so
rectangular<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:45.450> start<00:00:45.630> with<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.810> body

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
rectangular so let's start with the body

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
rectangular so let's start with the body
modifications<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:47.310> gotta<00:00:47.460> wait<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
modifications we gotta wait or so of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.600 
modifications we gotta wait or so of
course<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> necklace<00:00:50.220> cut

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
course with you know the necklace cut

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.940 
course with you know the necklace cut
off<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.149> tail<00:00:51.329> shortened<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.829> may

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
off and the tail shortened you may

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.530 
off and the tail shortened you may
notice<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> bit<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> goop

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
notice that there's a bit of goop

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.090 
notice that there's a bit of goop
sitting<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> neck<00:00:55.559> peg

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
sitting up on the neck peg

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.590 
sitting up on the neck peg
well<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> found<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.450> um<00:00:57.840> okay<00:00:59.030> usually<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.239> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
well I found that um okay usually I can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.690 
well I found that um okay usually I can
put<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> tails<00:01:01.170> head<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> wave<00:01:02.070> body<00:01:02.399> no

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
put a tails head on a wave body no

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.030 
put a tails head on a wave body no
problem<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.960> time<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.559> found<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
problem but this time I found the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.069 
problem but this time I found the
connection<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.850> loose

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
connection was a bit loose

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.230 
connection was a bit loose
this<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.560> details<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> had<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> biceps

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this was details that had the biceps

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.309 
this was details that had the biceps
ovals<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.960> maybe<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.399> some<00:01:11.639> reason<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:13.079> neck

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
ovals so maybe for some reason the neck

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.080 
ovals so maybe for some reason the neck
pic<00:01:13.560> wasn't<00:01:13.889> exactly<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.310> same<00:01:14.490> size<00:01:14.759> on<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pic wasn't exactly the same size on that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
pic wasn't exactly the same size on that
release<00:01:15.569> of<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:15.780> figure<00:01:16.079> so<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:17.009> had<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.429> use

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
release of the figure so I had to use

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.639 
release of the figure so I had to use
rubber<00:01:17.939> cement<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.689> thicken<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.259> mushroom

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
rubber cement to thicken the mushroom

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.289 
rubber cement to thicken the mushroom
peg<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.429> that<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.759> hold<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> head

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
peg so that it would hold the head

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.989 
peg so that it would hold the head
securely<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.499> very<00:01:22.799> simple<00:01:23.249> you<00:01:23.429> just<00:01:23.759> dip

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
securely it's very simple you just dip

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.870 
securely it's very simple you just dip
it<00:01:24.149> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.389> in<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:25.109> rubber<00:01:25.679> cement<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.279> then

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it in the in the rubber cement and then

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.569 
it in the in the rubber cement and then
you<00:01:26.999> let<00:01:27.149> it<00:01:27.179> dry<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.469> it<00:01:29.100> has<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> nice

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you let it dry and it's it has a nice

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
you let it dry and it's it has a nice
little<00:01:29.729> adhesion<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.109> it<00:01:31.590> won't<00:01:31.740> let

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
little adhesion to it so it won't let

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
little adhesion to it so it won't let
the<00:01:32.069> head<00:01:32.249> fall<00:01:32.490> off<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.389> not<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> strong

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the head fall off but it's not so strong

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
the head fall off but it's not so strong
that<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.289> seals<00:01:34.529> the<00:01:34.649> head<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.889> place<00:01:35.100> her

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that it seals the head in place her

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.029 
that it seals the head in place her
organic<00:01:35.849> right<00:01:36.299> arm<00:01:36.599> is<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.079> simple<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
organic right arm is pretty simple it's

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.940 
organic right arm is pretty simple it's
a<00:01:38.399> yellow<00:01:38.700> repaint<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.899> cut<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.469> sand<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a yellow repaint and I cut and sand it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.980 
a yellow repaint and I cut and sand it
off<00:01:41.099> tails<00:01:41.490> his<00:01:41.700> glove<00:01:41.969> cuff<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.569> create<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
off tails his glove cuff to create the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010 
off tails his glove cuff to create the
gloveless<00:01:43.319> look<00:01:43.709> and<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.420> time<00:01:45.749> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
gloveless look and for the first time I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
gloveless look and for the first time I
was<00:01:46.139> actually<00:01:46.380> able<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.039> do<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.579> way<00:01:47.819> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
was actually able to do it in a way that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.989 
was actually able to do it in a way that
preserves<00:01:48.299> her<00:01:48.810> wrist<00:01:49.079> articulation<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.520> this

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
preserves her wrist articulation so this

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.789 
preserves her wrist articulation so this
is<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> first<00:01:51.509> bunny<00:01:51.840> I've<00:01:52.049> made<00:01:52.289> that<00:01:52.499> still

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
is the first bunny I've made that still

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.839 
is the first bunny I've made that still
has<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.099> wrist<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.939> hand<00:01:54.740> her<00:01:55.740> left<00:01:56.219> arm<00:01:56.549> is

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
has a wrist on this hand her left arm is

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.749 
has a wrist on this hand her left arm is
the<00:01:57.450> cybernetic<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.319> and<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.249> I<00:01:59.279> had<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.639> do<00:01:59.729> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the cybernetic one and so I had to do a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.120 
the cybernetic one and so I had to do a
bit<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> sculpting<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.599> there<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.679> pre

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
bit of sculpting on there this is pre

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.300 
bit of sculpting on there this is pre
reboot<00:02:02.609> bunny<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.649> cybernetics

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
reboot bunny so the the cybernetics

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.309 
reboot bunny so the the cybernetics
aren't<00:02:05.669> just<00:02:05.849> like<00:02:06.029> tubes<00:02:06.569> they<00:02:07.020> actually

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
aren't just like tubes they actually

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.940 
aren't just like tubes they actually
have<00:02:07.529> some<00:02:07.919> muscular<00:02:08.700> detail<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.479> there

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
have some muscular detail on there

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.850 
have some muscular detail on there
I<00:02:10.950> guess<00:02:11.370> post<00:02:12.270> reboot<00:02:12.750> bunny<00:02:13.020> got<00:02:13.230> easier<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I guess post reboot bunny got easier to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
I guess post reboot bunny got easier to
draw<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:14.970> still<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:15.450> nostalgic<00:02:16.080> for

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
draw but I'm still very nostalgic for

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.400 
draw but I'm still very nostalgic for

to<00:03:35.220> support<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.909> ears<00:03:36.180> while<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> was<00:03:37.260> molding

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
to support the ears while I was molding

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.050 
to support the ears while I was molding
on<00:03:37.769> them<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.040> they'd<00:03:38.159> hold<00:03:38.310> their<00:03:38.519> shape<00:03:38.549> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
on them so they'd hold their shape and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.420 
on them so they'd hold their shape and
wouldn't<00:03:39.329> flop<00:03:39.540> over<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:41.190> pretty

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
wouldn't flop over and I was pretty

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.670 
wouldn't flop over and I was pretty
proud<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.760> how<00:03:42.030> clever<00:03:42.359> my<00:03:42.599> trick<00:03:43.019> was<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
proud of how clever my trick was and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.890 
proud of how clever my trick was and
then<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.699> realized<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.389> had<00:03:45.510> forgotten<00:03:45.810> to

this<00:04:01.019> time<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:02.340> previous<00:04:03.180> problem<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.690> I've

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
this time a previous problem that I've

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.930 
this time a previous problem that I've
always<00:04:03.930> had<00:04:04.229> with<00:04:04.440> bunny<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.979> when<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.489> made<00:04:05.729> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
always had with bunny is when I made the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.819 
always had with bunny is when I made the
feet<00:04:06.299> they<00:04:06.569> would<00:04:06.690> often<00:04:06.810> come<00:04:07.109> out<00:04:07.229> too<00:04:07.500> big

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
feet they would often come out too big

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.490 
feet they would often come out too big
and<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.609> would<00:04:08.699> make<00:04:08.879> bunny<00:04:09.180> look<00:04:09.500> unusually

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and it would make bunny look unusually

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.830 
and it would make bunny look unusually
tall<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:11.609> doesn't<00:04:11.940> help<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.180> wave<00:04:12.510> has<00:04:12.540> a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
tall it doesn't help that wave has a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.780 
tall it doesn't help that wave has a
really<00:04:13.139> long<00:04:13.319> torso<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.069> even<00:04:14.609> putting

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
really long torso so even putting

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.819 
really long torso so even putting
regular<00:04:15.239> length<00:04:15.479> legs<00:04:15.810> down<00:04:16.079> there<00:04:16.380> makes<00:04:16.650> her

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
regular length legs down there makes her

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.500 
regular length legs down there makes her
makes<00:04:17.159> a<00:04:17.280> female<00:04:17.639> character<00:04:18.030> using<00:04:18.389> them

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
makes a female character using them

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.469 
makes a female character using them
taller<00:04:18.870> anyway<00:04:19.349> but<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:20.729> these<00:04:20.909> new<00:04:20.970> feet

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
Antoine which is actually the most

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.860
