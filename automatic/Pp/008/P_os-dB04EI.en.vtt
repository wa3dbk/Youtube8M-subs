not<00:02:11.910> much<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.480> down<00:02:12.990> below<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.740> it's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
not much going on down below so it's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.590 
not much going on down below so it's
like<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> need<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.430> attack<00:02:14.819> one<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> these<00:02:15.239> top

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
like I need to attack one of these top

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.690 
like I need to attack one of these top
sides<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.500> otherwise<00:02:16.890> my<00:02:17.010> balloons<00:02:17.489> will

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
sides because otherwise my balloons will

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.180 
sides because otherwise my balloons will
be<00:02:17.900> into<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> base<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.410> my<00:02:19.500> dragons<00:02:19.920> will<00:02:20.069> be

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
be into the base and my dragons will be

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.040 
be into the base and my dragons will be
just<00:02:20.459> cleaning<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.569> those<00:02:21.690> trash

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
just cleaning up all those trash

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.390 
just cleaning up all those trash
buildings<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.709> were<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.160> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
buildings I think if I were to do this I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400 
buildings I think if I were to do this I
probably<00:02:26.610> dropped<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> Dragons<00:02:27.870> first<00:02:28.170> so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
probably dropped the Dragons first so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.020 
probably dropped the Dragons first so
the<00:02:28.500> clan<00:02:28.739> castle<00:02:28.950> would<00:02:29.250> target<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> Dragons

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the clan castle would target the Dragons

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.759 
the clan castle would target the Dragons
and<00:02:30.510> shield<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.830> bit<00:02:31.950> for<00:02:32.130> my<00:02:32.250> balloons

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
and shield a little bit for my balloons

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.550 
and shield a little bit for my balloons
so<00:02:34.769> these<00:02:34.890> wizard<00:02:35.340> towers<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.209> going<00:02:36.420> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
so these wizard towers are just going to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:46.520 
so these wizard towers are just going to
rip<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:38.010> balloons<00:02:38.310> apart<00:02:38.610> -<00:02:39.709> hmm<00:02:45.260> hey
