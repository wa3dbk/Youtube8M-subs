be a much more two-way flow of
information<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.080> these<00:03:50.890> often<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
information so that these often the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.450

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
universities they find out what it's

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.980 
universities they find out what it's
really<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.030> be<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.390> classroom<00:03:55.630> and

really like to be in a classroom and

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.690 
really like to be in a classroom and
they<00:03:56.170> find<00:03:56.410> out<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:56.740> teachers<00:03:57.190> really<00:03:57.400> need

they find out what teachers really need
to<00:03:58.420> learn<00:03:59.040> so<00:04:00.040> there's<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.340> way<00:04:00.640> flow<00:04:00.880> of

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
to learn so there's that way flow of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.400 
to learn so there's that way flow of

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
example though that's going to give

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.959 
example though that's going to give
teachers<00:05:24.929> the<00:05:25.379> wider<00:05:25.979> range<00:05:26.189> of<00:05:26.309> experiences

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
teachers the wider range of experiences

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.999 
teachers the wider range of experiences
that<00:05:27.119> they<00:05:27.270> can<00:05:27.479> then<00:05:27.659> use<00:05:27.959> and<00:05:28.409> can<00:05:28.619> improve

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
that they can then use and can improve

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.260 
that they can then use and can improve
the<00:05:29.129> quality<00:05:29.249> of<00:05:29.550> their<00:05:29.669> teaching<00:05:30.059> so

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
the quality of their teaching so

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:40.630 
the quality of their teaching so
mobility<00:05:30.719> was<00:05:30.899> a<00:05:30.929> key

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.660 

so<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.730> shows<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.890> if<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.100> send<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.460> teacher

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
so it shows that if you send a teacher

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.920 
so it shows that if you send a teacher
on<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.910> course<00:05:45.260> for<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.320> couple<00:05:46.560> days<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.780> he

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
on a course for a couple days and he

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.170 
on a course for a couple days and he
comes<00:05:49.140> back<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.530> school<00:05:49.800> often<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.580> impact<00:05:51.030> of

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
comes back to school often the impact of

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.840 
comes back to school often the impact of
that<00:05:51.330> course<00:05:51.540> may<00:05:51.720> not<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:52.080> very<00:05:52.350> big<00:05:52.730> but<00:05:53.730> if

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
that course may not be very big but if

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.240 
that course may not be very big but if
you<00:05:53.970> send<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> group<00:05:54.420> of<00:05:54.540> teachers<00:05:55.220> onto<00:05:56.220> a

you send a group of teachers onto a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
approach that group learning approach is

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.630 
approach that group learning approach is
actually<00:06:09.900> much<00:06:10.020> more<00:06:10.230> effective<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:11.160> the

actually much more effective and the
