00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.400
 good for this project we are going to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:20.680
 need a 555 two capacitors 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.650
 electrolytic of the two microphones 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.620
 one ten meters for god let's go to 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:32.330
 need a resistance of 47 cas 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.340
 and a radio frequency shock of 10 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.230
 microgenesis 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.520
 and we started by placing the socket and 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.210
 soldering the capacitors in their 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.370
 respective position place the diagram 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.700
 in the description of the video so that what 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.160
 you can download 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.480
 and together in the diagram, also the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.510
 components 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.120
 that we just said, if it 's a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.640
 problem or something or some doubt then 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.710
 you give to repeat the video and also 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.370
 follow the list of components that you 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.060
 I have just arrived 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.430
 well, we continue to place 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.430
 in this case the resistance welded 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.870
 we place 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.780
 the legs of the components forming 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.409
 the clues 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.340
 it is awesome to save 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:34.159
 a little tin and if you can do that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.700
 our circuit is more stable 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.369
 do not have losses 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.369
 we place the radiofrequency shock 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 we have to take into account to place it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.950
 away from the circuit so that the metal 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.510
 of the own welding and of the own ones 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.890
 components 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.890
 there is a little 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.880
 the image of the tracks 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.979
 we also make the relevant bridges 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.710
 observe well in the bridges that you have to 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.270
 there is one of the single leg section 6 and another 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 from leg 4 to leg 8 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.640
 we also place the cables that will go 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.470
 for 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.470
 the external components like 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.299
 the speaker of 8 years 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.299
 and a half uac 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.460
 and the 9 volt battery, well 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.800
 we have 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.069
 now we are going to place the integrated in the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.150
 Socket looks very well position 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.150
 It is important 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.870
 well then we would have our 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 it would be the result now only 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.250
 I would miss to try it
