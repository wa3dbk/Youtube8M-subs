equalized<00:02:06.299> equal<00:02:07.160> equal<00:02:08.160> yes<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
equalized equal equal yes I think it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.210 
equalized equal equal yes I think it's
equal<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.899> say<00:02:10.050> it's<00:02:10.200> equal

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
equal you can say it's equal

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.600 
equal you can say it's equal
equal<00:02:11.520> key<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.770> does<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.980> function<00:02:14.130> let's

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
equal key so how does it function let's

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.930 
equal key so how does it function let's
see<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:15.990> go<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.920> first<00:02:17.130> thing<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.400> want

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
see there we go the first thing you want

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.620 
see there we go the first thing you want
to<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.420> press<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.320> equal<00:02:20.030> there<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to do is press the equal there we go to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630 
to do is press the equal there we go to
raise<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.960> pistons<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.460> can

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
raise the pistons and then you can

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.050 
raise the pistons and then you can
control<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.270> these<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:26.060> okay

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
control it with these do I think okay

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.960 
control it with these do I think okay
these<00:02:27.360> two<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.560> NC<00:02:28.830> huh<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:29.820> it's

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
these two is to NC huh see how it's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
these two is to NC huh see how it's
unstable<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.720> very<00:02:30.960> unstable<00:02:31.440> very

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
unstable it's very unstable very

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.870 
unstable it's very unstable very
difficult<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.770> properly<00:02:34.770> maintain<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
difficult to to properly maintain the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510 
difficult to to properly maintain the
balance<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.360> life<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> death<00:02:37.310> let's<00:02:38.310> raise

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
balance of life and death let's raise

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.970 
balance of life and death let's raise
the<00:02:38.550> stop<00:02:39.360> falling<00:02:39.690> apart<00:02:39.990> stop<00:02:40.500> fall<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.800> did

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the stop falling apart stop fall I did

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.370 
the stop falling apart stop fall I did
not<00:02:41.130> edit<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.820> did<00:02:42.360> not<00:02:42.510> add<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.260> you

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
not edit you I did not add you and you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.860 
not edit you I did not add you and you
should<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.590> working<00:02:43.860> properly<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.720> did<00:02:45.720> not

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
should be working properly I did not

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.220 
should be working properly I did not
touch<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.320> there<00:02:46.620> we<00:02:46.740> go<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.990> then<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.080> can

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
touch you there we go and then you can

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.680 
touch you there we go and then you can
use<00:02:49.410> use<00:02:49.830> them<00:02:50.040> without<00:02:50.370> raising<00:02:51.180> raising<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
use use them without raising raising the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.890 
use use them without raising raising the
Pistons<00:02:52.050> but<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.250> how<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.610> gets<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.540> very

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
Pistons but see how it gets very very

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.520 
Pistons but see how it gets very very
lucky<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.920> raise<00:03:00.050> here<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.320> raise

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
lucky so you can raise here we go raise

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.480 
lucky so you can raise here we go raise
the<00:03:01.680> pistons<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.330> then<00:03:03.330> start<00:03:03.660> moving<00:03:04.490> start

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
the pistons and then start moving start

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.699 
the pistons and then start moving start
moving<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.450> how<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> moves<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> real<00:03:07.410> tank

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
moving see how it moves like a real tank

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.640 
moving see how it moves like a real tank
it's<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> most<00:03:09.090> stable<00:03:09.510> thing<00:03:09.900> on<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
it's not the most stable thing on the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.220 
it's not the most stable thing on the
planet<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:11.490> how<00:03:11.640> these<00:03:11.970> fell<00:03:12.660> apart<00:03:13.220> because

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
planet see how these fell apart because

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.050 
planet see how these fell apart because
because<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.350> these<00:03:16.680> wooden<00:03:17.190> blocks<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.700> here

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
because of these wooden blocks or here

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.660 
because of these wooden blocks or here
it's<00:03:18.600> it's<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.620> bit<00:03:19.739> tricky<00:03:19.950> yes<00:03:20.310> that

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's it's a little bit tricky yes that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's it's a little bit tricky yes that
is<00:03:20.850> true<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.660> launch<00:03:21.870> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
is true and then you can launch the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.500 
is true and then you can launch the
balls<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.470> launch<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.580> balls<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
balls and launch the balls like this and

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.570 
balls and launch the balls like this and
you<00:03:24.600> can<00:03:24.660> kill<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.170> soldiers<00:03:25.800> even<00:03:26.370> though<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
you can kill the soldiers even though I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.729 
you can kill the soldiers even though I
missed<00:03:26.910> actually<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> hit<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.290> hit<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
missed actually now I hit one I hit the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.060 
missed actually now I hit one I hit the
tree<00:03:28.950> very<00:03:29.400> nice<00:03:29.610> very<00:03:30.390> very<00:03:30.540> nice<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.830> bad

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
tree very nice very very nice not bad

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.000 
tree very nice very very nice not bad
let's<00:03:32.940> remove<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.540> dog<00:03:33.720> there<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.140> go<00:03:34.290> let's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
let's remove the dog there we go let's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.220 
let's remove the dog there we go let's
see<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> little<00:03:35.310> bit<00:03:35.519> better<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.300> then<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.080> can

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
see a little bit better and then you can

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.830 
see a little bit better and then you can
use<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.340> use<00:03:38.400> g<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.980> g<00:03:40.980> int<00:03:41.070> h<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
use you can use g and g int h to go the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.050 
use you can use g and g int h to go the
other<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:43.220> there<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.730> are<00:03:44.910> going

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
other way there you go now we are going

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
other way there you go now we are going
the<00:03:45.209> other<00:03:45.239> way<00:03:45.420> hey<00:03:46.230> beautiful<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:48.030> works<00:03:48.360> but

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the other way hey beautiful it works but

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.570 
the other way hey beautiful it works but
it<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.530> stable<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.549> only

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
it is not stable that is the only

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.140 
it is not stable that is the only
problem<00:03:51.830> adding<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.920> bit<00:03:53.100> stability<00:03:53.670> would<00:03:54.030> be

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
problem adding a bit stability would be

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.570 
problem adding a bit stability would be
nice<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:54.360> I<00:03:54.630> don't<00:03:54.900> know<00:03:55.019> how<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.470> don't<00:03:56.459> know

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
nice but I don't know how I don't know

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.500 
nice but I don't know how I don't know
how<00:03:57.049> would<00:03:58.049> stability<00:03:58.760> get<00:03:59.760> added<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.299> this

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
how would stability get added to this

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.680 
how would stability get added to this
because<00:04:01.580> there's<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.670> lot<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.940> things<00:04:03.239> going<00:04:03.390> on

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
because there's a lot of things going on

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.259 
because there's a lot of things going on
here<00:04:04.049> see<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.350> removed<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.950> de<00:04:05.070> Cooper's<00:04:05.459> so

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
here see I removed the de Cooper's so

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.870 
here see I removed the de Cooper's so
now<00:04:06.420> everything<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:06.930> like<00:04:07.430> like<00:04:08.430> we<00:04:08.760> are<00:04:08.850> in

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
now everything is like like we are in

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.080 
now everything is like like we are in
the<00:04:09.060> sea<00:04:09.590> everything<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.880> like<00:04:11.880> we<00:04:12.060> are

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
the sea everything is like we are

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.650 
the sea everything is like we are
floating<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.959> sea<00:04:13.880> blop<00:04:14.880> blop<00:04:15.090> blop<00:04:15.360> blop

it which is not something I would

it which is not something I would
recommend<00:04:37.870> recommend<00:04:38.870> unless<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.590> what

you're doing and see he is using several

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.180 
you're doing and see he is using several
wheels<00:04:42.620> up<00:04:42.860> here<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.330> if<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.630> are<00:04:44.750> using

double tank tracks and pistons I would

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.830 
double tank tracks and pistons I would
advise<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.639> use<00:04:49.850> with<00:04:50.720> how<00:04:50.870> did<00:04:51.080> he<00:04:51.320> uh

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
advise you to use with how did he uh

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.080 
advise you to use with how did he uh
he's<00:04:53.840> using<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.410> tank<00:04:55.280> trucks<00:04:55.520> are<00:04:55.610> in<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
he's using the tank trucks are in the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.080 
he's using the tank trucks are in the
middle<00:04:56.360> or<00:04:56.720> yeah<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.860> fantastic<00:04:58.130> yeah

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
middle or yeah that is fantastic yeah

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110 
middle or yeah that is fantastic yeah
that<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.389> very<00:04:59.630> nicely<00:04:59.840> designed<00:05:00.200> but<00:05:00.700> but<00:05:01.700> he

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that is very nicely designed but but he

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.690 
that is very nicely designed but but he
should<00:05:02.330> have<00:05:02.570> used<00:05:02.780> Cox<00:05:03.229> he<00:05:04.130> should<00:05:04.370> have<00:05:04.550> used

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
should have used Cox he should have used

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.690 
should have used Cox he should have used
God's<00:05:05.030> but<00:05:05.330> because<00:05:05.960> when<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:06.290> use<00:05:06.700> pistons

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
God's but because when you use pistons

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.200 
God's but because when you use pistons
and<00:05:07.910> double<00:05:08.540> tank<00:05:09.169> treads<00:05:09.580> cogs<00:05:10.580> work<00:05:10.850> much

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
and double tank treads cogs work much

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.750 
and double tank treads cogs work much
better<00:05:11.240> than<00:05:11.750> wheels<00:05:11.990> because<00:05:12.320> cogs<00:05:12.800> can<00:05:13.190> you

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
better than wheels because cogs can you

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.659 
better than wheels because cogs can you
know<00:05:13.880> go<00:05:14.090> in<00:05:14.450> between<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:15.229> these<00:05:16.070> hinges<00:05:16.340> and

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
know go in between the these hinges and

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.640 
know go in between the these hinges and
that<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.539> something<00:05:17.750> that<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.620> should

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
that is something that you should

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.710 
that is something that you should
definitely<00:05:19.039> do<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.789> if<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.210> use<00:05:20.450> this

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
definitely do if you if you use this

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.920 
definitely do if you if you use this
this<00:05:21.080> design<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.940> is<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.240> best<00:05:23.389> thing<00:05:23.539> to<00:05:23.780> do

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
this design that is the best thing to do

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.469 
this design that is the best thing to do
I<00:05:24.139> don't<00:05:24.710> know<00:05:24.889> if<00:05:25.130> you<00:05:25.220> use<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> single<00:05:25.699> if<00:05:26.300> you

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
I don't know if you use a single if you

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.409 
I don't know if you use a single if you
use<00:05:26.510> a<00:05:26.630> single<00:05:26.960> line<00:05:27.350> of<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.970> know<00:05:29.060> single

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
use a single line of you know single

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.420 
use a single line of you know single
line<00:05:29.570> of<00:05:29.600> tank<00:05:30.050> tracks<00:05:30.320> tank<00:05:30.979> treads<00:05:31.220> and

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
line of tank tracks tank treads and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.420 
line of tank tracks tank treads and
wheels<00:05:31.820> then<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:32.900> think<00:05:33.470> wheels<00:05:33.800> are<00:05:34.220> better

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
wheels then I think wheels are better

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.129 
wheels then I think wheels are better
than<00:05:34.610> cogs<00:05:34.880> but<00:05:35.180> if<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.389> use<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.510> double<00:05:35.990> line

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
than cogs but if you use the double line

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.740 
than cogs but if you use the double line
then<00:05:37.010> I<00:05:37.039> think<00:05:37.460> the<00:05:37.580> cogs<00:05:37.850> are<00:05:38.120> your<00:05:38.570> only

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
then I think the cogs are your only

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.409 
then I think the cogs are your only
option<00:05:39.200> because<00:05:39.500> using<00:05:40.099> just<00:05:40.400> wheels<00:05:40.639> will

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
option because using just wheels will

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.060 
option because using just wheels will
end<00:05:41.750> up<00:05:42.289> having<00:05:43.099> your<00:05:43.250> machine<00:05:43.610> get<00:05:43.970> fucked<00:05:44.270> or

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
end up having your machine get fucked or

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.670 
end up having your machine get fucked or
it<00:05:46.070> goes<00:05:46.220> to<00:05:46.370> shit<00:05:46.599> okay<00:05:47.599> that<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:47.840> all<00:05:48.169> for<00:05:48.530> the

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
it goes to shit okay that is all for the

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.420 
it goes to shit okay that is all for the
tank<00:05:48.919> with<00:05:49.400> tank<00:05:49.849> treads<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:50.360> pistons<00:05:51.349> it<00:05:52.010> I

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
tank with tank treads and pistons it I

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.940 
tank with tank treads and pistons it I
like<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.120> because<00:05:53.570> it<00:05:54.110> reminds<00:05:54.650> of<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.830> real

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
like it because it reminds of the real

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.879 
like it because it reminds of the real
tank<00:05:55.280> aside<00:05:55.639> from<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:56.000> blister<00:05:56.740> flaming<00:05:57.740> ball

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
tank aside from the blister flaming ball

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.650 
tank aside from the blister flaming ball
lista<00:05:58.280> cannon<00:05:59.320> but<00:06:00.340> but<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.639> like<00:06:02.090> it<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.360> like<00:06:02.479> it

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
lista cannon but but I like it I like it

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.830 
lista cannon but but I like it I like it
and<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.950> can<00:06:04.160> see<00:06:04.400> that<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.639> lot<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.570> lot<00:06:05.720> of

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
and you can see that a lot of a lot of

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.350 
and you can see that a lot of a lot of
thought<00:06:06.080> went<00:06:06.110> into<00:06:06.500> creating<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.400> I'm

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
thought went into creating it and I'm

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.420 
thought went into creating it and I'm
sure<00:06:08.690> I<00:06:08.900> am<00:06:08.990> sure<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.680> it<00:06:09.860> can<00:06:10.070> be<00:06:10.220> improved

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
sure I am sure that it can be improved

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.400 
sure I am sure that it can be improved
maybe<00:06:10.849> one<00:06:11.090> by<00:06:11.419> one<00:06:11.660> of<00:06:11.780> you<00:06:11.870> guys<00:06:12.050> who<00:06:12.380> are

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
maybe one by one of you guys who are

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.290 
maybe one by one of you guys who are
watching<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.310> feel<00:06:13.520> free<00:06:13.550> to<00:06:13.760> download<00:06:13.970> it

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
watching so feel free to download it

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.930
