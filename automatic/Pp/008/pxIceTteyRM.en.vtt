00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.120 
wanted more and we wish for more but the
game<00:00:09.929> considered<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.620> everything<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.070> think

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
game considered and everything I think

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.740 
game considered and everything I think
it's<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.330> okay

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it's it's okay

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's it's okay
the<00:00:13.320> first<00:00:13.559> half<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:15.150> were<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the first half I think we were not the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.720 
the first half I think we were not the
best<00:00:16.049> team<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.560> played<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> lot<00:00:17.340> better<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
best team we played a lot better in the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.439 
best team we played a lot better in the
second<00:00:18.060> half

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
second half

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.990 
second half
yeah<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.930> agree<00:00:19.590> Peter<00:00:20.250> he<00:00:20.460> told<00:00:20.670> us<00:00:20.789> what's

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
yeah I agree Peter he told us what's

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.880 
yeah I agree Peter he told us what's
what<00:00:21.240> she<00:00:21.359> changed<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> halftime<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
what she changed in in the halftime and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.470 
what she changed in in the halftime and
I<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.310> did<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.490> well<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
I think we did very well in the in the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390 
I think we did very well in the in the
second<00:00:24.750> half<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.990> had<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> ball<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> lot<00:00:25.650> had

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
second half we had the ball a lot had

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
second half we had the ball a lot had
patience<00:00:26.939> kept<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> ball<00:00:27.570> good<00:00:27.750> played<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
patience kept the ball good played it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.080 
patience kept the ball good played it
around<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.220> had<00:00:29.310> some<00:00:29.460> chances<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
around and we had some chances for to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.299 
around and we had some chances for to
win<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:31.349> did<00:00:31.470> he<00:00:31.529> tell<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
win it as well what did he tell you in

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.510 
win it as well what did he tell you in
during<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> interval<00:00:33.649> just<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.219> had<00:00:35.340> some

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
during the interval just we had some

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.190 
during the interval just we had some
good<00:00:35.670> periods<00:00:36.059> also<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.050> half

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
good periods also and then first half

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
good periods also and then first half
and<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.440> needed<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> continue<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> maybe

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and we needed to continue it and maybe

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
and we needed to continue it and maybe
bring<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.899> game<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.469> higher<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bring the the game a bit higher up and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
bring the the game a bit higher up and
stay<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:41.940> together<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.540> press<00:00:42.899> higher<00:00:43.110> as

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
stay more together and press higher as

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
stay more together and press higher as
well<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.309> could<00:00:44.460> keep<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.760> under

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
well so we could keep them under

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.299 
well so we could keep them under
pressure<00:00:45.260> didn't<00:00:46.260> give<00:00:46.379> them<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
pressure didn't give them time so I

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.090 
pressure didn't give them time so I
think<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> worked<00:00:47.910> pretty<00:00:48.059> well<00:00:48.590> if<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.950> at

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think it worked pretty well if I look at

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.840 
think it worked pretty well if I look at
your<00:00:50.219> performance

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
your performance

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.660 
your performance
you<00:00:51.270> were<00:00:51.360> playing<00:00:51.629> together<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.670> marriage

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you were playing together with marriage

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.209 
you were playing together with marriage
and<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.390> seems<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> work<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.960> alright<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.530> mean

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and it seems to work out alright I mean

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.880 
and it seems to work out alright I mean
it's<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.449> easy<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:57.960> amuses<00:00:58.500> me<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's pretty easy actually amuses me it

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
it's pretty easy actually amuses me it
is<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> bet<00:00:59.340> best<00:00:59.850> player<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.780> played<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and wins all his duels so it makes it
