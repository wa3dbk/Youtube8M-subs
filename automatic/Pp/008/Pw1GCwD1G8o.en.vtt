00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.929 
but it seems even then both consoles I'm
pretty<00:02:40.439> high<00:02:40.650> demand<00:02:41.040> right<00:02:41.159> now<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.760> if<00:02:41.849> you

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
pretty high demand right now so if you

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.729 
pretty high demand right now so if you
