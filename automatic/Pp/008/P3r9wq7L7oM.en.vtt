game look really professional

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
game look really professional
surprisingly<00:00:15.870> enough<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:17.220> not<00:00:17.550> all

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
surprisingly enough it's really not all

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.390 
surprisingly enough it's really not all
that<00:00:17.789> difficult<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.980> we<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.010> use<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that difficult to do we just use a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.050 
that difficult to do we just use a
command<00:00:20.760> called<00:00:20.970> set<00:00:21.720> map<00:00:21.960> tile<00:00:22.760> first<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.910> all

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
command called set map tile first of all

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.700 
command called set map tile first of all
let<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.420> explain<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> do

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.810 

essentially<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> take<00:00:29.519> this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
essentially I want to take this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.299 
essentially I want to take this
character<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.880> they<00:00:32.880> can<00:00:33.090> ask<00:00:33.690> us

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
character right here and they can ask us

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.280 
character right here and they can ask us
whether<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.690> him<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> get

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
whether or not we would like him to get

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.979 
whether or not we would like him to get
rid<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:38.100> rocky<00:00:38.550> ledge<00:00:39.030> right<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
rid of this rocky ledge right here and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
rid of this rocky ledge right here and
if<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.590> tell<00:00:40.829> him<00:00:40.980> yes<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:42.210> literally

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
if we tell him yes it will literally

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.549 
if we tell him yes it will literally
disappear<00:00:43.680> from<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> map<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> let's<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.410> down

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
disappear from the map so let's get down

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
disappear from the map so let's get down
to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.829> script<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.700> let's<00:00:47.850> open<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.149> our

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
to the script so let's open up our

00:00:48.300 --> 00:01:01.760 
to the script so let's open up our
notepad

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.870 

now<00:01:02.770> we're<00:01:02.950> going<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.190> get<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.580> actual

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
now we're going to get to the actual

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.100 
now we're going to get to the actual
command<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:05.320> write<00:01:05.560> set<00:01:06.040> map<00:01:06.280> tile<00:01:06.850> o<00:01:07.240> X<00:01:07.720> and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
command we write set map tile o X and

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.920 
command we write set map tile o X and
then<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.620> x<00:01:08.860> value<00:01:09.580> we'll<00:01:10.480> take<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.660> look<00:01:10.870> at

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
then the x value we'll take a look at

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.080 
then the x value we'll take a look at
our<00:01:11.020> map<00:01:11.290> we<00:01:12.160> want<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.370> get<00:01:12.460> rid<00:01:12.580> of<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.760> rocky

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
our map we want to get rid of this rocky

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.780 
our map we want to get rid of this rocky
ledge<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:13.870> so<00:01:14.590> essentially<00:01:15.190> all<00:01:15.220> we<00:01:15.520> need<00:01:15.670> to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
ledge here so essentially all we need to

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.150 
ledge here so essentially all we need to
do<00:01:15.940> is<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:17.650> in<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.070> x<00:01:18.490> value<00:01:19.420> y<00:01:19.930> value<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
do is put in the x value y value the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.340 
do is put in the x value y value the
value<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.820> block<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:22.450> want<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.720> replace<00:01:23.080> it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
value of the block we want to replace it

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.560 
value of the block we want to replace it
with<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:23.770> whether<00:01:24.280> or<00:01:24.430> not<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:24.729> passable<00:01:25.210> so

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
with and whether or not it's passable so

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.630 
with and whether or not it's passable so
there's<00:01:25.750> 4<00:01:26.050> values<00:01:26.500> but<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.070> very<00:01:27.250> simple

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
there's 4 values but it's very simple

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.430 
there's 4 values but it's very simple
let<00:01:27.820> me<00:01:27.850> show<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.090> how<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.360> looks<00:01:28.570> if<00:01:28.810> you're

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
let me show you how it looks if you're

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.350 
let me show you how it looks if you're
using<00:01:29.590> advanced<00:01:29.979> map<00:01:30.220> 1.92

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
using advanced map 1.92

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020 
using advanced map 1.92
it'll<00:01:31.780> automatically<00:01:32.350> convert<00:01:32.800> your<00:01:33.220> x<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:33.880> y

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
it'll automatically convert your x and y

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.359 
it'll automatically convert your x and y
values<00:01:34.090> into<00:01:34.869> hex<00:01:35.140> if<00:01:35.470> you're<00:01:35.950> using<00:01:36.070> an<00:01:36.250> older

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
values into hex if you're using an older

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.770 
values into hex if you're using an older
version<00:01:36.550> you'll<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.360> use<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.509> calculator

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
version you'll have to use a calculator

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.590 
version you'll have to use a calculator
to<00:01:38.170> convert<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.680> yourself<00:01:39.270> since<00:01:40.270> I'm<00:01:40.390> using

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
to convert it yourself since I'm using

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990 
to convert it yourself since I'm using
1.92<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.619> automatically<00:01:42.070> converts<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.580> for<00:01:42.820> me

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
1.92 it automatically converts it for me

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.930 
1.92 it automatically converts it for me
as<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.900> can<00:01:44.050> see<00:01:44.290> my<00:01:44.619> x<00:01:44.890> value<00:01:45.430> for<00:01:45.729> this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
as you can see my x value for this

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.370 
as you can see my x value for this
particular<00:01:46.150> block<00:01:46.869> is<00:01:47.140> 4<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.340> my<00:01:48.520> Y<00:01:48.790> is<00:01:49.119> f<00:01:49.570> so

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
particular block is 4 and my Y is f so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.420 
particular block is 4 and my Y is f so
what<00:01:50.500> we're<00:01:50.650> going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> do<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.400> put<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.540> x<00:01:53.229> o4<00:01:53.830> o<00:01:54.070> X

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
what we're going to do is put a x o4 o X

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.590 
what we're going to do is put a x o4 o X
o<00:01:54.670> f<00:01:55.240> o<00:01:55.649> X<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:57.160> block<00:01:57.430> we<00:01:57.670> want<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:58.000> replace<00:01:58.360> it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
o f o X the block we want to replace it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.840 
o f o X the block we want to replace it
with<00:01:58.630> now<00:01:59.470> if<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.680> want<00:01:59.920> just<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.220> regular<00:02:00.640> old

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
with now if I want just a regular old

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.609 
with now if I want just a regular old
piece<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.119> grass<00:02:01.540> I<00:02:02.020> get<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.979> 1<00:02:03.899> summer<00:02:04.899> put<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.320> 1

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
piece of grass I get a 1 summer put a 1

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.600 
piece of grass I get a 1 summer put a 1
o<00:02:05.920> X<00:02:06.550> 0<00:02:07.300> which<00:02:07.840> means<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.740> passable<00:02:09.250> block

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
o X 0 which means it's a passable block

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.180 
o X 0 which means it's a passable block
if<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.119> put<00:02:10.330> elects<00:02:10.720> 1<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.440> makes<00:02:12.010> it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
if we put elects 1 it makes it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.520 
if we put elects 1 it makes it
impassable<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.330> player<00:02:13.540> cannot<00:02:13.900> walk<00:02:14.230> in

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
impassable so the player cannot walk in

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.010 
impassable so the player cannot walk in
