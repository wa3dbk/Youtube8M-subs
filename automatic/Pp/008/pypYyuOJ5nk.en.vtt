00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.080
 on purpose 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.920
 of the road zombies we go for the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.710
 principle I bet you treyarch in your in 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 your main twitter in the reader 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
 basically the profile picture post 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.619
 of going out lately is putting pictures 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 Profile 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.039
 of the digital eye of a hand coming out with 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
 fomi of all this kind of things not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.980
 miniatures that really did not say 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 absolutely nothing today a while ago already 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.879
 they have put another profile picture 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.879
 on twitter what about trailers of the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 description by the way seems to me to be the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 image of a zombies mode advantage 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 is what I feel good about I do not know 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.070
 to you and I think it 's 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 related by zombie mode 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.300
 basically by the fact that the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 last photos of three have been in the way 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 zombies today has come out a teaser to believe 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 so zombies way too how good we 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 it indicated hardly anything 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.909
 this morning the video of the first of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 the parallel universes and good in this 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.610
 image what we can do are several 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.159
 many people things for the best novel 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.679
 nothing but there are quite a few things the first 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.539
 there is a grave a pit of Munich have 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.729
 buried someone and is already open 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.950
 like someone has left the room 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 health more and we have a gravestone in front 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.119
 a person standing a person standing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.159
 that seems to have a mark on the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 back or something so good that does not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 can indicate and we also have some 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 lines three bent lines that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 would indicate that the sound is not typical 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.349
 indication of sound we will not be giving 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.450
 an advantage perhaps of listening more to the 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.039
 dead of listening more to the zombies of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 hear more things from the zombies or not 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.140
 I know of any kind of things really 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.939
 I do not know what it can mean is or I do not know if 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.409
 it can mean I know that person 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.459
 which is said came out of that grave or 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.810
 some kind of thing or that can be 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.849
 put the zombies inside their tombs 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.409
 again because there is an advantage I do not know is 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.610
 an advantage currently strange from 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.490
 a degree advantage why 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.930
 any philippe ollÃ© of the universe has 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 been good with your theories 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.800
 hypothesis and good to remember that this 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.630
 image is official vale is totally 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.220
 twitter official of 3 with which 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.600
 we are talking something official no longer 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 We are talking about an improvement 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.990
 asshole that someone has drawn 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.280
 we are talking about an official thing and 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.450
 that's why I like this kind of news 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 not because we are talking about things that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.460
 they are not real and we can really 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.600
 will try to install find out all 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.600
 kinds of things especially games 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.400
 in the next video
