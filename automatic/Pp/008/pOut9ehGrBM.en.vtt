 more than one decade

 sometimes and and even make fun of it in the cinema 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.970
 had a good visit before quite 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.760

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.450
 remain very special 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.460
 However, according to experts beautiful 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 the words about friendship are just political 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.140
 facade agenda of the scheduled visit 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 speaks of numerous disagreements 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 for example washington refuses to pass 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 uk last britain 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 guantanamo prisoner citizen we 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.909
 talked on this topic with the professor 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 Nicholas feces and reporters Tony 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.869
 gosling for me as for historians 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 times the special relationship between us and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.020
 britain 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.380
 something from the category of mythological 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 reality there is some truth in it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 these years she has acquired all sorts of 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.039
 political fiction unconditionally 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
 between Britain and America are saved 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.000
 special relationship politician david 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 Cameron is greatly influenced 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.780
 hidden from the side of washington 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.700
 political lobbying hits 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.280
 europe across the atlantic ocean 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 However, in my opinion the United States of Great Britain 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 begins to face the response 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
 reaction the British are concerned about the availability of 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.069
 territory of their country military bases where 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 there are 10 thousand behind the barbed wire 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.359
 american soldiers and this is nobody 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.579
 regulates this issue now 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.709
 engaged by the House of Lords also many 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.540
 british parliamentarians are concerned 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.920
 that these bases can be committed 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 war crimes 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.840
 so special relationship becomes 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.980
 strained and many parliamentarians 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.290
 especially representatives of the House of Lords 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.400
 do everything possible to deliver 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.400
 America in place
