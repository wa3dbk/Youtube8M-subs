00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
another first-person shooter is kind of

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.620 
another first-person shooter is kind of
dismissive<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.810> um<00:01:28.909> it's<00:01:29.909> another

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
souls is just the polar opposite of that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.359
