difficult<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.570> level<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.170> course<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
difficult the level of course the the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.800 
difficult the level of course the the
bigger<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.490> payout<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.180> bigger<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.540> payday

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
bigger the payout the bigger the payday

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.780

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
the leader chooses to do so that might

might be able to purchase assets for

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.430 
might be able to purchase assets for
instance<00:04:01.310> like<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:01.880> gives<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.390> map<00:04:02.960> or<00:04:03.290> an

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
instance like that gives you a map or an

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.890 
instance like that gives you a map or an
overview<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.130> where<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.850> security<00:04:05.360> room<00:04:05.630> is

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
overview of where the security room is

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.200 
overview of where the security room is
or<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.320> security<00:04:06.710> cameras<00:04:07.250> are<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.000> things

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
or the security cameras are and things

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.480 
or the security cameras are and things
of<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.420> nature<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:09.380> there's<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.070> lot<00:04:10.370> of

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
of that nature so there's a lot of

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.580 
of that nature so there's a lot of
strategy<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.180> goes<00:04:11.330> in<00:04:11.630> before<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.380> even

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
strategy that goes in before you even

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.620 
strategy that goes in before you even
start<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.040> level<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.520> like<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:13.940> aspect<00:04:14.300> of

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
start the level so I like that aspect of

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.780 
start the level so I like that aspect of
it<00:04:14.750> because<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.050> like<00:04:15.380> strategy<00:04:15.740> games<00:04:16.010> then

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
it because I like strategy games then

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.120 
it because I like strategy games then
once<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.210> get<00:04:17.390> into<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.840> level<00:04:18.020> you<00:04:18.799> can<00:04:18.980> go

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
once you get into the level you can go

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.000 
once you get into the level you can go
in<00:04:19.280> there<00:04:19.520> case<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.299> joint<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:20.930> check<00:04:21.799> to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
in there case out the joint I check to

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.000 
in there case out the joint I check to
see<00:04:22.040> where<00:04:22.460> things<00:04:22.760> are<00:04:23.180> by<00:04:23.630> by<00:04:24.020> trying<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.620> you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
see where things are by by trying to you

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.340 
see where things are by by trying to you
know<00:04:25.040> not<00:04:25.760> be<00:04:26.030> too<00:04:26.330> suspicious

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
know not be too suspicious

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.930 
know not be too suspicious
and<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.650> once<00:04:28.100> you're<00:04:28.280> ready<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.640> start<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and then once you're ready to start the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.880 
and then once you're ready to start the
heist<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.540> throw<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:29.960> your<00:04:30.140> mask<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.650> it's

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
heist you throw on your mask and it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.030 
heist you throw on your mask and it's
ready<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.370> go<00:04:31.520> down<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.210> then<00:04:32.900> it's<00:04:33.200> up<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.560> you

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
ready to go down and then it's up to you

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.830 
ready to go down and then it's up to you
and<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.610> clock<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.120> your<00:04:35.210> teammates<00:04:35.630> and

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
and the clock and your teammates and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.390 
and the clock and your teammates and
making<00:04:36.170> sure<00:04:36.290> everybody's<00:04:36.800> doing<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.220> right

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
making sure everybody's doing the right

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.850 
making sure everybody's doing the right
thing<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.030> working<00:04:38.240> together<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:39.470> for<00:04:39.710> some

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
thing and working together so for some

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.290 
thing and working together so for some
of<00:04:39.950> these<00:04:40.010> missions<00:04:40.250> whenever<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.850> first<00:04:41.030> get

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
of these missions whenever you first get

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.730 
of these missions whenever you first get
started<00:04:41.420> it's<00:04:41.870> going<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.140> probably<00:04:42.410> take<00:04:42.590> you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
started it's going to probably take you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.230 
started it's going to probably take you
a<00:04:42.770> little<00:04:42.920> bit<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.250> figure<00:04:43.490> out<00:04:43.640> what<00:04:44.210> exactly

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
a little bit to figure out what exactly

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.870 
a little bit to figure out what exactly
you<00:04:44.870> have<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.080> do<00:04:45.350> but<00:04:45.650> none<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.100> them<00:04:46.310> are<00:04:46.520> like

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
you have to do but none of them are like

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.660 
you have to do but none of them are like
tremendously<00:04:47.840> difficult<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.920> figure<00:04:49.100> out<00:04:49.250> and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
tremendously difficult to figure out and

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.400 
tremendously difficult to figure out and
if<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> got<00:04:50.240> somebody<00:04:50.480> who<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.960> show<00:04:51.170> you<00:04:51.230> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
if you got somebody who can show you the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.260 
if you got somebody who can show you the
ropes<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.100> walk<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.520> through<00:04:52.550> then

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
ropes and kind of walk you through then

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.850 
ropes and kind of walk you through then
that<00:04:53.510> definitely<00:04:53.720> helps<00:04:54.260> out<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.410> lot

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
that definitely helps out a lot

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.800 
that definitely helps out a lot
but<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.250> missions<00:04:55.580> like<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.940> mentioned<00:04:56.390> they

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
but the missions like I mentioned they

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.620 
but the missions like I mentioned they
change<00:04:57.230> up<00:04:57.530> every<00:04:57.950> time<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.310> play<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.450> way

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
change up every time you play so the way

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.050 
change up every time you play so the way
the<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.470> police<00:05:00.800> come<00:05:01.160> in<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.580> way<00:05:01.760> the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
the the police come in the way the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.630 
the the police come in the way the
things<00:05:02.450> are<00:05:02.660> set<00:05:02.960> up<00:05:03.140> different<00:05:03.680> items<00:05:04.430> in

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
things are set up different items in

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.630 
things are set up different items in
different<00:05:04.790> locations<00:05:05.800> things<00:05:06.800> change<00:05:07.460> around

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
different locations things change around

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.300 
different locations things change around
dynamically<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.440> keeps<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.950> game

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
dynamically and so it keeps the game

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.060 
dynamically and so it keeps the game
with<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.030> nice<00:05:11.480> flow<00:05:11.870> where<00:05:12.230> it<00:05:12.380> doesn't<00:05:12.710> feel

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
with a nice flow where it doesn't feel

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.800 
with a nice flow where it doesn't feel
still<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.640> doesn't<00:05:13.850> doesn't<00:05:14.420> feel<00:05:14.570> like

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
still it doesn't doesn't feel like

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.510 
still it doesn't doesn't feel like
you're<00:05:15.020> doing<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.350> lot<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.040> same<00:05:16.250> stuff

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
you're doing a lot of the same stuff

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.850 
you're doing a lot of the same stuff
just<00:05:16.850> over<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.390> over<00:05:17.680> repeatedly<00:05:18.680> because

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
just over and over repeatedly because
