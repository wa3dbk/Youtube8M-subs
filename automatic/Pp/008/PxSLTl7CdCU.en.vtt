 the plan of action of the Vera de la Trobe but advocated the case of the 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.349

 to file a motion for summary judgment 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 and to us 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.019
 a bet on the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.300
 the claim of political immunity 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.510
 process or after advanced state apparatus 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 another poll 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
 all the prosecution is not ready 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.940
 I think we're going to vote 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.990
 we do not have all the favorable answers 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.920
 be sorry to play behind 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 press reports 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 the goal served for little 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 on the other hand he probably does what he does not want to believe 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910
 enter the process 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.910
 he is pure a teacher

 now we move to quarters 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.400
 the federal prosecutor's office what he wants efe

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 the ephemeral career passenger 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760
