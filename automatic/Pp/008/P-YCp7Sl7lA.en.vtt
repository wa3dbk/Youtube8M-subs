right<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.329> risk<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.260> tire<00:03:18.060> bursting<00:03:19.060> is

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
right the risk of the tire bursting is

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.280 
right the risk of the tire bursting is
quite<00:03:20.260> high<00:03:20.530> now<00:03:21.150> since<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.269> carcass<00:03:22.720> itself

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
quite high now since the carcass itself

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.979 
quite high now since the carcass itself
has<00:03:23.470> been<00:03:23.650> damages<00:03:24.250> that's<00:03:24.970> taking<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.360> really

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
this vehicle because the back end is

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.310 
this vehicle because the back end is
bouncing<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.360> any<00:04:44.050> bumps<00:04:44.440> or<00:04:44.530> whatever<00:04:44.860> the
