as<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:01.020> can<00:00:01.199> see<00:00:01.410> there's<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.680> little<00:00:01.829> bit<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:02.129> a

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
as you can see there's a little bit of a

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.100 
as you can see there's a little bit of a
breeze<00:00:02.520> out<00:00:02.760> here<00:00:02.790> this<00:00:03.120> morning<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.720> that

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
breeze out here this morning and that

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.460 
breeze out here this morning and that
makes<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.500> tough<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:05.359> park<00:00:06.359> over<00:00:06.779> fish<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.440> I

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
makes it tough to park over fish that I

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.230 
makes it tough to park over fish that I
mark<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> graft<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.580> Jake<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.120> him

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
mark on the graft and Jake for him

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.419 
mark on the graft and Jake for him
because<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.870> by<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> time<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> jig<00:00:11.219> gets

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
because the by the time the jig gets

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.049 
because the by the time the jig gets
down<00:00:11.639> there

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
down there

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.169 
down there
the<00:00:12.179> winds<00:00:12.480> push<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.900> off<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.230> fish<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.730> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the winds push me off the fish so I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
the winds push me off the fish so I
haven't<00:00:15.690> been<00:00:15.809> able<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.139> fish<00:00:16.440> where<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
haven't been able to fish where I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.490 
haven't been able to fish where I
normally<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:19.020> where<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> know

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
normally like to and where I know

there's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.859> whole<00:00:20.039> pile<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.340> fish<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.180> had<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
there's a whole pile of fish I had to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.029 
there's a whole pile of fish I had to
come<00:00:21.930> over<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.350> where<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:22.890> of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
come over here where it's kind of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
come over here where it's kind of
sheltered<00:00:23.820> from<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> wind<00:00:24.300> trying<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> find<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
sheltered from the wind trying to find a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.839 
sheltered from the wind trying to find a
few<00:00:25.410> fish<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.220> can't<00:00:26.430> pick<00:00:26.580> away<00:00:26.820> at

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
few fish and see if I can't pick away at

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.630 
few fish and see if I can't pick away at
them<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.710> who<00:00:28.710> knows<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.039> will<00:00:29.130> happen<00:00:29.160> let's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
them so who knows what will happen let's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:01:12.300 
them so who knows what will happen let's
give<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> shot<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.260> goes

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.460 

he<00:01:13.000> was<00:01:13.119> suspended<00:01:13.750> I<00:01:13.869> could<00:01:14.020> see<00:01:14.170> him<00:01:14.290> on<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
he was suspended I could see him on the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.620 
he was suspended I could see him on the
graph<00:01:15.720> probably<00:01:17.670> 20<00:01:18.670> feet<00:01:18.880> up<00:01:19.060> off<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.479> bottom

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
graph probably 20 feet up off the bottom

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.719 
graph probably 20 feet up off the bottom
so<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.079> dropped<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.470> jig<00:01:20.740> down<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.399> above<00:01:21.579> his

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
so I dropped the jig down just above his

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:36.060 
so I dropped the jig down just above his
head<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.180> he<00:01:22.240> came<00:01:22.360> up<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.659> hit<00:01:22.840> it<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.890> too

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
head and he came up and hit it it's too

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
windy today to hover over fish the way I

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.520 
windy today to hover over fish the way I
normally<00:01:38.259> like<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:39.189> jigging<00:01:39.579> but<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.560 
normally like to and jigging but I just
moved<00:01:41.740> along<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.250> found<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.549> pot<00:01:42.759> of<00:01:42.939> fish<00:01:43.149> that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
moved along and found a pot of fish that

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.350 
moved along and found a pot of fish that
were<00:01:43.810> suspended<00:01:44.520> dropped<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.640> jig<00:01:45.880> down<00:01:46.030> just

were suspended dropped the jig down just
above<00:01:46.600> him<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:46.990> could<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.409> jig<00:01:47.649> on<00:01:47.799> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
above him and I could see the jig on the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.130 
above him and I could see the jig on the
graph<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:49.030> also<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> fish<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:49.929> watched

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
graph and also the fish and I watched

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.199 
graph and also the fish and I watched
this<00:01:50.319> fish<00:01:50.590> come<00:01:50.799> up<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.159> smoke<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.700> jig<00:01:51.970> he

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
this fish come up and smoke the jig he

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.419 
this fish come up and smoke the jig he
was<00:01:52.360> about<00:01:52.479> 10<00:01:52.750> feet<00:01:52.959> above<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.289> fish<00:01:53.679> the

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
was about 10 feet above the fish the

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.490 
was about 10 feet above the fish the
fish<00:01:54.459> were<00:01:54.789> probably<00:01:55.030> 20<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.840> 30<00:01:56.080> feet<00:01:56.170> off<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
fish were probably 20 to 30 feet off the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.059 
fish were probably 20 to 30 feet off the
bottom<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:58.349> when<00:01:59.349> the<00:01:59.439> conditions<00:01:59.920> don't

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
bottom so when the conditions don't

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.880 
bottom so when the conditions don't
cooperate<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.689> just<00:02:01.929> got<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.200> go<00:02:02.319> with<00:02:02.349> it<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
cooperate you just got to go with it and

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.919 
cooperate you just got to go with it and
figure<00:02:03.340> out<00:02:03.429> a<00:02:03.490> way<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.700> make<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.060> work<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.659> I

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
figure out a way to make it work so I

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.660 
figure out a way to make it work so I
guess<00:02:05.349> I'll<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.649> keep<00:02:05.830> moving<00:02:06.189> around<00:02:06.280> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
guess I'll just keep moving around and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.490 
guess I'll just keep moving around and
trying<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.939> drop<00:02:07.209> on<00:02:07.450> fish<00:02:07.720> but<00:02:07.959> it's<00:02:08.259> tough

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
trying to drop on fish but it's tough

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.160 
trying to drop on fish but it's tough
with<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:08.830> wind<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:10.690> if<00:02:10.750> we<00:02:10.869> can't<00:02:11.080> get

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
with this wind see if we can't get

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.960 
with this wind see if we can't get
another<00:02:11.440> one

to<00:02:50.750> choose<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> baitcaster<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:52.190> spinning<00:02:52.610> rod

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
to choose a baitcaster over spinning rod

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.680 
to choose a baitcaster over spinning rod
because<00:02:53.300> bait<00:02:53.690> casters<00:02:54.230> have<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> much<00:02:54.830> faster

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
because bait casters have a much faster

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.690 
because bait casters have a much faster
line<00:02:56.690> retrieval<00:02:57.350> rate<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:57.920> when<00:02:58.580> you're

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
line retrieval rate so when you're

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.240 
line retrieval rate so when you're
fishing<00:02:59.090> 80<00:02:59.300> or<00:02:59.540> 100<00:02:59.840> feet<00:02:59.870> down<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.070> want

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
fishing 80 or 100 feet down and you want

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.400 
fishing 80 or 100 feet down and you want
to<00:03:01.310> switch<00:03:01.550> spots<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:02.270> bait<00:03:02.570> caster<00:03:02.780> picks<00:03:03.230> up

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
to switch spots a bait caster picks up

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.130 
to switch spots a bait caster picks up
your<00:03:03.560> spoon<00:03:03.950> much<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:05.030> quicker<00:03:05.270> than<00:03:06.110> a

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
your spoon much much quicker than a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.890 
your spoon much much quicker than a
spinning<00:03:06.680> reel<00:03:06.830> ever<00:03:07.130> could<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.090> after<00:03:08.870> a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
spinning reel ever could and so after a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.020 
spinning reel ever could and so after a
while<00:03:09.110> bait<00:03:09.530> caster<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.220> pays<00:03:10.430> off<00:03:10.459> with

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
while bait caster really pays off with

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.240 
while bait caster really pays off with
the<00:03:11.120> high<00:03:11.270> gear<00:03:11.570> ratio<00:03:12.050> here's<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.010> better<00:03:13.160> look

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
the high gear ratio here's a better look

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.040 
the high gear ratio here's a better look
at<00:03:13.520> some<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.850> spoons<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.450> like<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.840> use

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
at some of the spoons that I like to use

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.800 
at some of the spoons that I like to use
on<00:03:16.040> any<00:03:16.190> given<00:03:16.520> day<00:03:16.640> some<00:03:17.180> colors<00:03:17.510> will<00:03:17.690> be

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
on any given day some colors will be

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.060 
on any given day some colors will be
better<00:03:18.020> than<00:03:18.230> others<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:18.740> it<00:03:18.830> pays<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
better than others so it pays to

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.150 
better than others so it pays to
experiment<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> couple<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.570> your<00:03:20.600> box

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
experiment and have a couple in your box

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.100 
experiment and have a couple in your box
it<00:03:22.160> also<00:03:22.340> pays<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.910> have<00:03:23.060> some<00:03:23.300> glow<00:03:23.570> stuff<00:03:23.930> as

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
it also pays to have some glow stuff as

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.210 
it also pays to have some glow stuff as
well<00:03:24.320> for<00:03:24.590> those<00:03:24.709> low<00:03:24.920> light<00:03:25.160> periods<00:03:25.840> so

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
well for those low light periods so

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.259 
well for those low light periods so
these<00:03:28.220> are<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:29.180> made<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.600> lead<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:31.269> you

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
these are all just made of lead and you

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.910 
these are all just made of lead and you
drop<00:03:32.540> them<00:03:32.720> down<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.590> park<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
action on them they obviously don't have

any action whatsoever other than a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.729 
any action whatsoever other than a
little<00:03:38.480> bit<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.630> jigging<00:03:39.110> motion<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.560> give
