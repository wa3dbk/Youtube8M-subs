00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
nerf and stuff like that it's made it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
nerf and stuff like that it's made it
really<00:01:39.360> hard<00:01:39.479> I've<00:01:39.840> gettin<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.380> close<00:01:40.680> but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
really hard I've gettin really close but

I can't beat them and I think the answer
is<00:01:42.900> just<00:01:43.200> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.500> couple<00:01:43.890> more

1414<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:58.050> let's<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.410> if<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.650> do<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.979> instant

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
1414 so let's see if I do it instant

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.890 
1414 so let's see if I do it instant
it's<00:01:59.630> 1106<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.050> do<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.440> this<00:02:01.590> its<00:02:02.900> 993

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
it's 1106 if I do it like this its 993

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's 1106 if I do it like this its 993
and<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:05.070> 100<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.970> actually<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and then 100 I think it's actually the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
and then 100 I think it's actually the
same<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> money<00:02:07.759> so

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
same if you don't have the money so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
same if you don't have the money so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
right here always kills me I don't think

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.839 
right here always kills me I don't think
those<00:03:04.680> mines<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.190> back<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.520> really<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
those mines in the back will really do

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.070 
those mines in the back will really do
too<00:03:06.060> much<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> mine<00:03:06.870> right<00:03:07.050> here

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
too much and there's a mine right here

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.000 
too much and there's a mine right here
I'm<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.770> gonna<00:03:08.190> run<00:03:08.490> through<00:03:08.760> them

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
I'm just kind of gonna run through them

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.500 
I'm just kind of gonna run through them
let<00:03:11.010> me<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.400> though<00:03:11.670> I'm<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.390> try

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
let me do this though I'm going to try

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.070 
let me do this though I'm going to try
to<00:03:12.540> take<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.500> clear<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> live

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
to take out this to clear a live

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.430 
to take out this to clear a live
ol<00:03:14.170> area<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:16.120> where<00:03:16.300> my<00:03:16.330> warriors<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:17.020> stand

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
ol area to where my warriors can stand

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.210 
ol area to where my warriors can stand
so<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.280> took<00:03:18.550> three<00:03:18.760> artillery<00:03:19.420> shots<00:03:19.720> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
so that took three artillery shots I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.200 
so that took three artillery shots I
should<00:03:21.220> probably<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.700> same<00:03:21.730> thing<00:03:22.120> over

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
should probably do the same thing over

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.990 
should probably do the same thing over
here<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:22.510> these<00:03:22.630> flamethrowers<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> I

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
here with these flamethrowers but I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.190 
here with these flamethrowers but I
don't<00:03:25.120> know<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.330> might<00:03:25.450> get<00:03:25.600> too<00:03:25.690> expensive

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
don't know that might get too expensive

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.690 
don't know that might get too expensive
I<00:03:26.290> think<00:03:26.500> I'll<00:03:26.620> just<00:03:26.650> shocked<00:03:27.040> bomb<00:03:27.280> knows<00:03:27.520> to

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I think I'll just shocked bomb knows to

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.490 
I think I'll just shocked bomb knows to
subdue<00:03:27.970> them<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.450> entire<00:03:28.720> time<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.350> so

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
subdue them the entire time here so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.280 
subdue them the entire time here so
let's<00:03:30.190> go<00:03:30.310> ahead<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.490> throw<00:03:30.700> two<00:03:30.910> smokes<00:03:31.290> drop

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
let's go ahead and throw two smokes drop

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.840 
let's go ahead and throw two smokes drop
