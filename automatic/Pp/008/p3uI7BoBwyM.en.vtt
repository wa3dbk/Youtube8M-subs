00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.140
 hi total this is fish to youtube and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 in this video, well, I'm going to show you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 some games from the appstore that have 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 seemed pretty sure the truth is 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 that did not go up any 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 video about games since then when 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.349
 the games that the pistolita saw 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.829
 I really do not like much 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.390
 good the compiled for this video 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.000
 some games that have seemed to me 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.489
 It was worth the pain and I hope you like it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.169
 well let's see if this video comes 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.510
 like the previous ones more or less to about 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.430
 200 lines since this to me so good 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 motivated mogollÃ³n to continue doing 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 this type of videos also good 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.990
 I wanted to tell you that lately I'm going to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.380
 have much more time to upload videos 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.180
 and the channel will be more active 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.370
 well guys I do not roll more than 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 I 'm sure you're anxious to see the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.630
 games and let's go with the video the first 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 game that I'm going to teach you is called grid 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.410
 reiter and you can find it so 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 free the appstore 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.980
 I do not know to you for me this game I 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.079
 remember very much the games of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.850
 cars that we played in the 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.020
 recreational machines when 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 we were little 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 good this the car game as you see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.869
 is the typical Japanese Chinese game that is 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.090
 super fun I liked this 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.770
 game because the rivals are very 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.929
 competitive from the first curve 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 until the last and we can go making a 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.399
 little drift in the curves what 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.079
 makes it much more entertaining obviously not 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 is the best car game graphically 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.119
 not much less but well under my 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 point of view is the most fun to the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.200
 that I've played so far so 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.090
 I highly recommend you to install it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.950
 since well I thought it was a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 terrific game the next game is 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.220
 teaching is called boom beach and the truth 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.229
 is that it is a game that is squeezing 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.119
 very much the appstore and one that I am very 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 supporter of playing these types of games 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.470
 because the networks that we like a lot 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.539
 but with this game I got hooked 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.640
 quite the objective of this game is 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.969
 invade the beaches that we have around 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.310
 and prevent them from invading our 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.560
 For this, well, we will build things 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 How good towers can be for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 bomb the enemies 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.940
 good as you see now has gone to a beach 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.160
 enemy to which then well I'm going to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.740
 attack to make me with his gold wood 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200
 etcetera is worth how that's good out there 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.319
 I am deploying my small troops in 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.630
 boat and well I said what 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.640
 I have to do is load all the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.040
 beaches that I have around for 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.959
 get their resources and every time then 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 when the game is becoming more and more 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.880
 difficult is worth a game that I like 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.489
 I say there is no waste either 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.230
 and if you like this kind of games, 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.910
 I highly recommend that you install this 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.769
 game is called collectibles and we can 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.780
 find a free way in the 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.040
 winston as you see we are an army of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.810
 soldiers that we have to go doing 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.370
 different missions to move to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.590
 soldier we just have to go 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 clicking your finger on the screen is worth 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.330
 and as you can see the four of them are here 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.209
 we 've loaded one now we're going 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.060
 to load the others let's see if the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.040
 we kill yes and good if you look at the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.720
 bottom part we have a series of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.430
 letters that we can modify them before 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.350
 that the game starts, they have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.450
 different functions I have put for 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.130
 throw bombs and knives to heal my 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.440
 release 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.990
 to use it simply arrest 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.730
 we saw the d2 of the letter so 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.920
 Our goal is worth as you see them there 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.800
 throw a grenade and weakened them until 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.390
 It is a game that is very good to me 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.030
 I liked it had never played 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.430
 a game of this style is worth enough 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.040
 these controls and so on and the truth is 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.080
 that has not disappointed me, nothing is super 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.360
 well it's very entertaining and the missions 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.910
 They are also very curried because I have 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.890
 said with let die balls is very 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.720
 recommended that you install this game 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.610
 it's called officier you can find it 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.050
 for free in the app store as 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.730
 this is a very curious game in which 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.310
 we have to fuck from the back table 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.050
 to our co-worker 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.200
 throwing him a lot of things as you see 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.850
 we have to normally choose the part 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.970
 left or on the right of the screen 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.500
 a fan will appear in which 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.880
 is going to mark the time in the part of 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.130
 down is worth as it is 0.88 1.17 1.6 vale 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.900
 that will divert the object that you 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.420
 let's throw the left part as 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.489
 you see we have the score the truth is 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.950
 which is a very curious game and very 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.459
 entertained to have a laugh with 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.550
