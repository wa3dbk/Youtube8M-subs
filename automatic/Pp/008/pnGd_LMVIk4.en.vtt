00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.150
 Hi I am going to give you the four strands 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.400
 to 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.099
 high slider braid show with 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.930
 actually not so good how man i have 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.340
 a tuft of hair caught i leave it here 8 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.279
 how to see the head because it is a hair 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.140
 which is nice and long but you can do it 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.010
 do it wherever you want 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.489
 of course grab her well wet and well now 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.470
 I mean I really good pressure and go at 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.400
 push the braid up later 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:47.430
 not that it's going to be fluffy 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm going to divide this place into 4 equal ones 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 strands 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.750
 this way what you do with multiple 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.650
 strand braiding is that your eyes flash 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.699
 fact under the picking and again the robbery 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.699
 and you keep repeating that 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.470
 I go through this and below it 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.659
 here the over and I need nice bow 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.700
 is in that bad i say you taste this 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.700
 pluck back to 3rd place 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.210
 over it underneath over it and I go 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.010
 that back 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.620
 over it don't do that at the same time 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.650
 in between excellent fillets 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:44.500
 that series has it scroll up with 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:50.710
 a few left in a second string 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.150
 but this place is over 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.450
 underneath 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.680
 over it and that is back I this one 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.790
 braid loosely 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:07.149
 put in tight which is easy 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:14.060
 it turns up it is back 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:17.080
 over it ok and I do it over again 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.080
 underneath 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.910
 so you must be very beautiful that is a bow 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.710
 fight again 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:54.980
 is also on this gentleman is nature of 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.980
 the way or my end 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.580
 under really careful that you are not too tight 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.730
 insect so that it is two fingers loosely 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.730
 food 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.800
 this is enough is the end and i have 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.990
 two club song records actually 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.520
 what i do now 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.910
 so the second place 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.360
 well I separate other clicks 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.580
 what i put together this way 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.410
 I'm sitting here with the thumb and forefinger 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.790
 if the later would still anthonis 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.290
 agree mussel 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:02.050
 I succeed here with index finger afterwards 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:02.050
 should run a little good drive 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.650
 when the light got this way 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:21.760
 it is absolutely right what you are doing 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:26.180
 make this club hits with your fingers again 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.560
 is also possible with a can of course no longer 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.950
 burden then you get him careless 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.950
 to undertake 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.820
 further down 210 are meditating 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.820
 takes shape 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.630
 this sir 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.730
 then I fix it a little bit 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.940
 uses really small pieces 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.940
 in front of 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:19.730
 more spoken upstream 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.730
 braid
