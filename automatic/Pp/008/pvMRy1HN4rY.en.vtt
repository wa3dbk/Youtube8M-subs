using<00:00:06.180> HT<00:00:06.990> access<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.300> reason<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.690> want<00:00:09.870> to

using HT access so the reason I want to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.930 
using HT access so the reason I want to
do<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:10.620> if<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.340> hacker<00:00:11.550> ever

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
do this is because if a hacker ever

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.299 
do this is because if a hacker ever
tries<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.330> target<00:00:12.780> your<00:00:12.900> website<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> the

index and next up PHP we're going to add

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.800 
index and next up PHP we're going to add
one<00:01:36.270> simple<00:01:37.020> line<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:38.479> let<00:01:39.479> me<00:01:39.509> make

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
one simple line and that is let me make

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.179 
one simple line and that is let me make
it<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.229> cleaner<00:01:41.570> allow<00:01:43.189> override

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it a little bit cleaner allow override

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.780 
it a little bit cleaner allow override
its<00:01:44.820> override<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.600> art<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.110> -<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:47.399> -

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
its override have one art or - I think -

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.889 
its override have one art or - I think -
let's<00:01:48.630> hope<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.200> allow<00:01:49.920> override<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:51.060> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
let's hope so so allow override all so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.539 
let's hope so so allow override all so
now<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:52.380> giving<00:01:52.500> PHP<00:01:53.070> myadmin

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
now you're giving PHP myadmin

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.499 
now you're giving PHP myadmin
you're<00:01:54.210> saying<00:01:54.479> okay<00:01:54.860> we<00:01:55.860> allow<00:01:56.219> HT<00:01:56.850> access<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you're saying okay we allow HT access to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're saying okay we allow HT access to
override<00:01:57.869> default<00:01:58.590> settings<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.670> your<00:02:00.270> setup

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
override default settings for your setup

so that's all we have to do like I said
one<00:02:03.450> simple<00:02:03.840> line<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> code<00:02:04.110> control<00:02:04.619> X<00:02:04.860> Y

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
one simple line of code control X Y

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
one simple line of code control X Y
enter<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.119> boom<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.680> go<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.330> order

unless we know the password to that then

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.449 
unless we know the password to that then
this<00:03:17.370> isn't<00:03:18.329> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.870> even<00:03:19.139> show<00:03:19.349> now<00:03:20.129> since

we're gonna be setting up the password

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.900 
we're gonna be setting up the password

and where the system administrator we

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.400 
and where the system administrator we
obviously<00:03:24.060> know<00:03:24.449> it<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:25.019> we're<00:03:25.139> gonna<00:03:25.230> hit

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
obviously know it so we're gonna hit

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.750 
obviously know it so we're gonna hit
enter<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.919> then<00:03:26.099> we're<00:03:26.280> gonna<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.579> access

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
to this sounds confusing but it's

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.610 
to this sounds confusing but it's
actually<00:03:28.949> incredibly<00:03:29.370> easy<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.409> that's<00:03:31.409> what

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
actually incredibly easy so that's what

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.629 
actually incredibly easy so that's what
we're<00:03:31.739> gonna<00:03:31.799> be<00:03:31.980> doing<00:03:32.220> that's<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> real

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
we're gonna be doing that's the real

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
I'm gonna log in do I want to save that

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.470 
I'm gonna log in do I want to save that
nope<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.540> now<00:06:04.380> I<00:06:04.410> have<00:06:04.770> access<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.490> phpMyAdmin

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
nope and now I have access to phpMyAdmin

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.350 
nope and now I have access to phpMyAdmin
which<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.870> hacker<00:06:07.140> would<00:06:07.890> not<00:06:08.130> get<00:06:08.400> so<00:06:09.060> now<00:06:09.300> we

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
which a hacker would not get so now we

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.730 
which a hacker would not get so now we
can<00:06:09.600> just<00:06:09.720> log<00:06:09.990> in<00:06:10.200> as<00:06:10.440> usual<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.960> boom<00:06:13.230> check

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
can just log in as usual so boom check

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.240 
can just log in as usual so boom check
it<00:06:13.919> out

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
it out

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.720 
it out
so<00:06:14.700> it's<00:06:15.690> essentially<00:06:16.290> just<00:06:16.440> another<00:06:17.100> step

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
so it's essentially just another step

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.090 
so it's essentially just another step
another<00:06:18.060> precaution<00:06:18.510> that<00:06:18.840> you<00:06:18.900> can<00:06:19.050> take<00:06:19.260> to

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
another precaution that you can take to

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.180 
another precaution that you can take to
defend<00:06:20.730> off<00:06:21.030> hackers<00:06:21.630> so<00:06:22.200> there<00:06:22.740> you<00:06:22.830> go<00:06:22.980> now

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
defend off hackers so there you go now

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.310 
defend off hackers so there you go now
you<00:06:23.669> understand<00:06:24.270> how<00:06:24.450> to<00:06:24.480> use<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.750> why<00:06:25.169> it's

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
you understand how to use it why it's

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.270 
you understand how to use it why it's
useful<00:06:25.470> and<00:06:26.010> yeah<00:06:26.280> see<00:06:26.640> you<00:06:26.730> guys<00:06:26.760> next<00:06:26.970> video
