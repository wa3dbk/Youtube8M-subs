a car now I've already cut my circle and
give<00:00:26.760> them<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.390> glue<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
give them you just glue and this it to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.320 
give them you just glue and this it to
the<00:00:28.590> bottom<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> glue<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the bottom of it I'm going to glue this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.659 
the bottom of it I'm going to glue this
in<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> side<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> know

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
in there to the side of it you know

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.160 
in there to the side of it you know
what'll<00:00:32.880> end<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.120> happening<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.930> put

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
what'll end up happening is you just put

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
what'll end up happening is you just put
I<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.710> it'll<00:00:34.920> fit<00:00:35.010> four<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.489> five<00:00:35.640> balls

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I think it'll fit four or five balls

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040 
I think it'll fit four or five balls
haven't<00:00:36.210> tried<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> yet<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
haven't tried it yet and then you just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
haven't tried it yet and then you just
put<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> buffer<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:38.219> top<00:00:38.550> with<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.820> polisher

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
put the buffer on top with your polisher

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
put the buffer on top with your polisher
and<00:00:39.559> polish<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> balls<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.309> simple<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
and polish the balls then it's simple a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
and polish the balls then it's simple a
story<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> tie<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> buffer

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
story also don't have to tie the buffer

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
story also don't have to tie the buffer
up<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.600> bucket<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> could<00:00:46.379> actually

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
up into a bucket and I could actually

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.660 
up into a bucket and I could actually
use<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:46.950> something<00:00:47.100> else<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> ever

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
use it for something else have you ever

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
use it for something else have you ever
wanted<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
wanted to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
wanted to
besides<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> buffer<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.760> glue<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.270> most

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
besides the buffer this glue was most

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
besides the buffer this glue was most
expensive<00:00:51.960> thing<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> I'm<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> little

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
expensive thing and I'm out a little

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.350 
expensive thing and I'm out a little
overkill<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:53.940> probably<00:00:54.000> find

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
overkill on it you could probably find

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
overkill on it you could probably find
cheaper<00:00:54.989> glue<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.980> some<00:00:56.309> laying

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
cheaper glue or if you have some laying

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.310 
cheaper glue or if you have some laying
around<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.510> can't<00:00:57.690> find<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
around like I do I just can't find it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
around like I do I just can't find it
side<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.980> bottle<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.660> don't<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
side of the bottle and you don't want to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.270 
side of the bottle and you don't want to
do<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:02.690> run<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.040> I'll<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
do is run that up here and I'll just

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
do is run that up here and I'll just
spray<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> bottom<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.920> bucket

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
spray the bottom of the other bucket

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:21.200 
spray the bottom of the other bucket
here

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.460 

and<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.330> should<00:01:22.450> probably<00:01:22.690> use<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.200> outside

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
and you should probably use this outside

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:34.190 
and you should probably use this outside
but<00:01:24.040> I'm<00:01:24.159> not<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.550> smart<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:28.180> our<00:01:32.729> carpet
