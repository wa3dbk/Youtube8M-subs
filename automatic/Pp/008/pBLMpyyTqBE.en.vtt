00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.610
 Welcome to the big topic 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.630
 I am the broadcaster Wang Andi. 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.940
 This week's theme? 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.840
 Light and shadow graffiti 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.360
 I believe that everyone should have played a fairy when they were young. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.150
 We all like to take pictures to draw pictures, right? 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.170
 The light and shadow graffiti is very similar to the fairy stick. 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.920
 However, its principle and method of action are more detailed. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.440
 So next we have to share 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.360
 Five light and shadow graffiti notes 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.040
 Let everyone 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.860
 Easily easy 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.570
 Become the flirtatious hand of the light and shadow graffiti world! 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 it is good! 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.670
 The first point is: what you can do at night! 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.470
 That's right 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.110
 Speaking of this flirting sage 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.830
 I am going to talk about things that I can do some nights. 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.130
 But don't think about it here. 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.030
 Because I am serious about discussing 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.150
 About the principle of light and shadow graffiti 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.520
 That is, "long exposure" 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.530
 What is the principle? 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.440
 Let's take a look at the short play below to know! 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.900
 we 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.800
 Take a photo! 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.420
 Good~~~ 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.350
 Lend me to see, lend me 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.640
 how is it going? what do you think? 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.940
 Look at what I shot! 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.940
 Rotten dead... 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.780
 How are they all paste! ? 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 Why is the photo taken every time an appointment always blurry? 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.050
 In fact, it is mainly due to the lack of environmental light source. 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.560
 Insufficient ambient light source 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.790
 The speed of the shutter will become very slow 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.410
 It takes a little more time to collect the light source 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.420
 Light and shadow graffiti is using this principle 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.560
 When we manually adjust the shutter speed to be slower? 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.260
 It can be like this 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.390
 Collect the shadow of light! 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.000
 The second point: bright things can be 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.220
 Except for the forehead 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.910
 Let's take a photo! 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.240
 Sure! Any bright things can be 喔~ 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.740
 Then... what about this? 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.540
 Can you! 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.140
 that... 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 what about this? 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.770
 Can you! 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.450
 that... 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.270
 what about this? 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.180
 Can you! 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.980
 that... 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.490
 what about this? 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 it is good 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.730
 The second thing? 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.620
 Is looking for a suitable illuminant 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.140
 In fact, this part is still full of play. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.160
 You can use the tools you have at hand. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.660
 For example, like a flashlight. 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.080
 Or like this laser light pen 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.220
 Of course, there is also the flash of our best mobile phone. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.810
 Then if you want your light and shadow graffiti 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.240
 Can be more special 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.460
 You can also download like this 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.480
 Special mobile phone screen program 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.880
 It can have a variety of color changes 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.500
 This will make your light and shadow graffiti more vivid and moving. 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 Black and black is better 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.720
 we... 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.350
 Is it that...? 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.460
 that... 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.360
 What do you want? 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.990
 I think it is better to turn off the lights. 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.080
 Turn off the lights better! ? 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 Then, can we turn off the lights? 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.230
 Then why do you say that turning off the lights is good? 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.840
 In fact, it is mainly because the main character of our light and shadow graffiti is the light beam. 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.780
 Then we all know that the characteristics of light are 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.990
 The darker your environment 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.480
 The more obvious it is highlighted 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.210
 Just like what you see now 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.320
 In a dark background 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.350
 Only I am the most obvious, right? 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.960
 If you want to take a photo with your light and shadow graffiti 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.760
 You can get inside the camera 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 Go and manually set up something called "slow flash" 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.120
 It can be before the shutter is about to close up. 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 Give you a flash 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140
 If you do this, you can graffiti with your light and shadow. 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.650
 Come to a big photo of love啰

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.880
 The fourth point 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.280
 Is to prepare a "stable answer" tripod 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.100
 And a manual shutter 喔! 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.190
 We already have a manual shutter 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.310
 There is still a missing stand! 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.120
 Tripod? 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.820
 There are there! 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.680
 Is this ok? 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.390
 Can 哟~! 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.290
 Then, what about this? 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 This is great! 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.330
 Then... what about this? 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.960
 Ok, then let's talk about two super important tools啰

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.360
 Manual shutter 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.790
 And tripod 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.970
 Let's take the simplest example. 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.500
 Suppose you want to make a light and shadow graffiti like this 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.220
 a love is here 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.510
 Then make up a slow flash 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.220
 I am here. 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.840
 Such a simple work? 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.650
 It takes at least ten seconds or more 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.650
 Not to mention some more complicated light and shadow graffiti. 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.450
 I can't run without a twenty second. 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.360
 Even sharp people can't hold the camera on their hands. 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.290
 So 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.290
 The tripod is an important auxiliary tool 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.890
 It can help us shoot 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.730
 Sharp, clear and cute light and shadow graffiti photos 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.860
 So if you want to play light and shadow graffiti 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.160
 Really remember to bring a good tripod! 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.390
 The fifth point 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.990
 It is the difference between the front and the back! 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.870
 Do you love me? 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.400
 Love~ 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400
 Do you really love me? 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.710
 Love love love! 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.330
 Then you write it to me! 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.310
 Then wait a minute. 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.630
 ...is the opposite! ! ! 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.160
 Light and shadow graffiti has two very important features that you should note. 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.760
 Directionality 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.700
 Continuity with strokes 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.300
 Light and shadow graffiti imaging effect 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.220
 It’s a bit like a mirror 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.960
 If you do it according to the way you usually get used to it, 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.140
 It will become like this 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.370
 So when you are painting 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.180
 Pay attention to the opposite 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.880
 It will have the correct imaging results! 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.820
 What about the continuity of strokes? 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.440
 It's actually a bit like the fairy stick we played when we were young. 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.260
 Is no matter how to write 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.580
 All the strokes will stick together 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.990
 Then if you want to avoid such a situation? 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.500
 You are in the middle of strokes and strokes 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.620
 Like this 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.130
 Cover the light 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.840
 Cover 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.540
 This way? 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.650
 You can avoid the situation that the scissors are constantly chaotic. 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.070
 Remember these two characteristics 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.080
 You can complete a great light and shadow graffiti喔

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.530
 Waiting for Deng~ 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.980
 Above five points 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.446
 It is a small matter to be noticed by light and shadow graffiti啰

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.310
 Hurry and learn it! 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.020
 Maybe you can make a movie later. 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.520
 Come abroad to compete 咧

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.340
 So the above is a good topic for this week. 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.160
 I am the broadcaster Wang Andi. 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.260
 We will see you next week. 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.260
 Bye!
