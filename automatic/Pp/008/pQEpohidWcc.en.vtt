sometimes<00:00:05.190> when<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.609> are<00:00:05.640> adding<00:00:05.879> two-digit

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
sometimes when we are adding two-digit

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.930 
sometimes when we are adding two-digit
numbers<00:00:06.839> together<00:00:07.160> when<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.309> add<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.639> unit's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
numbers together when we add the unit's

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.600 
numbers together when we add the unit's
together<00:00:09.120> they<00:00:10.080> add<00:00:10.320> up<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.710> make<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.040> 10<00:00:11.370> in

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
together they add up and make a 10 in

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.299 
together they add up and make a 10 in
that<00:00:12.059> case<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.870> move<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.290> 10<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
that case we have to move that 10 to the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.460 
that case we have to move that 10 to the
tens<00:00:14.549> side<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.389> then<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> add<00:00:16.350> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
tens side and then you have to add it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.779 
tens side and then you have to add it
with<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> other<00:00:16.980> terms<00:00:17.250> we<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> do

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
with the other terms we are going to do

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.849 
with the other terms we are going to do
that<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that now and you're going to see the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.029 
that now and you're going to see the
number<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> nine<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.260> three<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.949> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
number here is nine and three we are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.560 
number here is nine and three we are
going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> add<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> unit's<00:00:23.880> first<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.449> write

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to add the unit's first you write

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.790 
going to add the unit's first you write
a<00:00:24.630> minus<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> top<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.550> tens<00:00:27.800> 9

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a minus on the top here and then tens 9

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.700 
a minus on the top here and then tens 9
plus<00:00:29.310> 3<00:00:29.519> 9<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.140> mind<00:00:31.529> 10<00:00:32.369> 11<00:00:33.149> 12<00:00:33.719> 12<00:00:34.260> has

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
plus 3 9 is in your mind 10 11 12 12 has

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.959 
plus 3 9 is in your mind 10 11 12 12 has
2<00:00:35.040> units<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> 1<00:00:36.480> 10<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.770> unit's<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> write

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
2 units and 1 10 the unit's we can write

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.610 
2 units and 1 10 the unit's we can write
underneath<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.079> unit's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
underneath the unit's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.600 
underneath the unit's
so<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.980> write<00:00:41.190> 2<00:00:41.460> over<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.739> 10<00:00:44.160> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so we write 2 over here this is a 10 so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
so we write 2 over here this is a 10 so
we<00:00:44.760> cannot<00:00:45.059> write<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> under<00:00:45.930> their<00:00:46.140> units<00:00:46.559> we

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
we cannot write it under their units we

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
we cannot write it under their units we
have<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> move<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.120> tens<00:00:48.390> column<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.379> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
have to move it in the tens column so we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.520 
have to move it in the tens column so we
carry<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> above<00:00:50.660> now<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> add

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
carry it above now we are going to add

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.240 
carry it above now we are going to add
all<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.129> tens<00:00:53.370> together<00:00:53.879> two<00:00:54.690> plus<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.379> makes

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all the tens together two plus one makes

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
all the tens together two plus one makes
three<00:00:56.840> three<00:00:57.840> plus<00:00:58.649> four<00:00:59.160> makes<00:00:59.850> seven<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.320> we

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
three three plus four makes seven so we

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.649 
three three plus four makes seven so we
have<00:01:01.710> seven<00:01:02.609> tens<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.080> answer<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.650> 72<00:01:05.580> 23<00:01:06.420> at

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have seven tens the answer is 72 23 at

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.230 
have seven tens the answer is 72 23 at
49<00:01:07.590> makes<00:01:08.420> 72<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.049> question<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.619> 37<00:01:11.310> plus<00:01:11.640> 27

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
49 makes 72 the question is 37 plus 27

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
49 makes 72 the question is 37 plus 27
going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> add<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> unit's<00:01:13.560> person<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
going to add the unit's person in the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
going to add the unit's person in the
tins<00:01:15.080> seven<00:01:16.080> plus<00:01:16.320> seven<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.890> double<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> seven

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
tins seven plus seven or double of seven

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
tins seven plus seven or double of seven
is<00:01:18.240> 14<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:20.159> four<00:01:21.030> units<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.540> us<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
is 14 so we have four units with us and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.940 
is 14 so we have four units with us and
110<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.119> units<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> under<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
110 the units are going to be under the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.370 
110 the units are going to be under the
unit's<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.700> write<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> four<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.780> under<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
unit's we write the four here under the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.399 
unit's we write the four here under the
seven<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.259> be

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
seven and then this one is going to be

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
seven and then this one is going to be
carried<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> tens<00:01:32.520> side<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.450> write<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
carried to the tens side so we write the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.450 
carried to the tens side so we write the
one<00:01:33.990> over<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:36.600> tens

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
one over here and now we have three tens

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
one over here and now we have three tens
four<00:01:38.460> five<00:01:39.420> six<00:01:40.350> tens<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> answer<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.530> 64

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
four five six tens so the answer is 64

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
four five six tens so the answer is 64
28<00:01:44.159> plus<00:01:44.430> 32<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> add<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
28 plus 32 we are going to add the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
28 plus 32 we are going to add the
unit's<00:01:46.200> first<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> tens<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.430> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
unit's first and then the tens we can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.510 
unit's first and then the tens we can
also<00:01:47.729> call<00:01:48.060> them<00:01:48.240> once<00:01:48.479> eight<00:01:49.259> plus<00:01:49.740> two<00:01:49.799> makes

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
also call them once eight plus two makes

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.899 
also call them once eight plus two makes
10<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.200> zero<00:01:52.470> comes<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> 10<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
10 so the zero comes here of the 10 and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.039 
10 so the zero comes here of the 10 and
the<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.590> carry<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the one we carry and we are now going to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
the one we carry and we are now going to
add<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> tens<00:01:58.740> together<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.030> two

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
add all the tens together so we have two

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.380 
add all the tens together so we have two
and<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.930> makes<00:02:01.380> three<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.820> three<00:02:02.969> plus

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and one makes three and then three plus

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.010 
and one makes three and then three plus
three<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.869> six<00:02:04.770> thousand<00:02:05.189> three<00:02:05.509> sixty<00:02:06.509> seven

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
three is six thousand three sixty seven

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919 
three is six thousand three sixty seven
and<00:02:07.170> four<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:08.280> eleven

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and four make eleven

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.910 
and four make eleven
one<00:02:10.229> comes<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:12.000> other<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:13.620> goes

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
one comes here and the other one goes

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.979 
one comes here and the other one goes
out<00:02:14.159> there<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:15.030> eleven<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.510> goes<00:02:15.750> down

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
out there out of eleven one goes down

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.679 
out there out of eleven one goes down
one<00:02:16.200> goes<00:02:16.379> up<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.099> then<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:17.700> add<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.120> chants

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
one goes up and then we add the chants

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.319 
one goes up and then we add the chants
together<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.470> 4<00:02:20.010> plus<00:02:20.340> 1<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.670> 5<00:02:21.079> 5<00:02:22.079> plus<00:02:22.500> 4<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.159> 9

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
together so 4 plus 1 is 5 5 plus 4 is 9

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.479 
together so 4 plus 1 is 5 5 plus 4 is 9
so<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.480> answer<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.790> 91<00:02:26.790> 44<00:02:27.689> plus<00:02:27.989> 47<00:02:28.409> makes<00:02:28.769> 91

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
so the answer is 91 44 plus 47 makes 91

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.470 
so the answer is 91 44 plus 47 makes 91
53<00:02:30.329> plus<00:02:30.629> 18<00:02:31.730> you're<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.879> to<00:02:32.970> first<00:02:33.180> write

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
53 plus 18 you're going to first write

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.770 
53 plus 18 you're going to first write
the<00:02:33.780> units<00:02:34.109> and<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.379> tens<00:02:35.329> this<00:02:36.329> is<00:02:36.420> for<00:02:36.629> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the units and the tens this is for the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.229 
the units and the tens this is for the
answer<00:02:37.459> first<00:02:38.459> you're<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.909> add<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
answer first you're going to add the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.599 
answer first you're going to add the
units<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.780> unit's<00:02:40.109> we<00:02:40.349> have<00:02:40.530> 8<00:02:40.799> &amp;<00:02:41.250> 3

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
units with the unit's we have 8 &amp; 3

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.140 
units with the unit's we have 8 &amp; 3
together<00:02:41.819> which<00:02:42.540> make<00:02:42.840> 11<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.549> have<00:02:44.730> 11

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
together which make 11 so we have 11

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.990 
together which make 11 so we have 11
over<00:02:45.359> here<00:02:45.659> this<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.310> units<00:02:47.670> which

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
over here this one is the units which

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750 
over here this one is the units which
comes<00:02:48.299> as<00:02:48.510> answer<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.549> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
comes as answer and this one here is to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
comes as answer and this one here is to
be<00:02:51.030> carried<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.139> carry<00:02:52.440> edge

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
be carried so we are going to carry edge

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.940 
be carried so we are going to carry edge
towards<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.670> 10<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.629> we<00:02:55.409> write<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.799> over

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
towards this 10 here so we write it over

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.589 
towards this 10 here so we write it over
here<00:02:56.069> next<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.180> 10<00:02:57.530> 5<00:02:58.530> plus<00:02:58.980> 1<00:02:59.150> we<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.269> 6

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
here next to this 10 5 plus 1 we have 6

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.229 
here next to this 10 5 plus 1 we have 6
tens<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.530> then<00:03:02.189> one<00:03:02.400> more<00:03:02.639> on<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:03.000> line

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
tens here and then one more on this line

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.960 
tens here and then one more on this line
so<00:03:03.269> we<00:03:03.629> have<00:03:03.810> total<00:03:04.170> seven<00:03:04.859> tens<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.700> write

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
so we have total seven tens so you write

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.479 
so we have total seven tens so you write
them<00:03:06.180> here<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.599> your<00:03:06.780> answer<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
them here as your answer so on the

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.670 
them here as your answer so on the
unit's<00:03:08.819> first<00:03:10.220> if<00:03:11.220> 11<00:03:11.819> one<00:03:12.750> goes<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:13.439> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
unit's first if 11 one goes up there and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740 
unit's first if 11 one goes up there and
then<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.579> have<00:03:14.609> seven<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.660> answer

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
then we have seven here to answer

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.689 
then we have seven here to answer
remains<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.440> same<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.799> both<00:03:16.980> ways<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.519> this

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
remains the same in both ways in this

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.420 
remains the same in both ways in this
question<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.389> are<00:03:18.419> adding<00:03:18.840> two<00:03:19.620> two-digit

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
question we are adding two two-digit

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.089 
question we are adding two two-digit
numbers<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.870> answer<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.889> have

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
numbers but the answer is going to have

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.460 
numbers but the answer is going to have
three<00:03:23.579> digits<00:03:24.000> because<00:03:24.389> we<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> hundred<00:03:25.260> in

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
three digits because we get a hundred in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.960 
three digits because we get a hundred in
the<00:03:25.620> end<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:25.889> going<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.129> show<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.310> how<00:03:26.639> we<00:03:26.699> do

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
the end I'm going to show you how we do

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.319 
the end I'm going to show you how we do
it

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
it

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.379 
it
the<00:03:27.750> question<00:03:28.169> is<00:03:28.290> 79<00:03:28.859> plus<00:03:29.220> 53<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:30.150> are<00:03:30.239> going

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
the question is 79 plus 53 we are going

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.319 
the question is 79 plus 53 we are going
to<00:03:30.510> add<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.049> unit's<00:03:31.440> first<00:03:31.879> nine<00:03:32.879> plus<00:03:33.269> three

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
to add the unit's first nine plus three

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.610 
to add the unit's first nine plus three
makes<00:03:34.049> 12<00:03:34.819> so<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.060> true<00:03:36.269> comes<00:03:36.569> down<00:03:36.870> here<00:03:37.409> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
makes 12 so the true comes down here and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.839 
makes 12 so the true comes down here and
the<00:03:37.980> one<00:03:38.190> goes<00:03:38.430> up<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:39.540> carry<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:40.019> here<00:03:40.349> and

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
the one goes up we carry it here and

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.270 
the one goes up we carry it here and
then<00:03:41.849> we<00:03:41.879> add<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.569> tens<00:03:42.780> together<00:03:43.280> seven

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
then we add all the tens together seven

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.300 
then we add all the tens together seven
plus<00:03:44.549> one<00:03:44.879> makes<00:03:45.239> eight<00:03:45.629> eight<00:03:46.349> plus<00:03:46.829> five

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
plus one makes eight eight plus five

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.409 
plus one makes eight eight plus five
makes<00:03:47.729> 13<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.739> three<00:03:50.129> here<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.699> then<00:03:51.269> we

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
makes 13 we have three here and then we

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.559 
makes 13 we have three here and then we
add<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.810> 1<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:53.129> write<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.519> 1<00:03:53.699> straightforward

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
add the 1 we write the 1 straightforward

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.990 
add the 1 we write the 1 straightforward
here<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.290> there<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.560> no<00:03:55.680> hundred<00:03:56.519> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
here because there is no hundred to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.479 
here because there is no hundred to
carry<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.199> to<00:03:58.500> otherwise<00:03:59.010> we<00:03:59.280> would<00:03:59.459> have

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
carry it to otherwise we would have

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.809 
carry it to otherwise we would have
carried<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.269> one<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.500> next<00:04:01.769> 100<00:04:02.579> but

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
carried this one to the next 100 but

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.300 
carried this one to the next 100 but
there<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.060> no<00:04:03.180> 100<00:04:03.569> near<00:04:03.750> zero<00:04:04.139> hundreds<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.190> we

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
there is no 100 near zero hundreds so we

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.069 
there is no 100 near zero hundreds so we
write<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.729> 100<00:04:06.120> here<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.930> answer<00:04:07.229> is<00:04:07.909> 132<00:04:09.079> we

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
write the 100 here the answer is 132 we

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.830 
write the 100 here the answer is 132 we
add<00:04:10.199> the<00:04:10.409> unit's<00:04:10.769> first<00:04:11.129> double<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> eight<00:04:12.419> is

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
add the unit's first double of eight is

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.250 
add the unit's first double of eight is
16<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:14.099> we<00:04:14.129> write<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.699> six

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
16 so we write the six

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.490 
16 so we write the six
of<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.709> 16<00:04:16.160> this<00:04:16.669> is<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.970> units<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.260> carry

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
of the 16 this is a units and you carry

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.640 
of the 16 this is a units and you carry
the<00:04:18.769> tens<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> top<00:04:20.109> we<00:04:21.109> add<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.440> tens

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
the tens on the top we add the tens

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.270 
the tens on the top we add the tens
together<00:04:22.100> six<00:04:22.699> plus<00:04:22.970> one<00:04:23.000> makes<00:04:23.720> seven<00:04:24.500> seven

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
together six plus one makes seven seven

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.780 
together six plus one makes seven seven
plus<00:04:25.520> three<00:04:25.550> makes<00:04:26.030> ten<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:27.320> we<00:04:27.470> write<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:28.070> over

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
plus three makes ten so we write in over

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.260 
plus three makes ten so we write in over
here<00:04:29.199> this<00:04:30.199> one<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.550> hundred

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
here this one is the hundred

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.520 
here this one is the hundred
yeah<00:04:33.220> 106<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.669> we<00:04:34.789> write<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.000> down<00:04:35.150> here<00:04:35.570> if<00:04:36.050> we

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
yeah 106 so we write it down here if we

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.439 
yeah 106 so we write it down here if we
have<00:04:36.770> another<00:04:37.190> 100<00:04:37.430> up<00:04:37.789> there<00:04:38.030> we<00:04:38.300> are<00:04:38.360> going

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
have another 100 up there we are going

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.370 
have another 100 up there we are going
to<00:04:38.750> carry<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.919> hundred
