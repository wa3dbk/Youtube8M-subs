00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.110
 tris bongrand we are here in the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.689
 south of France in department 2 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.820
 he died in the Cevennes with my 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.890
 wife two years ago we created 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.890
 the garden with a hint of bonsai 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 in this series of videos I you 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.870
 proposes to discover the natural way 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 in bonsai the natural way this is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 that it can be summed up as it is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.960
 translate into a bonsai of a species 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.330
 given what the species is in his 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 natural environment 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.640
 this therefore requires from 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 the lover to visit these biotopes 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.110
 and watch to observe to militate 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 Caesar in the natural environment 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.839
 that's what I propose to you in this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 first part of videos 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.340
 we will go in different 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.010
 backgrounds and watch how do 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.869
 these trees that are often for the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.010
 most great masters in bonsai 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 now let's see the pine 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.229
 sylvester of the scientific name pinus 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.140
 sylvestris for that we go 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.210
 mainly study an example 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 absolutely beautiful Scots pine 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.390
 in the Cevennes 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 we are here at 500 meters altitude 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 in the Cevennes I brought you here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.260
 today to show you a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 beautiful subject of Scots pines this 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.690
 tree there is particularly 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.730
 impressive of naturalness and beauty 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.770
 unfortunately he died this summer 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.270
 nevertheless we can clearly see its 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.040
 beautiful construction and sarah 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810
 ramifications that can be an example 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.690
 really to follow in the natural way 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.120
 in bonsai 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.250
 here is our old Scots pine see 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.830
 how much the branching is fine and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.490
 delicate what is typical of the pine 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170
 sylvan 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
 unlike pines with hooks that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.150
 a much more masculine construction 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.129
 a lot rougher here you have 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.170
 the whole of the cim that tells us 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.519
 exactly how to build the sign 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.549
 a Scots pine in banzai 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.709
 you have a branch that is shrinking 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.680
 gradually up on 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 which are shits and marc 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.069
 a few small successive branches 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.799
 who will build the whole of the 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.290
 foliar mass of the asim 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.660
 here is another view of the sign of our 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.250
 Scots pine 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.430
 we can see here that the asim is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.220
 consisting of several branches which 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.960
 gradually going towards the euro 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.280
 decreasing diameter and is divided by 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.010
 several small secondary branches 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.720
 tertiary ternary case so that wants 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.850
 say that the whole sinne of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.620
 passive is it is not manufactured with 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.750
 a single branch that we fold it is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.030
 well made up of several branches that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.450
 go up in search of the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.430
 light 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.120
 we can find exactly this kind of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.010
 construction also on hardwoods the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.990
 south and left ie the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.870
 full sun arrives on the left we see 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.870
 very well on this big branch the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.060
 way the tree came to get the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.650
 maximum of sun and allow 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.580
 all the shoots to recover 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.960
 the sun's energy to cause the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 photosynthesis that will allow art 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.490
 to create his elaborate sap let's not forget 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 that the asvel on board and will allow to 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.010
 create the new roots the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.330
 new branches it's from 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.190
 this elaborate scene that the tree lives 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.870
 it's the steak of the tree we can say 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.000
 and we can see that this branch 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.780
 is south side is stratified by layers 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.030
 clear 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.910
 you have down a long branch 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.010
 after a little branch over and 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.450
 successively a series of branch that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.340
 come on top of each other 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.140
 and here we have an example of a branch 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.910
 absolutely beautiful going back 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.850
 slightly upwards which very 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.140
 naturally a slight movement we see 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.270
 although the movements of Scots pine 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.740
 are not violent movement but 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.870
 small, light and airy movements 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.520
 on the other hand on the north side the branches 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.930
 do not need this laminate of the 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.270
 same way since the light is 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.980
 much more diffuse 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.380
 despite everything we can see that there 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.359
 has no small branches below 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 the tree shorter than the big ones 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.650
 bottom branches otherwise it would not take 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.630
 not the sun and so they are true 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.220
 automatically to die elsewhere here 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.960
 we see a very nice dead wood that 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.690
 were certainly a branch that did 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.890
 could not get the opportunity to have 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.650
 sun whose who is dead 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.350
 so that means that in bonsai if you 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.820
 make a Scots pine 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.919
 you must have 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.470
 branches that opt who are accessing the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.150
 light all that means that there is no 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.350
 of branches on the lower part more 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.560
 short that the branches that are at 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.560
 above 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.889
 in the natural way what we 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.159
 inspire the masters are the trees 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.639
 because only they tell us what they have 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.690
 need 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.759
 only they know how it works 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.659
 if we know how to listen to them hear this 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.639
 they have to say 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:09.460
 we can then work them in 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.530
 the spirit of their operation in 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.870
 correspondence with what they are their 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.620
 own nature and so we discover 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.099
 our deep personal nature here's 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.270
 again a loincloth salzmann and we see here 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.560
 the tabular effect that is to say that 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.680
 the whole leaf mass is going 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.819
 recover maximum heat 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.930
 obviously if we made a bonsai we 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.360
 can very well imagine that we 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.860
 would keep that left branch 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.400
 this one in order to create more dynamics 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.400
 in the tree
