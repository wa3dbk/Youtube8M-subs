00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.450
 yes I am contested from the first one 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.400
 until the last minute without any 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.029
 chance of values quite necessary a goal 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.099
 to achieve 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.480
 whether the thunder is not fair 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.710
 where is not what give me up totally 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.550
 The forecourt apologies 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 introduce 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.539
 The Ingolstadt have us totally 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.430
 dominated by everything, always pulled 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.350
 has been me no options 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.210
 have to thank us at andi luthe because 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.470
 to protrude form here the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.489
 result still reasonably bearable 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.800
 designed 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.790
 the sad day for us great 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.230
 performance from the touch worse 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
 performance from the entire team and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.930
 good would that today a real 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.210
 become debacle 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.299
 we have no form of resistance 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.530
 why I do not know me 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.290
 unimaginable as we occurred today 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.370
 are and you could only minutes I 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.900
 After twelve minutes they had faith 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.909
 five big chances of it had the four 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.769
 held or the fifth was I think 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.940
 then in there 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.580
 In the end, we can really still 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.680
 thank you for not having it 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.820
 become clear very much higher 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 badly played very bad game 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.200
 have made 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.280
 I heard he's the ball of sunny 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.080
 was inside first half but 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.540
 Nevertheless, we are really lucky that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.960
 We end up with a return receipt 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.490
 go to the break and think we have 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.320
 earned 3 0 lost 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.340
 Of course we are all frustrated and 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.570
 that was just too little yes that was that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:39.020
 was an incredible game ingolstadt 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:42.260
 very aggressive and always come to the good 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.900
 possibilities but not so great 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.119
 played great or we are wise too 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.580
 mistakes made so only with simple 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.509
 long balls and then with second balls 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.550
 or so always comes to the conclusion and on 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.119
 the same money and few possibilities 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.830
 Nevertheless , that's what happened, that's me 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.009
 not so good we do not have it 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.759
 understood the game structure too 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.560
 prevent 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.780
 We have already said that we are one 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.810
 drop a bit and then off the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.989
 midline attack but too late 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.340
 because not attack ingolstadt 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.020
 could relatively free the ball in front 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 play in and then have a lot 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.489
 fast players who brutally pursue 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.570
 and so it was relatively easy for that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.550
 the boys kinda great 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.380
 team really fast single-minded 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.590
 absolutely once we have many things wrong 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.590
 made
