00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
all right so I'll give a quick tutorial

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.190 
all right so I'll give a quick tutorial
of<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.419> bike

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
of my bike

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.639 
of my bike
some<00:00:04.650> people<00:00:04.920> been<00:00:05.069> asking<00:00:06.230> I'll<00:00:07.230> start<00:00:07.560> at

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
some people been asking I'll start at

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.190 
some people been asking I'll start at
the<00:00:07.770> back<00:00:08.630> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:11.250> 48<00:00:12.240> volt<00:00:12.509> motor<00:00:12.840> that

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the back this is the 48 volt motor that

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.800 
the back this is the 48 volt motor that
I<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.969> from<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.330> power<00:00:15.630> online<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:18.029> wish<00:00:18.660> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I got from the power online I wish I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
I got from the power online I wish I
would<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:18.990> gotten<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:20.070> powerful<00:00:20.220> one

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
would have gotten a more powerful one

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779 
would have gotten a more powerful one
but<00:00:21.740> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> ended<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.550> getting

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
but this is what I ended up getting

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.769 
but this is what I ended up getting
because<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:24.779> original<00:00:25.140> setup<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.590> 48<00:00:26.010> volts

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
because I my original setup was 48 volts

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
because I my original setup was 48 volts
putting<00:00:27.779> 72<00:00:28.289> volts<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.010> these<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
putting 72 volts to it now these are the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.690 
putting 72 volts to it now these are the
custom<00:00:30.869> torque<00:00:31.140> arms<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
custom torque arms I put on just with a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.799 
custom torque arms I put on just with a
hose<00:00:33.690> clamp<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.440> an<00:00:34.559> L<00:00:34.710> bracket<00:00:35.809> they're

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
hose clamp and an L bracket they're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.619 
hose clamp and an L bracket they're
essential<00:00:38.420> that's<00:00:39.420> basically<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.469> onto<00:00:41.629> the

go for a long ride and test it out show
you<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> speeds<00:02:33.769> see<00:02:34.769> if<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.099> do<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.280> with

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
you the speeds see if I can do this with

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:44.940 
you the speeds see if I can do this with
one<00:02:35.610> hand

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.740 

it<00:02:45.459> gets<00:02:45.700> up<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:47.760> 65<00:02:48.760> kilometers<00:02:49.510> an<00:02:49.629> hour

it gets up to 65 kilometers an hour
pretty<00:02:50.290> quick<00:02:50.849> on<00:02:51.849> flat<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:55.540> it'll<00:02:55.780> go<00:02:55.989> out

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
pretty quick on flat then it'll go out

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.600 
pretty quick on flat then it'll go out
70<00:02:58.060> K<00:02:58.300> on<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:59.069> slight<00:03:00.069> downhill<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:03.370> pretty

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
70 K on a slight downhill it's pretty

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:22.270 
70 K on a slight downhill it's pretty
much<00:03:03.760> all<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.090> need<00:03:04.239> for<00:03:04.540> city<00:03:04.959> riding

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.970 

so<00:03:23.280> full<00:03:23.640> throttle<00:03:24.120> now

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.190 

for<00:03:29.370> it
