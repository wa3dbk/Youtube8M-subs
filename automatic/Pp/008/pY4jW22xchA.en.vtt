 I tell you very much and that all 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.320
 I tell you, but you do it to me 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.029
 so happy when you comment one of my 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.759
 videos you share with your friends 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.290
 and I have shared as well they do to me 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.140
 happy because I feel 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.000
 mastercard and that is that I confess that 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.950
 I would love to know you I do not know maybe in 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 a future because I would like to stay with 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.870
 those who are from Madrid or Spain and 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.820
 come to madrid or something like that I would like 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.010
 because I know that a lot of people are from 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.390
 latin america 'to say it always well is 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.310
 a lot in you because it's very 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.040
 strong that from there from that part of the 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.900
 world main stage bid fomín and is 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.910
 impressive but I know that that's very 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.910
 difficult at the moment I do not plan and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.250
 there but I wish I could meet you 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 each and every one of you so I 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 I will try to do something so that we 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.650
 let's know, it's worth it down here if you 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 I made a hangout because it would come and if 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.489
 that's because I would be very excited 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.439
 know them all but good here is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.960
 now is the video today's video is a 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.740
 updated version of the get ready with 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.689
 me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.240
 version seems like I already did it like 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.220
 a year two I'll leave it here below 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 the super mother and really served me not 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.460
 I'm not proud but I'm good 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 intention to renew all the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.130
 old videos to one let's say version 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.289
 current and better because many times it is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.020
 I is really for example that 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.820
 I carry in my bag is that I do not wear it 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.799
 more or less similar other I take things 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 quite different so if you want 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.399
 to make you some video to have them 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.689
 with better quality and better content 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.460
 nobody press it down on me and in the video 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.039
 today we are going to prepare because I have 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.509
 fossil jazz class radio school 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.190
 original 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.049
 let's say it will not be all right because 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.209
 you know that I love dance in general 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.850
 ballet in particular but I love the 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.649
 I love jazz and I love my teacher and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.750
 I love her class and then for me 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.000
 you have to fix so you can see what we say 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.459
 the wardrobe is different this one also 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.740
 you see why a soil let's say no 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.980
 make up but it's not as good as it is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.990
 so classic, I try to have 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.820
 style that I also want to make soon 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.850
 an updated version of the center 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.460
 wifi is ok and in the end I will try 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.990
 record in the class I do not know can I promise 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.390
 but I swear to you that as I have a 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.730
 minimum opportunity I will record the class 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.980
 of copito so you can see a bit of the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.300
 choreography and what we do in class 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 that I have no idea what we're going to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.900
 do let's see it and weapons 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.780
 I leave you with the preparation process 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 and see you here next Friday, no 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.300
 I love you many girls in video 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.890
 hello guys first of all I always carry 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.690
 thousands of forward in the bag very 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.820
 important and I usually apply makeup 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.740
 but very little and I always wear a 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.090
 headband to not stain my hair what 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.650
 first thing that I wear is the basis of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.990
 makeup in mousse that those old 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.610
 of the club and great to dance the 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.530
 next is a bit of bronze you're from 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 h &amp; m super cheap and it goes great 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.430
 then I like to put some shade 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.610
 in the eyes with the palette nor that three 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.200
 such pinkish tones and the cuckoo of the eye 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.910
 a little more brown is not something super 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.910
 simple but a little different since 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.130
 already if it's not so ballet mascara this one 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.810
 it's also waterproof is from essence and I 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.700
 I love you I recommend it for those who 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.440
 dances and as you can see is a makeup 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 super simple 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.300
 now we go with the hair I usually do 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.490
 what is said a bun disheveled but 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.440
 at the purest level because it is not so 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.170
 classic is not so rigid and then I 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.210
 like to go more daring let's say I loose 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.550
 some strands and nothing super something 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.040
 to report the more informal because more 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.700
 like 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.230
 and we're going to change clothes first 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.230
 I always put my days because I want 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.939
 that uses a lot the figure a greater in 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.310
 this case chosen this green but I have 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.319
 very many as you know and I think that 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.180
 feel super good 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.859
 after little pants pants 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.659
 short depends on the day but I like 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.549
 much these are like that and wide and 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.430
 long I think they look very good and very 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.019
 comfortable to dance and I do not know the truth 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.780
 that I'm changing jazz clothes and 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.030
 you know if you want a hall of and after 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 I put the top that is already taught and nothing 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.840
 of clothes always super simple and very 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.760
 comfortable to dance shines on mclaren 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.980
 the shoes that these are cape cello 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.099
 escrivá a long time ago and they are great 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.650
 and I dance it's super comfortable with them and 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.900
 good guys up here the jazz look 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.220
 let's say I hope you like it a lot and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.910
 let's see if we could record something 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.910
 we are leaving now 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.150
 and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 and 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.189
 my mind 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.189
 and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.490
 Y 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.210
