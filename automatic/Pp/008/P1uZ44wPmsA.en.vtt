00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.910
 why comp il is for true al players 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.710
 game consoles for zadrotov although games 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.740
 to them the same output 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.860
 I think the system is blamed here. 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 and trophies if package nick pass the game 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.050
 and forget that all these achivas make 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.410
 hundreds of times repeating the same 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.570
 meaningless actions that is 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.460
 zadrachivat game but somehow in the world 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.090
 consoles all these achivy and trophy appreciated 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.010
 so much so that comes to insanity in one 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.760
 from my videos I showed how to copy 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.200
 playstation 3 saved to USB flash drive 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.990
 it turned out that not every game 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.880
 allows me to do this I counted as 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.760
 minimum dark souls feb 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.460
 dragon ball z and 2 march kill zone 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.410
 street fighter ii motorstorm when trying 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.750
 rewrite the saves of these games 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.030
 only cloud storage appears and 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.400
 it even gives an error that they are protected from 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.520
 copying know why you don't 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.650
 allow backing up saves to flash drive 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.929
 so you God forbid do not give this flash drive 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.729
 to a friend and he somehow not 

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:10.789
 got your trophies 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.920
 that is, avoided zadrotstva however 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.750
 owners of custom consoles can 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.850
 rewrite saves immediacy 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.390
 file system through multiman or by 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.479
 ftp 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.299
 find yourself where and how but what to do 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.759
 holders of official sony firmware 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.859
 offers you two ways one webb 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.499
 carry and go to other settings 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.560
 system and look for there item utility 

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:36.170
 data transfer description says that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.369
 even protected from 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
 copy data 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.109
 that 's all that's meant for 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.319
 moving from one console to another and 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.659
 carried via ethernet cable 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.639
 second option backup utility 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.069
 copying it makes a full backup 

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:52.850
 your saves including protected 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.859
 from copying 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.289
 so you can be calm for their 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.179
 safekeeping to transfer them back to 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.299
 prefix use recovery 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.340
 from the same utility on the computer 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.229
 see this backup will not work 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229
 because it is encrypted
