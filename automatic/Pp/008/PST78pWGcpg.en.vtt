00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 It is Akio Akima of Dharma Meima 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.200
 Positive grid bias 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.930
 this 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.840
 As an guitar builder as an amp builder 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.840
 I want to check thoroughly 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:45.879
 I think this kind of vacuum tube is clean for cats 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.870
 That kind of slightly distorted one should sound clean when various instruments come in 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.760
 In 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.760
 hey hey 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.630
 eaa 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:05.519
 That kind of feeling of the American like you want is quite amazing 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:09.210
 When I listen to this waterfall, I feel like I'm a bit sick 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.840
 If you mix in the buns, you probably have a sense of presence at all 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840
 Well 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 Ha 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890
 Interesting 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.820
 Oh wow you're out there 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.820
 A crunch hall that's a little too good 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.689
 It feels like a post off 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 me 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.569
 Yeah yeah 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:19.139
 The harmonics change at all, but I'm going to take a little coating here at the tournament 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:22.760
 If you take a picture here in 57, it's a little more than it actually is 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.640
 Things like edges are diff deformed a little 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.860
 8 pieces of clothes just for cats 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.560
 Just between the center cap in the middle and that 9 gold 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.340
 Nde always yourself is taking in pretty sound here 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.849
 That's not right 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.849
 Yes me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.400
 How can I see this ? 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.209
 U 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.209
 Wow 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.319
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.340
 Ha 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.170
 Oh I like to think this kind of sound A little bit 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.080
 It's almost time, so why not 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.690
 I feel that the second degree is not strong 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.550
 If I say in fender, it's more of one control 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:27.940
 Like a vintage champ 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:33.420
 But I Champ've got to or got pretty collapsed a little in fact and to distort this is 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 I think I can do well if I take only that kind of thing 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.450
 Or rather single way 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.380
 car 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.380
 ni 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.380
 par 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.000
 car 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.380
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.730
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.980
 What a great this is that 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:04.480
 It's like this, but it looks like a box, especially when it's the old guy's red panel 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.480
 At that time my sister 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.870
 Transformer Output Transformer 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.870
 Sound is pretty 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:20.500
 It is different every age, but just school 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:22.330
 That range is not very wide, but it seems like a sound can be heard, and it's a way to go. 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.510
 That's why 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.600
 Oh I wish Teru In that feeling 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.600
 a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:37.849
 No, this is a good sound at all 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.849
 Well I see, you see, this is 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.800
 Because you can increase the vacuum tube of reamp 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.409
 In that I now 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:58.310
 Preamplifier is a high vacuum tube is high 3 It has become a guy called stage this original guy 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:01.060
 So let's try to do this one more step 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.060
 par 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.690
 too 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.460
 Back to one more 33 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.290
 If this is chosen- 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.770
 I think you have increased uhh uhh Uh-uh amazing distortion 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.870
 Miuka say so Well cabinet also little wrote 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.870
 From cabinet sunshine of this 4 shot put 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:42.459
 This kind of me something a Ola 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:46.310
 Distorted firmly that way But I'm the guy that not a heavy metal of the amplifier 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:47.980
 It has It is Enoi above world Tteyuu 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.350
 Ha 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.350
 I wonder what a cat sounds like a good cat 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:06.080
 This bias is fun to make an amp 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:10.750
 And it's fun to pull it down there really is endless possibilities 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.750
 I think it is a great invincible item 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:21.270
 I do not like it 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.270
 I'm've been thought that I do not want to say that 9 you do not say things like that
