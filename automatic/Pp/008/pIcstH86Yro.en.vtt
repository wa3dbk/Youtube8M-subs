up since I didn't have any tattooed
eyebrows<00:05:59.419> I<00:05:59.749> decided<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.560> paint<00:06:00.860> them<00:06:01.039> on

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.790 
eyebrows I decided to paint them on
again<00:06:01.330> where<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.659> original<00:06:02.840> eyebrows<00:06:03.469> are

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
again where the original eyebrows are

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.580

and put some makeup on just to see how
it'll<00:06:06.979> look<00:06:07.300> because<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:09.319> last<00:06:09.529> time<00:06:09.770> I<00:06:09.800> did

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
way they are and this makes me consider

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.760
