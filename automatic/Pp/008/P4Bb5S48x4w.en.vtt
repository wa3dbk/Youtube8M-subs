00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.810 
mostly from a position of strength which

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.870 
mostly from a position of strength which
is<00:00:04.930> Lake<00:00:05.110> position<00:00:05.529> now<00:00:06.100> there's<00:00:06.580> a<00:00:06.670> thing

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
is Lake position now there's a thing

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.060 
is Lake position now there's a thing
called<00:00:06.910> three<00:00:07.720> barreling<00:00:08.170> I<00:00:08.349> guess<00:00:08.710> all<00:00:08.920> the

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
called three barreling I guess all the

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.410 
called three barreling I guess all the
new<00:00:09.309> kids<00:00:09.580> are<00:00:09.880> coming<00:00:10.000> out<00:00:10.240> with<00:00:10.269> new

new kids are coming out with new
terminology<00:00:11.200> and<00:00:11.290> and<00:00:11.440> they<00:00:11.800> call<00:00:12.010> it<00:00:12.099> three

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
terminology and and they call it three

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.250 
terminology and and they call it three
barreling<00:00:12.610> so<00:00:12.820> I'll<00:00:13.090> go<00:00:13.300> with<00:00:13.450> that<00:00:13.480> what

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
barreling so I'll go with that what

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.930 
barreling so I'll go with that what
three<00:00:14.500> barreling<00:00:14.980> basically<00:00:15.490> means<00:00:15.670> is

beds1<00:00:18.550> on<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.820> flop<00:00:19.000> one<00:00:19.420> of<00:00:19.510> the<00:00:19.600> turn<00:00:19.779> and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
beds1 on the flop one of the turn and

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.810 
beds1 on the flop one of the turn and
then<00:00:20.440> one<00:00:20.740> on<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:20.920> river<00:00:21.100> as<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.369> complete

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
then one on the river as a complete

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.090 
then one on the river as a complete
bluff<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.900> play<00:00:23.080> that's<00:00:23.230> really<00:00:23.890> rarely

done<00:00:24.369> for<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.850> most<00:00:25.060> part<00:00:25.300> if<00:00:25.539> poker<00:00:26.109> players

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
done for the most part if poker players

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.980 
done for the most part if poker players
bet<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.619> flop<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.070> a<00:00:27.130> bluff<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.150> call<00:00:28.390> now

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
bet the flop on a bluff and you call now

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.330 
bet the flop on a bluff and you call now
they<00:00:29.199> bet<00:00:29.320> the<00:00:29.350> turn<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:29.769> you<00:00:29.859> call<00:00:30.039> again

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
they bet the turn and you call again

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.040 
they bet the turn and you call again
they'll<00:00:30.880> usually<00:00:31.180> give<00:00:31.539> up<00:00:31.660> on<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.900> river

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
they'll usually give up on the river

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.419 
they'll usually give up on the river
assuming<00:00:32.649> that<00:00:32.769> you're<00:00:32.889> probably<00:00:33.129> going<00:00:33.370> to

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:33.429 
assuming that you're probably going to

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.849 
assuming that you're probably going to
call<00:00:33.609> that<00:00:33.639> bet<00:00:33.999> too<00:00:34.239> but<00:00:35.170> before<00:00:35.319> you<00:00:35.530> just

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:35.859 
call that bet too but before you just

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.009 
call that bet too but before you just
give<00:00:36.370> up<00:00:36.579> there<00:00:36.819> are<00:00:36.999> a<00:00:37.030> few<00:00:37.300> times<00:00:37.600> when<00:00:37.899> you'd

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
give up there are a few times when you'd

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.479 
give up there are a few times when you'd
actually<00:00:38.170> want<00:00:38.409> to<00:00:38.589> three<00:00:38.829> barrel<00:00:39.100> yourself

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
actually want to three barrel yourself

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.059 
actually want to three barrel yourself
okay<00:00:39.999> a<00:00:40.179> lot<00:00:40.629> of<00:00:40.659> it<00:00:40.839> is<00:00:40.929> psychology<00:00:41.469> based<00:00:41.920> on

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.069 
okay a lot of it is psychology based on

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.979 
okay a lot of it is psychology based on
your<00:00:42.190> opponent<00:00:42.579> maybe<00:00:43.210> your<00:00:43.389> opponent<00:00:43.749> knows

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
your opponent maybe your opponent knows

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.529 
your opponent maybe your opponent knows
that<00:00:44.499> you<00:00:44.620> don't<00:00:44.769> fire<00:00:44.979> three<00:00:45.249> bullets<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:46.030> he

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
that you don't fire three bullets so he

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.149 
that you don't fire three bullets so he
may<00:00:46.719> be<00:00:46.780> calling<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.469> on<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.709> turn<00:00:47.920> in<00:00:48.100> a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
may be calling you on the turn in a

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.709 
may be calling you on the turn in a
situation<00:00:48.339> where<00:00:48.789> he<00:00:48.850> thinks<00:00:49.120> well<00:00:49.359> I'm

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
situation where he thinks well I'm

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.660 
situation where he thinks well I'm
calling<00:00:50.109> on<00:00:50.319> the<00:00:50.440> turn<00:00:50.620> but<00:00:50.859> if<00:00:51.100> he<00:00:51.249> bets<00:00:51.489> the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
calling on the turn but if he bets the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.219 
calling on the turn but if he bets the
river<00:00:51.819> I'm<00:00:52.089> just<00:00:52.269> going<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.510> give<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.719> up<00:00:52.839> now

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
river I'm just going to give it up now

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.199 
river I'm just going to give it up now
again<00:00:53.379> if<00:00:53.859> these<00:00:54.219> types<00:00:54.459> of<00:00:54.579> players<00:00:54.819> think

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:55.209 
again if these types of players think

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:57.389 
again if these types of players think
they<00:00:55.359> know<00:00:55.899> your<00:00:56.109> style<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.589> they<00:00:56.829> know<00:00:57.219> that

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
they know your style and they know that

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.669 
they know your style and they know that
you<00:00:57.519> only<00:00:57.639> fire<00:00:57.909> to<00:00:58.149> barrows<00:00:58.479> you<00:00:59.019> may<00:00:59.350> be<00:00:59.409> able

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
you only fire to barrows you may be able

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.169 
you only fire to barrows you may be able
to<00:00:59.889> get<00:01:00.039> away<00:01:00.129> with<00:01:00.219> fire<00:01:00.579> and<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.760> third<00:01:00.969> one

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
to get away with fire and a third one

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.809 
to get away with fire and a third one
however<00:01:01.779> the<00:01:02.260> most<00:01:02.529> important<00:01:03.190> consideration

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
however the most important consideration

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.639 
however the most important consideration
aside<00:01:04.089> from<00:01:04.239> psychology<00:01:04.809> is<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.259> board

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
aside from psychology is the board

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.649 
aside from psychology is the board
texture<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.280> what<00:01:06.789> kinds<00:01:07.149> of<00:01:07.210> cards<00:01:07.539> have

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
texture and what kinds of cards have

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.420 
texture and what kinds of cards have
come<00:01:07.810> off<00:01:07.960> okay<00:01:08.439> now<00:01:08.829> if<00:01:08.920> your<00:01:09.039> opponent<00:01:09.189> is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
come off okay now if your opponent is

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.160 
come off okay now if your opponent is
check<00:01:09.729> calling<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> flop<00:01:10.539> of<00:01:10.570> King<00:01:11.079> a

straight draw now you have to ask

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.060 
straight draw now you have to ask
yourself<00:01:16.630> what<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.500> world<00:01:17.679> is<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.920> guy

betting the river against average to
weaker<00:01:25.780> players<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.200> usually<00:01:26.560> futile<00:01:26.979> because

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
weaker players is usually futile because

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.740 
weaker players is usually futile because
they're<00:01:27.729> going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.909> call<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.450> that's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
they're going to call you and that's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.959 
they're going to call you and that's
where<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.109> want<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.859> give<00:01:29.979> up<00:01:30.100> really<00:01:30.429> now

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
where you want to give up really now

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.849 
where you want to give up really now
against<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.659> really<00:01:31.929> good<00:01:32.079> thinking<00:01:32.679> player

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
able to make a big bit on the river and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940 
able to make a big bit on the river and
get<00:01:37.179> him<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.329> fold<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.780> king<00:01:37.960> because<00:01:38.200> looks

get him to fold a king because looks

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.620 
get him to fold a king because looks
like<00:01:39.159> that's<00:01:39.609> what<00:01:39.820> he's<00:01:39.909> got<00:01:40.090> at<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.359> point

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
like that's what he's got at this point

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.510 
like that's what he's got at this point
you<00:01:41.289> know<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.469> would<00:01:41.649> think<00:01:41.679> he<00:01:42.070> has<00:01:42.189> at<00:01:42.369> least

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
you know you would think he has at least

you know you would think he has at least
a<00:01:42.729> pair<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.969> eights<00:01:43.119> but<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.659> way<00:01:43.780> he's

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
a pair of eights but the way he's

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.270 
a pair of eights but the way he's
playing<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.259> hand<00:01:44.439> he's<00:01:44.710> certainly<00:01:45.130> not

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
playing the hand he's certainly not

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.249 
playing the hand he's certainly not
drawing<00:01:45.609> so<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.210> those<00:01:46.390> situations<00:01:47.049> when<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
drawing so in those situations when the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.260 
drawing so in those situations when the
flop<00:01:47.469> comes<00:01:47.679> like<00:01:47.920> King<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.219> deuce<00:01:48.460> you<00:01:49.119> don't

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
flop comes like King a deuce you don't

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.819 
flop comes like King a deuce you don't
need<00:01:49.359> to<00:01:49.479> fire<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.899> second<00:01:50.200> girl<00:01:50.259> too<00:01:50.530> often

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
position you might want to just check it

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.130

down and if you have any sort of a head
you<00:01:56.319> might<00:01:56.649> want<00:01:56.799> to<00:01:56.889> try<00:01:57.009> one<00:01:57.100> more<00:01:57.520> barrel

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
you might want to try one more barrel

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
say do this every time because you

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.450 
say do this every time because you
really<00:02:04.509> don't<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.749> become<00:02:04.929> predictable

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
really don't to become predictable

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.379 
really don't to become predictable
everything<00:02:06.460> should<00:02:06.639> be<00:02:06.670> read<00:02:06.939> dependent

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
everything should be read dependent

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:09.449

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
everything should be based on how your

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.460 
everything should be based on how your
opponent<00:02:09.580> perceives<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.780> if<00:02:11.019> your

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
opponent perceives you so if your

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.800 
opponent perceives you so if your
opponent<00:02:11.680> thinks<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.640> firing<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> second

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
opponent thinks that you firing a second

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.130 
opponent thinks that you firing a second
barrel

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
barrel

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.990 
barrel
you<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:15.190> go<00:02:15.460> ahead<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.880> it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you have it then go ahead and do it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.090 
you have it then go ahead and do it
sometimes<00:02:16.420> don't<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.140> all<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> time<00:02:17.500> then

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
sometimes don't do it all the time then

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.920 
sometimes don't do it all the time then
again<00:02:18.220> sometimes<00:02:18.819> if<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.360> think<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.690> third

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
again sometimes if you think the third

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420 
again sometimes if you think the third
rail<00:02:20.200> might<00:02:20.380> work<00:02:20.590> because<00:02:20.890> your<00:02:21.010> opponent<00:02:21.370> is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
rail might work because your opponent is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.770 
rail might work because your opponent is
going<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.670> give<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.300> know<00:02:22.390> give<00:02:22.569> up<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
going to give you you know give up a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to give you you know give up a
pair<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.050> kings<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.380> go<00:02:23.500> ahead<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.860> that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
pair of kings and go ahead and do that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.530 
pair of kings and go ahead and do that
too<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.520> let's<00:02:24.670> look<00:02:24.819> at<00:02:24.940> other<00:02:25.120> types<00:02:25.420> of

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
too but let's look at other types of

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.180 
too but let's look at other types of
flops<00:02:25.780> where<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.470> should<00:02:26.620> maybe<00:02:26.800> fire<00:02:27.160> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
flops where you should maybe fire a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.770 
flops where you should maybe fire a
third<00:02:27.520> barrel<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.030> your<00:02:28.330> bed<00:02:28.480> wouldn't

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
third barrel and your bed wouldn't

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.990 
third barrel and your bed wouldn't
necessarily<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.740> big<00:02:29.950> when<00:02:30.880> you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
necessarily have to be that big when you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.360 
necessarily have to be that big when you
have<00:02:31.240> boards<00:02:31.959> with<00:02:32.110> drawers<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.709> them<00:02:32.860> these

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
have boards with drawers on them these

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 
have boards with drawers on them these
are<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.610> kinds<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.000> hands<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.420> even<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:35.110> you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
are the kinds of hands that even if you

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320 
are the kinds of hands that even if you
were<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.709> draw<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.640> might<00:02:36.850> want<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.150> fire

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
were on a draw you might want to fire

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.760 
were on a draw you might want to fire
barrels<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.930> all<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.350> way<00:02:38.440> through<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
barrels that all the way through the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.280 
barrels that all the way through the
hand<00:02:38.950> let's<00:02:39.910> say<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.330> example<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.080> flop

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
hand let's say for example the flop

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.559 
hand let's say for example the flop
comes<00:02:41.470> Jack<00:02:41.860> 10<00:02:42.100> 4<00:02:42.400> with<00:02:42.580> two<00:02:42.610> hearts<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
comes Jack 10 4 with two hearts and you

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.690 
comes Jack 10 4 with two hearts and you
find<00:02:43.900> yourself<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.319> there<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:44.680> 89<00:02:45.250> your

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
find yourself in there with 89 your

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.310 
find yourself in there with 89 your
opponent<00:02:46.030> checks<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.690> raise<00:02:46.900> before<00:02:47.080> the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
opponent checks and you raise before the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
you have nine high after all so this is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080 
you have nine high after all so this is

situation where three barreling might
not<00:03:25.299> be<00:03:25.450> terrible<00:03:25.840> but<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.380> to<00:03:26.590> know

a jack or a ten to you because he's

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.110 
a jack or a ten to you because he's
scared<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> assume<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.910> there's<00:03:34.060> a

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
scared you have to assume that there's a

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000 
scared you have to assume that there's a
decent<00:03:34.450> possibility<00:03:35.200> he's<00:03:35.350> drawing<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.829> well

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
decent possibility he's drawing as well

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.100 
decent possibility he's drawing as well
now<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:37.060> bet<00:03:37.239> size<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:37.840> situation

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
now the bet size in this situation

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.140 
now the bet size in this situation
doesn't<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.070> be<00:03:39.160> monstrous<00:03:39.700> because<00:03:40.000> if

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
doesn't have to be monstrous because if

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.819 
doesn't have to be monstrous because if
your<00:03:40.510> opponent<00:03:40.660> has<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.019> drawing<00:03:41.350> type<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.680> hand

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829

whereas if he has the jack or the 10 and
he<00:03:45.670> decides<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.209> it's<00:03:46.329> good<00:03:46.510> he's<00:03:47.079> probably

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
he decides it it's good he's probably

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.650 
he decides it it's good he's probably
going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.560> call<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> larger<00:03:48.160> bed<00:03:48.310> anyway<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.269> in

this situation what you should bet is an

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.009 
this situation what you should bet is an
amount<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.579> looks<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.030> value<00:03:52.390> bet<00:03:52.570> you

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
amount that looks like a value bet you

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.720 
amount that looks like a value bet you
should<00:03:53.200> bet<00:03:53.320> an<00:03:53.410> amount<00:03:53.590> that's<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.549> big

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
should bet an amount that's not so big

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.009 
should bet an amount that's not so big
that<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.000> looks<00:03:55.180> like<00:03:55.360> you're<00:03:55.570> trying<00:03:55.959> to

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
that it looks like you're trying to

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.780 
that it looks like you're trying to
scare<00:03:56.260> your<00:03:56.410> opponent<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:56.860> not<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.459> small

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
scare your opponent and not so small

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.100 
scare your opponent and not so small
that<00:03:57.820> he's<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.420> know<00:03:58.450> going<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.720> make<00:03:58.840> an<00:03:58.959> easy

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
that he's you know going to make an easy

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.660 
that he's you know going to make an easy
call<00:03:59.440> with<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.650> ten<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.220> want<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.549> make<00:04:00.610> a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
call with a ten you want to make a

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.729 
call with a ten you want to make a
decent<00:04:01.000> size<00:04:01.360> bed<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.900> fifty<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.380> sixty

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
decent size bed of fifty to sixty

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.620 
decent size bed of fifty to sixty
percent<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.160> pot<00:04:03.340> value<00:04:03.940> bet<00:04:04.090> size<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.540> it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
percent of the pot value bet size so it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.690 
percent of the pot value bet size so it
looks<00:04:04.930> like<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.170> value<00:04:05.500> bet<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.890> course<00:04:06.100> so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
looks like a value bet but of course so

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.370 
looks like a value bet but of course so
that<00:04:06.850> really<00:04:07.000> your<00:04:07.239> opponent<00:04:07.660> thinks<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
that really your opponent thinks you

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.289 
that really your opponent thinks you
want<00:04:08.530> them<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> call<00:04:08.860> anything<00:04:09.850> more<00:04:10.180> than

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
want them to call anything more than

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.490 
want them to call anything more than
