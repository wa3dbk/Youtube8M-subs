would<00:00:31.109> assume<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.590> minor<00:00:31.859> update<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:33.090> Al<00:00:33.480> 30

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
would assume a minor update from Al 30

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
would assume a minor update from Al 30
even<00:00:34.920> though<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> later<00:00:35.940> date<00:00:36.210> but

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
even though it is it's a later date but

even though it is it's a later date but
anyways<00:00:37.399> aside<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.610> let's<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.030> ahead

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
anyways aside from that let's go ahead

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.690 
anyways aside from that let's go ahead
and<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.870> compare<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.680> modems<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and just compare the two modems this

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.250 
and just compare the two modems this
isn't<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:42.210> scientific<00:00:42.450> tests<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
isn't a very scientific tests but

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
isn't a very scientific tests but

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
times on FB 15 and we'll see what what

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.649 
times on FB 15 and we'll see what what
they<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.420> hopefully<00:01:34.850> FB<00:01:35.850> 15<00:01:36.299> modems

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
they look like hopefully FB 15 modems

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.100 
they look like hopefully FB 15 modems
better<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:38.369> always<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.060> terrible<00:01:39.420> 3G<00:01:39.840> speeds

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
better I'm always get terrible 3G speeds

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.399 
better I'm always get terrible 3G speeds
anyway<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.140> expect

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
anyway where I'm at so I don't expect

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.999 
anyway where I'm at so I don't expect
anything<00:01:43.740> amazing<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.030> hopefully<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.840> FB<00:01:46.560> 15

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
anything amazing but hopefully the FB 15

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.600 
anything amazing but hopefully the FB 15
modem<00:01:47.399> does<00:01:47.579> improve<00:01:48.000> things<00:01:49.220> let's<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.399> ahead

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
modem does improve things let's go ahead

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
modem does improve things let's go ahead
and<00:01:50.729> let<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.970> test<00:01:51.299> finish<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.259> once

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and let this test finish and then once

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
and let this test finish and then once
it's<00:01:52.680> done<00:01:52.890> i'm<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.399> ahead<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> run

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it's done i'm going to go ahead and run

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.709 
it's done i'm going to go ahead and run
it<00:01:54.119> three<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.689> times<00:01:55.340> as<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it three more times as you can see is

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
it three more times as you can see is
going<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.259> ahead<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> finish<00:01:58.860> come<00:01:59.610> on

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
going to go ahead and finish come on

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.359 
going to go ahead and finish come on
there<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.380> terrible<00:02:01.920> download

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369

and upload speeds point 1 3 megabits and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.760 
and upload speeds point 1 3 megabits and
download<00:02:05.939> point<00:02:06.240> 0<00:02:06.540> 3<00:02:06.840> megabits<00:02:07.229> upload<00:02:07.619> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
download point 0 3 megabits upload so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
download point 0 3 megabits upload so
that<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.039> awful<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.060> anyways<00:02:09.479> let's<00:02:09.720> go

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that was awful but anyways let's go

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.150 
that was awful but anyways let's go
ahead<00:02:10.110> I'm<00:02:10.349> gonna<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.619> ahead<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.800> run<00:02:11.009> them

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
ahead I'm gonna go ahead and run them

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
ahead I'm gonna go ahead and run them
twice<00:02:11.489> more<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.300> will

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
twice more and I will

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.800 
twice more and I will
back<00:02:13.340> alright<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.640> testing<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.480> done

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
back alright so testing is now done

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.380 
back alright so testing is now done
actually<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.560> very<00:02:16.830> interesting<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.820> I'm

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
actually it's very interesting that I'm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.930 
actually it's very interesting that I'm
getting<00:02:18.810> such<00:02:19.260> consistent<00:02:20.070> speeds<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.820> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
getting such consistent speeds as you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.180 
getting such consistent speeds as you
can<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.720> very<00:02:22.110> very<00:02:22.500> consistent

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
can see right there very very consistent

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.520 
can see right there very very consistent
with<00:02:23.370> point<00:02:24.090> 1<00:02:24.240> 3<00:02:24.510> megabits<00:02:24.900> per<00:02:25.020> second

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
with point 1 3 megabits per second

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.430 
with point 1 3 megabits per second
download<00:02:25.680> speeds<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.520> all<00:02:26.700> three<00:02:27.060> tests<00:02:27.570> point

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
download speeds on all three tests point

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.620 
download speeds on all three tests point
1<00:02:28.590> 3<00:02:28.890> megabits<00:02:29.310> per<00:02:29.430> second<00:02:29.850> upload<00:02:30.150> speeds<00:02:30.480> on

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
1 3 megabits per second upload speeds on

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.220 
1 3 megabits per second upload speeds on
two<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.020> tests<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.800> it's<00:02:32.430> very<00:02:32.640> very

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
two of the tests so it's very very

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920 
two of the tests so it's very very
consistently<00:02:34.230> awful<00:02:35.210> but<00:02:36.210> that's<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.780> i'm

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
consistently awful but that's it i'm

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.870 
consistently awful but that's it i'm
going<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.170> ahead<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.380> install<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:38.160> FB<00:02:38.460> 15

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
going to go ahead and install the FB 15

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400 
going to go ahead and install the FB 15
modem<00:02:39.180> i<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.720> video<00:02:39.900> showing<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.260> how

at the end let's go ahead and go back
into<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.140> speed<00:02:58.530> test<00:02:58.800> app<00:02:59.130> let<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> load<00:03:00.300> on

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
into the speed test app let it load on

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.150 
into the speed test app let it load on
up<00:03:00.810> again<00:03:01.710> make<00:03:01.980> sure<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:04.650> finds<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
up again make sure that it finds the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.070 
up again make sure that it finds the
same<00:03:05.430> server<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.960> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
same server and then I have all the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.150 
same server and then I have all the
settings<00:03:07.440> set<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.280> exact<00:03:08.850> same<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> let's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
settings set up the exact same so let's

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.730 
settings set up the exact same so let's
go<00:03:11.340> ahead<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.750> go<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> tools<00:03:13.110> make<00:03:13.560> sure

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
go ahead and go to tools make sure

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.310 
go ahead and go to tools make sure
aurora<00:03:14.220> megabits<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.210> better<00:03:15.660> performance

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
aurora megabits and better performance

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.100 
aurora megabits and better performance
ready<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.220> go<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.790> ahead<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.030> begin<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
ready to go so go ahead and begin the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.250 
ready to go so go ahead and begin the
test<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.860> hopefully<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.780> find<00:03:22.020> that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
test and hopefully you all find that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.500 
test and hopefully you all find that
things<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.709> improving<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.820> saw<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.420> i

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
things are improving as you saw when i

thing<00:03:42.060> point<00:03:42.390> 13<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.810> don't<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.050> why<00:03:43.140> that's<00:03:43.320> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
thing point 13 I don't know why that's a

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.199 
thing point 13 I don't know why that's a
lucky<00:03:43.770> number<00:03:43.800> today<00:03:44.330> but<00:03:45.330> very<00:03:46.170> terrible<00:03:47.209> so

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
lucky number today but very terrible so

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.670 
lucky number today but very terrible so
we'll<00:03:48.420> see<00:03:48.600> what<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> upload<00:03:49.140> speeds<00:03:49.440> look

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
we'll see what the upload speeds look

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.520 
we'll see what the upload speeds look
like<00:03:49.920> hopefully<00:03:50.400> improved<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:51.060> well<00:03:51.530> again

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
like hopefully improved as well again

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.370 
like hopefully improved as well again
I'll<00:03:52.709> run<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.040> test<00:03:53.480> twice<00:03:54.480> more<00:03:54.810> after<00:03:55.020> this

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
I'll run this test twice more after this

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.430 
I'll run this test twice more after this
and<00:03:55.680> we<00:03:56.280> will<00:03:56.459> compare<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.030> two<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:58.260> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
and we will compare the two so as you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.740 
and we will compare the two so as you
can<00:03:58.530> see<00:03:58.709> results<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.940> I'm<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.630> go

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
can see results on that I'm going to go

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.080 
can see results on that I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.959> run<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.550> rest<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.730> tests<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
ahead and run the rest of the tests and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.600 
ahead and run the rest of the tests and
I'll<00:04:03.180> be<00:04:03.330> back<00:04:03.680> alright<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.860> speed<00:04:05.190> tests<00:04:05.520> are

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
I'll be back alright so speed tests are

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.990 
I'll be back alright so speed tests are
done<00:04:05.959> extremely<00:04:06.959> extremely<00:04:07.830> consistent<00:04:08.430> I've

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
done extremely extremely consistent I've

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880 
done extremely extremely consistent I've
really<00:04:09.420> never<00:04:09.600> seen<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.110> before<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.709> kind

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
really never seen this before it's kind

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.790 
really never seen this before it's kind
of<00:04:10.920> crazy<00:04:11.220> how<00:04:11.459> consistent<00:04:12.239> this<00:04:12.360> is<00:04:12.800> but

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
of crazy how consistent this is but

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.400 
of crazy how consistent this is but
anyways<00:04:14.160> as<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.520> can<00:04:14.730> see<00:04:15.000> really<00:04:15.959> really

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
anyways as you can see really really

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.340 
anyways as you can see really really
close<00:04:16.680> all<00:04:17.010> throughout<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.640> board

upload<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.750> mean<00:04:26.990> you're<00:04:27.110> really<00:04:27.530> staying

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
upload so I mean you're really staying

upload so I mean you're really staying
about<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.430> same<00:04:28.550> at<00:04:28.850> least<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.180> was<00:04:29.480> every

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
about the same at least I was every

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.840 
about the same at least I was every
phone<00:04:30.200> handles<00:04:30.680> each<00:04:30.830> modem<00:04:31.130> differently<00:04:31.670> so

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
phone handles each modem differently so

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.920 
phone handles each modem differently so
definitely<00:04:32.120> going<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.330> test<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.660> out<00:04:32.720> for

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
definitely going to test it out for

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.510 
definitely going to test it out for
yourself<00:04:33.290> I'm<00:04:33.740> definitely<00:04:33.980> gonna<00:04:34.220> stick<00:04:34.490> with

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
yourself I'm definitely gonna stick with

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.730 
yourself I'm definitely gonna stick with
this<00:04:34.700> modem<00:04:35.090> see<00:04:35.540> what<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.780> looks<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.140> see

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
this modem see what it looks like see

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
this modem see what it looks like see
what<00:04:36.860> signal<00:04:37.190> strength<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.700> like<00:04:37.910> GPS<00:04:38.650> locking

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
what signal strength is like GPS locking

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.550 
what signal strength is like GPS locking
maybe<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:41.210> get<00:04:41.270> 4G<00:04:41.540> probably<00:04:42.050> not<00:04:42.230> just

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
maybe I can get 4G probably not just

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.620 
maybe I can get 4G probably not just
kidding<00:04:42.830> but<00:04:43.730> anyways<00:04:44.150> I'm<00:04:44.360> going<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.570> go

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
kidding but anyways I'm going to go

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.840 
kidding but anyways I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:44.840> test<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.140> do<00:04:45.260> some<00:04:45.470> real-world

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
ahead and test it do some real-world

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.580 
ahead and test it do some real-world
testing<00:04:46.850> on<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.900> which<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.260> always<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.560> best

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
testing on this which is always the best

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.760 
testing on this which is always the best
for<00:04:49.490> yourself<00:04:50.170> just<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.230> test<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.650> out<00:04:51.710> see

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
for yourself just to test it out see

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.860 
for yourself just to test it out see
what<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.370> your<00:04:52.760> 3G<00:04:53.210> speeds<00:04:53.420> are<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.720> in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
what the your 3G speeds are like in

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.230 
what the your 3G speeds are like in
different<00:04:54.170> areas<00:04:54.500> because<00:04:55.030> see<00:04:56.030> what<00:04:56.150> it's

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
different areas because see what it's

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.520 
different areas because see what it's
like<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.600> different<00:04:56.900> areas<00:04:57.080> if<00:04:57.200> you're<00:04:57.350> just

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
like in different areas if you're just

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.500 
like in different areas if you're just
not<00:04:57.890> getting<00:04:58.070> any<00:04:58.340> 3g<00:04:58.760> connection<00:04:59.210> whatsoever

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
not getting any 3g connection whatsoever

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.320 
not getting any 3g connection whatsoever
which<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.430> usually<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.610> get<00:05:01.790> connection<00:05:02.090> just

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
which I usually do get connection just

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.960 
which I usually do get connection just
awful<00:05:02.810> speeds<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:04.100> can<00:05:04.280> just<00:05:04.520> test<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.880> out

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
awful speeds you can just test it out

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.490 
awful speeds you can just test it out
for<00:05:05.210> yourself<00:05:05.510> but<00:05:05.720> anyways<00:05:05.990> that's<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.320> so

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
for yourself but anyways that's it so

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.170 
for yourself but anyways that's it so
that<00:05:06.650> would<00:05:06.800> be<00:05:06.920> me<00:05:07.100> comparing<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.670> e<00:05:07.700> l<00:05:07.910> 30

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
that would be me comparing the e l 30
