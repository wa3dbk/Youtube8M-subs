00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
Hollywood Park last him out but if you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.060 
Hollywood Park last him out but if you
saw<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:39.989> race<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.739> he<00:00:40.800> hit<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

front kind of pulled himself up and was

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
front kind of pulled himself up and was
nailed<00:00:44.070> late<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.059> think<00:00:45.360> he'll<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.170> more

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
nailed late but I think he'll be more

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
nailed late but I think he'll be more
patiently<00:00:46.950> handled<00:00:47.460> perhaps<00:00:47.789> try<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.059> make

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
patiently handled perhaps try to make

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
patiently handled perhaps try to make
the<00:00:48.420> last<00:00:48.690> run<00:00:49.050> maybe<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.370> him<00:00:50.760> get

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the last run maybe we'll see him get

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.729 
the last run maybe we'll see him get
reserved<00:00:51.750> behind<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> leaders<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> then

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
reserved behind the leaders and then

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
reserved behind the leaders and then
produce<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> last<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> final

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
produce the last one in the final

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
produce the last one in the final
furlong<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.629> let's<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.079> number<00:00:55.320> 10

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
