00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
jump off of that ledge you hold what we

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
jump off of that ledge you hold what we
call<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> prep<00:01:44.520> button<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.450> hit

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
call the prep button and then you hit

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350 
call the prep button and then you hit
jump<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.890> sort<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.399> disconnected

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
jump it's not this sort of disconnected

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
jump it's not this sort of disconnected
feeling<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.840> faster<00:01:49.289> you<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
feeling the faster you get with the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
feeling the faster you get with the
mechanics<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.420> faster<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.960> with

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
mechanics and the faster you get with

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.680 
mechanics and the faster you get with
the<00:01:52.229> controls<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.830> better<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.280> become<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
the controls the better you become so I

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.149 
the controls the better you become so I
think<00:01:54.780> damnation<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.830> different<00:01:55.979> from

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
think damnation is really different from

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.100 
think damnation is really different from
other<00:01:56.399> games<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.060> sense<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.959> only

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
other games in the sense that not only

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.419 
other games in the sense that not only
do<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.319> have<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.470> vertical<00:01:58.709> gameplay<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
do we have a vertical gameplay at a

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.520 
do we have a vertical gameplay at a
shooting<00:01:59.789> gameplay<00:02:00.149> mechanic<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
shooting gameplay mechanic but it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
shooting gameplay mechanic but it
actually<00:02:01.649> combines<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.310> two<00:02:02.549> together<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
actually combines those two together in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.520 
actually combines those two together in
other<00:02:03.299> games<00:02:03.509> often<00:02:03.810> times<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.229> you'll<00:02:04.350> see

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
other games often times what you'll see
