guy over the course of a couple of years
or<00:00:29.580> three<00:00:29.789> years<00:00:29.820> or<00:00:30.210> whatever<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
actually break this thing down backward

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.080 
actually break this thing down backward
engineer<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.700> paint<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
engineer it and then actually paint it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.459

over<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> course<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> hundred<00:00:37.200> days

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
over the course of like a hundred days

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
over the course of like a hundred days
and<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.210> boring<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> might

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and it's not as boring as you might

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
and it's not as boring as you might
think<00:00:39.989> watching<00:00:40.649> paint<00:00:40.860> dry<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> lot

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
think watching paint dry it's it's a lot

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
think watching paint dry it's it's a lot
more<00:00:42.300> interesting<00:00:43.079> least<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> found<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> very

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
more interesting least I found it very

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.139 
more interesting least I found it very
interesting<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> reason<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.120> bringing

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
interesting and the reason I'm bringing

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.810 
interesting and the reason I'm bringing
this<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> guys<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.550> Vermeer<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.700> the

this up to you guys is Vermeer at the
time<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.960> 350<00:00:49.530> years<00:00:49.590> ago<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.280> he's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
time like 350 years ago and I think he's

time like 350 years ago and I think he's
regard<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> most<00:00:51.600> famous

regard is one of the most famous
painters<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.520> around<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.510> again<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.079> not

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
painters in around and I'm again I'm not

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
anything like that but so Tim Vermeer

anything like that but so Tim Vermeer
basically<00:01:01.710> backward<00:01:02.489> engineer<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> figured

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
basically backward engineer to figured

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
back at the time it was probably like

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
back at the time it was probably like
all<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.040> painters<00:01:08.369> must<00:01:08.549> be

up to just a few years ago before Tim
figured<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.610> nobody<00:01:17.610> knew<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.000> he<00:01:18.090> was

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
figured this out nobody knew what he was

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
figured this out nobody knew what he was
doing<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> create<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.200> cinematic<00:01:19.799> look

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
doing to create this very cinematic look

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.600 
doing to create this very cinematic look
and<00:01:21.150> Tim<00:01:21.930> does<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.590> figures<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.280> he<00:01:23.340> did

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and Tim does he figures out how he did

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
and Tim does he figures out how he did
optically<00:01:24.210> any<00:01:24.450> crates<00:01:24.900> recreates<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> thing

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
optically any crates recreates a thing

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.170 
optically any crates recreates a thing
and<00:01:26.330> Tim's<00:01:27.330> version<00:01:27.930> looks<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:29.040> amazing<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and Tim's version looks just amazing so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
and Tim's version looks just amazing so
this<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.659> thinking<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.320> Tim<00:01:31.650> could<00:01:31.950> figure

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this got me thinking if Tim could figure

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
this got me thinking if Tim could figure
out<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:33.210> Vermeer<00:01:33.930> did<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> from<00:01:34.590> 350<00:01:35.189> years

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
out how Vermeer did it from 350 years

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
out how Vermeer did it from 350 years
ago<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.909> no<00:01:36.060> behind<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> scenes

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
ago and there was no behind the scenes

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.969 
ago and there was no behind the scenes
there's<00:01:37.229> no<00:01:37.939> stills<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:40.079> people

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
anything like that he just figured it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
anything like that he just figured it
all<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> got<00:01:45.810> me<00:01:45.840> thinking<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.500> if

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
all out so it got me thinking what if

you<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> always<00:01:47.610> struggle<00:01:48.240> with

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you know and I always struggle with

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
you know and I always struggle with

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
trying to come up with really cinematic

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
trying to come up with really cinematic
looking<00:01:51.030> images<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
looking images that you would see in the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.819 
looking images that you would see in the
movie<00:01:52.560> theater<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.049> could<00:01:55.409> create

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
movie theater so what if I could create

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
movie theater so what if I could create
some<00:01:56.159> sort<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.520> learning<00:01:57.000> tool<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
some sort of learning tool like this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
some sort of learning tool like this
because<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.860> watch<00:01:59.009> Tim<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.450> being

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
because you watch Tim go from not being

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.539 
because you watch Tim go from not being
a<00:02:00.780> painter<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.799> probably<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
a painter at all to be probably one of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
a painter at all to be probably one of
the<00:02:02.700> best<00:02:02.850> painters<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> world<00:02:03.570> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the best painters in the world just

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.539 
the best painters in the world just
because<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.770> technique<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> he's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
because of this technique that he's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.020 
because of this technique that he's
using<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.500> thinking<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.970> could

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
using so got me thinking what if I could

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.760 
using so got me thinking what if I could
create<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:11.099> doing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
create a way of doing

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.220 
create a way of doing
this<00:02:11.950> backward<00:02:12.370> engineering<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.120> movie<00:02:14.020> scene

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
this backward engineering a movie scene

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.800 
this backward engineering a movie scene
and<00:02:14.730> learning<00:02:15.730> from<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.300> then<00:02:16.510> being<00:02:16.720> able

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
and learning from it and then being able

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.570 
and learning from it and then being able
to<00:02:17.020> apply<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.740> other<00:02:17.950> things<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.460> do

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
to apply it to other things that I do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.250 
to apply it to other things that I do
and<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.020> take<00:02:20.230> that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
and it's just like you have to take that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.440 
and it's just like you have to take that
one<00:02:20.470> still<00:02:20.980> in<00:02:21.160> time<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.790> one<00:02:22.030> scene<00:02:22.420> in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
one still in time or that one scene in

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.960 
one still in time or that one scene in
time<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.080> don't<00:02:23.710> know<00:02:23.830> exactly<00:02:24.220> how<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.820> it

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
time I don't know exactly how to do it

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
time I don't know exactly how to do it
you<00:02:25.330> know<00:02:25.450> because<00:02:25.600> today<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:26.350> new<00:02:26.500> modern

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
you know because today with new modern

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.980 
you know because today with new modern
technology<00:02:27.400> there's<00:02:27.630> obviously<00:02:28.630> there's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
technology there's obviously there's

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.260 
technology there's obviously there's
special<00:02:29.560> effects<00:02:29.830> there's<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.730> know<00:02:30.760> massive

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
special effects there's you know massive

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.820 
special effects there's you know massive
color<00:02:31.480> grading<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.590> stuff<00:02:32.650> like

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
color grading going on and stuff like

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.590 
color grading going on and stuff like
that<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.250> can't<00:02:33.340> backward<00:02:34.120> engineer

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
that that you can't backward engineer

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.950 
that that you can't backward engineer
like<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.080> would<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.500> Vermeer's<00:02:36.190> painting

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
like you would a Vermeer's painting

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.420 
like you would a Vermeer's painting
because<00:02:37.960> that<00:02:38.170> was<00:02:38.290> very<00:02:38.500> realistic<00:02:39.100> whereas

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
because that was very realistic whereas

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.250 
because that was very realistic whereas
the<00:02:39.790> movies<00:02:40.150> today<00:02:40.330> are<00:02:40.600> not<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.990> realistic

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the movies today are not so realistic

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.460 
the movies today are not so realistic
but<00:02:41.590> if<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.770> were<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:41.980> take<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.820> movie<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.440> know

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
but if I were to take a a movie you know

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.350 
but if I were to take a a movie you know
a<00:02:44.590> shot<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.070> film<00:02:45.250> many<00:02:45.670> years<00:02:45.880> ago<00:02:46.030> that's

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
a shot on film many years ago that's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.930 
a shot on film many years ago that's
very<00:02:46.630> cinematic<00:02:47.430> before<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.460> whole<00:02:48.640> bunch<00:02:48.850> of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
very cinematic before a whole bunch of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.580 
very cinematic before a whole bunch of
color<00:02:49.090> grading<00:02:49.450> came<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> scene<00:02:50.110> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
color grading came on the scene and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.130 
color grading came on the scene and
recreate<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.880> think<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.810> would<00:02:52.900> be<00:02:53.050> an

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
recreate that I think that would be an

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.900 
recreate that I think that would be an
awesome<00:02:53.320> learning<00:02:53.860> tool<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.460> definitely<00:02:54.670> go

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
awesome learning tool so definitely go

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.350 
awesome learning tool so definitely go
see<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.270> movie<00:02:55.330> um<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:57.070> was<00:02:57.370> amazed<00:02:57.910> by<00:02:58.300> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
see this movie um I was amazed by the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.290 
see this movie um I was amazed by the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
dress the girls dress and the carpet

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.440 
dress the girls dress and the carpet
that<00:03:01.450> he<00:03:01.570> painted<00:03:01.810> um<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.640> don't<00:03:03.640> know<00:03:03.880> how<00:03:04.420> many

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
that he painted um I don't know how many

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.270 
that he painted um I don't know how many
times<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:05.050> said<00:03:05.290> wow<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.830> must<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.160> been<00:03:06.220> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
times I said wow it must have been a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.010 
times I said wow it must have been a
couple<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.670> dozens<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.390> movie<00:03:07.690> because

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
couple of dozens in that movie because

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.370 
couple of dozens in that movie because
the<00:03:08.830> way<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.190> light<00:03:09.430> falls<00:03:09.790> off<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.510> color

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
the way the light falls off the color

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.520 
the way the light falls off the color
reproduction<00:03:12.280> all<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.510> stuff<00:03:13.780> looks<00:03:14.080> so

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
reproduction all this stuff looks so

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.120 
reproduction all this stuff looks so
cinematic<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:16.230> amazing<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.440> don't<00:03:17.800> know<00:03:17.950> how

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
cinematic and amazing I don't know how

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.680 
cinematic and amazing I don't know how
else<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.459> describe<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.300> got<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> go

else to describe you just got to go

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.720 
else to describe you just got to go
watch<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.590> whole<00:03:21.220> thing<00:03:21.430> got<00:03:21.580> me

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
watch it and that whole thing got me

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.730 
watch it and that whole thing got me
thinking<00:03:22.120> about<00:03:22.390> well<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:22.990> he<00:03:23.200> could<00:03:23.380> recreate

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
thinking about well if he could recreate

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.430 
thinking about well if he could recreate
this<00:03:23.980> from<00:03:24.280> an<00:03:24.400> oil<00:03:24.580> painting<00:03:24.940> can<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.050> do<00:03:26.110> this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
this from an oil painting can I do this

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.160 
this from an oil painting can I do this
you<00:03:26.709> know<00:03:27.090> photographically<00:03:28.090> or<00:03:28.270> you<00:03:28.870> know<00:03:28.990> in

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
you know photographically or you know in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.230 
you know photographically or you know in
a<00:03:29.230> movie<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.250> become<00:03:30.520> like<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> master

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
a movie so this become like a master

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.850 
a movie so this become like a master
class<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.750> getting<00:03:32.050> inside<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.500> somebody's

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
class like getting inside of somebody's

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.620 
class like getting inside of somebody's
head<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.190> Tim<00:03:33.459> really<00:03:33.940> needed<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.390> get

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
head like Tim really needed to get

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.810 
head like Tim really needed to get
inside<00:03:34.990> of<00:03:35.170> Vermeer's<00:03:35.500> head<00:03:35.740> to<00:03:36.280> understand

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
inside of Vermeer's head to understand

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.880 
inside of Vermeer's head to understand
what<00:03:37.000> he<00:03:37.060> was<00:03:37.150> doing<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.690> that's<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.650> same

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
what he was doing and that's the same

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.500 
what he was doing and that's the same
thing<00:03:39.190> if<00:03:39.340> i<00:03:39.459> could<00:03:39.640> get<00:03:39.760> inside<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.330> some

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
thing if i could get inside of some

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.290 
thing if i could get inside of some
famous<00:03:40.990> dp's<00:03:41.590> head<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.160> really<00:03:42.850> backward

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
famous dp's head and really backward

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.120 
famous dp's head and really backward
engineer<00:03:43.720> everything<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:44.380> for<00:03:45.100> that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
engineer everything and just for that

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.350 
engineer everything and just for that
one<00:03:45.220> scene<00:03:45.580> i<00:03:45.730> know<00:03:45.790> it'd<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.120> really

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
one scene i know it'd be really

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.270 
one scene i know it'd be really
labor-intensive<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.170> once<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.740> I<00:03:47.800> think<00:03:47.890> go

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
labor-intensive but once you I think go

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.100 
labor-intensive but once you I think go
through<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.610> exercise<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.990> would

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
through the exercise that you would

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.840 
through the exercise that you would
really<00:03:50.320> understand<00:03:50.920> how<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.490> next<00:03:51.610> time

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
really understand how to do it next time

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.570 
really understand how to do it next time
in<00:03:52.090> multiple<00:03:52.570> different<00:03:53.320> ways<00:03:53.530> because<00:03:54.370> you

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
in multiple different ways because you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.250 
in multiple different ways because you
would<00:03:54.790> basically<00:03:55.300> get<00:03:55.630> into<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.020> thought

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
would basically get into that thought

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.770 
would basically get into that thought
process<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.340> if<00:03:57.430> anybody<00:03:57.760> has<00:03:57.940> any<00:03:57.970> ideas<00:03:58.750> of

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
process so if anybody has any ideas of

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.760 
process so if anybody has any ideas of
seeing<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.320> movie<00:03:59.790> how<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.090> do<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.770> for

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
seeing that movie how you can do it for

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.440 
seeing that movie how you can do it for
this<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.670> put<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.000> comments<00:04:04.360> below

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
this to put it in the comments below

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.850 
this to put it in the comments below
because<00:04:04.570> I'm<00:04:04.810> still<00:04:05.020> kind<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.320> thinking<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.709> my

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
because I'm still kind of thinking in my

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.800 
because I'm still kind of thinking in my
head<00:04:05.890> how<00:04:06.190> can<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.520> do<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:06.880> because<00:04:07.090> I'm<00:04:07.630> sure

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
head how can I do this because I'm sure

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.110 
head how can I do this because I'm sure
other<00:04:08.020> people<00:04:08.170> have<00:04:08.350> like<00:04:08.590> reproduced<00:04:09.220> movie

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
other people have like reproduced movie

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.479 
other people have like reproduced movie
scenes<00:04:10.390> but<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.200> mean<00:04:11.440> down<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.920> precision

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
scenes but I mean down to the precision

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.560 
scenes but I mean down to the precision
that<00:04:13.239> what<00:04:13.570> Tim<00:04:14.320> did<00:04:14.590> Tim<00:04:15.160> Jensen<00:04:15.580> did<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:16.209> think

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
that what Tim did Tim Jensen did I think

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.970 
that what Tim did Tim Jensen did I think
that<00:04:16.600> we<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:16.840> cool<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.709> that's<00:04:17.859> pretty

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
that we really cool so that's pretty

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.170 
that we really cool so that's pretty
much<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.190> if<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.580> guys<00:04:18.669> are<00:04:18.790> interested<00:04:18.940> i

Drive and

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.320 
Drive and
has<00:04:24.289> this<00:04:24.409> new<00:04:24.680> rapid<00:04:25.310> feature<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:26.030> don't<00:04:26.240> know

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
has this new rapid feature I don't know

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.209 
has this new rapid feature I don't know
what<00:04:26.659> the<00:04:26.840> rapid<00:04:27.199> stands<00:04:27.499> for<00:04:27.800> anything<00:04:28.009> like

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:28.219 
what the rapid stands for anything like

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:29.980 
what the rapid stands for anything like
that<00:04:28.249> but<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.699> basically<00:04:28.819> uses<00:04:29.270> your<00:04:29.599> RAM<00:04:29.780> or

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
that but it basically uses your RAM or

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.890 
that but it basically uses your RAM or
something<00:04:30.259> I<00:04:30.319> have<00:04:30.439> 32<00:04:30.800> gig<00:04:31.009> ram<00:04:31.189> in<00:04:31.460> my

something I have 32 gig ram in my
monster<00:04:32.900> computer<00:04:33.439> and<00:04:34.029> it's<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:36.080> fast<00:04:36.349> it's

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
monster computer and it's it's fast it's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.809 
monster computer and it's it's fast it's
like<00:04:37.389> 900<00:04:38.389> rights<00:04:39.139> 900<00:04:39.889> reads<00:04:40.129> kind<00:04:40.460> of<00:04:40.580> fast

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
like 900 rights 900 reads kind of fast

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.330 
like 900 rights 900 reads kind of fast
compared<00:04:41.509> to<00:04:41.749> something<00:04:42.469> like<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.740> without

2 1 terabyte why would you ever create a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.200 
2 1 terabyte why would you ever create a
raid<00:04:56.740> if<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:58.069> was<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.520> for<00:04:58.759> video<00:04:59.090> editing

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
raid if it was just for video editing

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.459 
raid if it was just for video editing
and<00:04:59.629> you<00:04:59.689> could<00:04:59.810> fit<00:04:59.990> everything<00:05:00.229> on<00:05:00.409> a

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
and you could fit everything on a

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.709 
and you could fit everything on a
terabyte<00:05:00.889> let's<00:05:01.099> say<00:05:01.279> and<00:05:01.599> redundancy<00:05:02.599> it

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
terabyte let's say and redundancy it

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.260 
terabyte let's say and redundancy it
wasn't<00:05:02.990> an<00:05:03.080> issue<00:05:03.199> these<00:05:04.189> speeds<00:05:04.580> are<00:05:04.849> just

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
wasn't an issue these speeds are just

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.339 
wasn't an issue these speeds are just
insane<00:05:05.990> they're<00:05:06.529> really<00:05:06.740> really<00:05:06.949> fast<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:08.349> if

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
insane they're really really fast so if

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.379 
insane they're really really fast so if
your<00:05:09.560> interest<00:05:09.860> did<00:05:10.039> I've<00:05:10.310> got<00:05:10.639> this<00:05:10.819> this<00:05:11.210> is

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
your interest did I've got this this is

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.320 
your interest did I've got this this is
actually<00:05:11.750> brand-new<00:05:12.259> I<00:05:13.069> sent<00:05:13.759> it<00:05:13.879> back<00:05:14.029> and

forth between crucial cuz I was having

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.279 
forth between crucial cuz I was having
some<00:05:16.370> problems<00:05:16.759> with<00:05:16.819> it<00:05:17.060> over<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.990> last<00:05:18.080> year

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
some problems with it over the last year
