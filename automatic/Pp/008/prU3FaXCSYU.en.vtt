00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.380 
very good thing because it opened up a
whole<00:03:22.110> bag<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.650> new<00:03:22.980> tricks<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.580> DJ<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.150> do

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
whole bag of new tricks that a DJ can do

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.840 
whole bag of new tricks that a DJ can do
like<00:03:25.080> combining<00:03:25.620> hot<00:03:25.920> cues<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.430> three

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
like combining hot cues of three

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.520 
like combining hot cues of three
different<00:03:27.030> tracks<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.990> three<00:03:28.350> different

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
different tracks of the three different

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.550 
different tracks of the three different
speeds<00:03:29.030> combining<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.560> track

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
speeds combining that with a track

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.620 
speeds combining that with a track
that's<00:03:31.590> already<00:03:32.010> running<00:03:32.340> or<00:03:32.850> even<00:03:33.209> combine

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
that's already running or even combine

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.390 
that's already running or even combine
the<00:03:33.840> sinc<00:03:34.080> function<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> slip<00:03:34.920> function

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the sinc function with a slip function

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.610 
the sinc function with a slip function
and<00:03:35.550> that<00:03:35.580> definitely<00:03:36.420> gives<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> whole

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
and that definitely gives you a whole

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.190 
and that definitely gives you a whole
new<00:03:37.680> load<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.310> new<00:03:38.910> things<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:40.050> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
new load of new things you can do in the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.809 
new load of new things you can do in the
DJ<00:03:40.350> booth<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.860> otherwise<00:03:41.400> would<00:03:41.700> be

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
DJ booth that otherwise would be

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.690 
DJ booth that otherwise would be
impossible<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.600> do<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:42.959> other<00:03:43.860> than<00:03:44.280> the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
impossible to do so other than the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.760 
impossible to do so other than the
simple<00:03:44.940> stuff<00:03:45.239> people<00:03:45.600> could<00:03:45.900> use<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.260> you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
simple stuff people could use it for you

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.070 
simple stuff people could use it for you
can<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.370> lot<00:03:47.850> more<00:03:48.060> difficult<00:03:48.570> stuff<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
can have a lot more difficult stuff and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.050 
can have a lot more difficult stuff and
complicated<00:03:49.800> tricks<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.880> now

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
complicated tricks that you can now

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.180 
complicated tricks that you can now
perform<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.930> sync<00:03:52.260> button<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:53.010> would

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
perform with the sync button that would

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.800 
perform with the sync button that would
not<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.370> built<00:03:53.700> possible<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.390> was<00:03:54.660> not

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
not be built possible if it was not
