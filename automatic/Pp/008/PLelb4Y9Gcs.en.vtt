00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.469
 good that so welcome a new 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.330
 video drug following with the series of 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.369
 videos where we want to help you 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.129
 recover your lost data in 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.680
 icloud in this case we are doing the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.340
 examples with our agenda with our 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.250
 contacts let's see one of the ways 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.300
 simpler to restore our 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.590
 contacts in case of loss of one of 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.440
 the functions incorporated in mac os x 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.780
 For some time now it has been the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.090
 possibility of making copies of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.090
 security with time machine there are more without 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.310
 easily it enables copies 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.860
 and also the data recovery 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.420
 any user is of the level that is 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 will be able to recover your files 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.180
 easily fine here we can see the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.550
 icon that appears in the bar where 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.469
 we have the backup we can 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.840
 always see what is the most 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.399
 recent we easily have the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.940
 possibility of making a copy of 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.940
 security now 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.960
 and we see that the disk of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 security and the copy is made with the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 modifications that have been these are 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 the time machine preferences where 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 we can select the disk that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.760
 we want to use in agreement we have the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 possibility to activate or deactivate 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.070
 service and we have some options that we 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.360
 will allow you to discard what you do not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.660
 we want it to be included in the copy 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 such as other hard drives or certain 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.450
 folders really when we want 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040
 recover contacts and even mails the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.230
 only that folder that we have to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.330
 save is the free folder and from our 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.880
 user that is we can discard 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.530
 anything else while that folder 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.300
 we will be able to recover contacts 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 we can even recover mails well 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.060
 configured with configured in our 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.659
 disk 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.020
 and you will make those copies will be very 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.490
 simple 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.869
 to recover any contact 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.580
 lost 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.450
 for this we are going to eliminate 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.450
 in this contact 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.100
 so you can see an example as you can 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.420
 see are written in night cloud the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.670
 information with which we have already lost 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.260
 that contact in the cloud is no longer that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.020
 contact in any of the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.580
 devices or equipment that we have and what 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.350
 what we are going to do is proceed to enter 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.740
 up there rather to recover a 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.180
 contact of the agenda 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.980
 we will open the agenda because it is the way 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.470
 easier to recover contacts with 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 the agenda open what we are going to do 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.440
 is to enter the timer without entering 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.440
 from here 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.950
 we enter the time machine and how can we 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.950
 see we have 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.900
 in the time bar the copies of 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.329
 agreement that we have made 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.100
 we can also move to the last 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.130
 change 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.340
 as we can see here appears the 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.420
 Contact removed and how we have it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.960
 here we select and use the button 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.960
 restore 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.040
 then we return to the desk we 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.980
 gives the option to add and we 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.590
 we add that contact and as we see already 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.540
 is writing in aitor with which 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.180
 that card that we had lost 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.600
 recently becomes available 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.690
 for all devices well as 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.280
 veis time machine will help us not 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.130
 only in this case but in many others 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.350
 it would almost be an indispensable requirement in 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.360
 any team have a copy of 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.550
 security if you do not have hard drives 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.240
 large and since the teams have 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.390
 each time larger or larger hard drives 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.420
 space and that we fill we can use 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.610
 discs of less capacity but always 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.270
 saving what we find more 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.290
 useful folder of documents folders of 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:14.090
 the free one of our user and 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.830
 any other file or any other 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.630
 folder that you need we can discard 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.730
 all the remains and we see that we can 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.739
 recover simply but one 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.660
 simple and a tiny copy of 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.480
 security will save us in more than one 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.520
 chance 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.240
 well this is all we see in a 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.240
 next pit
