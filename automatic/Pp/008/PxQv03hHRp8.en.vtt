00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I do want to reiterate what I said

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200 
I do want to reiterate what I said
earlier<00:01:33.920> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.250> video<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
earlier in the other video about the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
earlier in the other video about the
dark<00:01:36.420> chocolate<00:01:36.479> truffle<00:01:37.110> build<00:01:37.369> its<00:01:38.369> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
dark chocolate truffle build its really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
dark chocolate truffle build its really
really<00:01:39.119> effective<00:01:39.689> against<00:01:39.960> or

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
really effective against or

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.340 
really effective against or
especially<00:01:42.400> if<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:43.210> know<00:01:43.330> they<00:01:43.540> don't<00:01:43.570> expect

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
especially if you know they don't expect

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.000 
especially if you know they don't expect
anything<00:01:44.650> like<00:01:44.980> it<00:01:46.320> they<00:01:47.320> take<00:01:47.500> up<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.800> layer

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
anything like it they take up to layer

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.880 
anything like it they take up to layer
but<00:01:48.550> don't<00:01:48.790> get<00:01:48.910> an<00:01:49.030> overseer<00:01:49.590> usually<00:01:50.590> they

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
but don't get an overseer usually they

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.160 
but don't get an overseer usually they
don't<00:01:50.920> get<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.790> over<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.060> overseer<00:01:52.630> out<00:01:52.870> in

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
don't get the over the overseer out in

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.820 
don't get the over the overseer out in
time<00:01:53.490> before<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.910> cause<00:01:55.150> enough<00:01:55.830> damage

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
time before you can cause enough damage

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.470 
time before you can cause enough damage
so<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.730> mean<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.270> be<00:01:58.360> really

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
so I mean it's going to be really

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240 
so I mean it's going to be really
effective<00:01:58.720> even<00:01:59.230> if<00:01:59.320> they<00:01:59.440> stop<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.950> it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
effective even if they stop it it's

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.760 
effective even if they stop it it's
going<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.460> do<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.910> it's<00:02:01.030> supposed<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.330> do<00:02:01.540> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to do what it's supposed to do and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520 
going to do what it's supposed to do and
hopefully<00:02:02.770> we<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.370> get<00:02:03.550> that<00:02:03.820> ragequit

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
hopefully we can get that ragequit

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.000 
hopefully we can get that ragequit
achievement<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:06.930> haven't<00:02:07.930> seen<00:02:08.140> any<00:02:08.290> videos<00:02:08.680> on

how<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.340> obtain<00:02:09.730> that<00:02:10.119> achievement<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.440> i<00:02:11.470> am

exactly what turned out is doing he's

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.699 
exactly what turned out is doing he's
getting<00:03:31.780> his<00:03:31.989> natural<00:03:32.500> expo<00:03:33.540> while<00:03:34.540> we<00:03:34.810> go<00:03:35.560> on

getting his natural expo while we go on

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.190 
getting his natural expo while we go on
our<00:03:35.860> merry<00:03:35.920> way<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.760> continue<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.450> build<00:03:37.870> a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
our merry way and continue to build a

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.820 
our merry way and continue to build a
twinkie<00:03:39.040> council

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.000 

yeah<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.300> doing<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.420> build<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.170> always<00:03:47.830> want

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
yeah so doing this build you always want

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.449 
yeah so doing this build you always want
to<00:03:48.069> get<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.550> double<00:03:49.000> gas<00:03:49.209> right<00:03:49.900> away<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:51.430> can

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
to get the double gas right away you can

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.059 
to get the double gas right away you can
get<00:03:51.790> away<00:03:51.910> with<00:03:52.270> getting<00:03:53.200> them<00:03:53.380> similar<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:54.040> a

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
get away with getting them similar to a

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.809 
get away with getting them similar to a
forged<00:03:54.670> bill<00:03:54.970> for<00:03:55.330> gate<00:03:55.540> build<00:03:55.780> which<00:03:56.110> is

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
forged bill for gate build which is

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.120 
forged bill for gate build which is
getting<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:57.970> gas<00:03:58.270> at<00:03:58.600> 14<00:03:59.260> supply<00:03:59.770> and

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
getting this gas at 14 supply and

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.690 
getting this gas at 14 supply and
getting<00:04:00.640> this<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:01.030> about<00:04:01.270> 17<00:04:02.020> or<00:04:02.200> 18<00:04:02.700> that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
getting this at about 17 or 18 that

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.550 
getting this at about 17 or 18 that
should<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.060> ok<00:04:04.090> but<00:04:04.900> if<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:05.080> want<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.290> be<00:04:05.380> more

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
should be ok but if you want to be more

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.920 
should be ok but if you want to be more
aggressive<00:04:05.800> you<00:04:06.760> want<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.150> them<00:04:07.420> both<00:04:07.630> at

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
aggressive you want to get them both at

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.800 
aggressive you want to get them both at
the<00:04:07.989> same<00:04:08.080> time<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:08.860> will<00:04:09.610> actually

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
the same time and that will actually

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.259 
the same time and that will actually
allow<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.470> create<00:04:11.709> more<00:04:12.459> dark<00:04:12.760> templars

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
allow you to create more dark templars

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.729 
allow you to create more dark templars
faster<00:04:14.080> sooner<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.540> another<00:04:17.230> thing<00:04:17.440> i<00:04:17.560> wanted

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
faster sooner and another thing i wanted

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.159 
faster sooner and another thing i wanted
to<00:04:17.829> point<00:04:17.919> out<00:04:18.220> with<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.750> dark<00:04:19.750> chocolate

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
to point out with this dark chocolate

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.680 
to point out with this dark chocolate
truffle<00:04:20.500> build<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.880> because<00:04:22.120> dark

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
truffle build is that because dark

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.440 
truffle build is that because dark
chocolate<00:04:23.530> truffles<00:04:23.560> are<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.400> gasps<00:04:25.210> its

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
chocolate truffles are so gasps its

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.590 
chocolate truffles are so gasps its
intensive<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.980> really<00:04:27.250> only<00:04:27.450> put<00:04:28.450> out

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
intensive you can really only put out

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.650 
intensive you can really only put out
zealots<00:04:29.500> because<00:04:30.040> Ellis<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.520> cost<00:04:30.790> 100

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
minerals they don't cost any gas I did

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.770 
minerals they don't cost any gas I did
take<00:04:34.930> out<00:04:35.080> put<00:04:35.770> out<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.890> stalker<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.630> only

take out put out a stalker but that only

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.200 
take out put out a stalker but that only
cost<00:04:40.080> 50<00:04:41.080> 50<00:04:41.680> guests<00:04:41.889> which<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.430> too<00:04:42.639> bad<00:04:42.850> but

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
cost 50 50 guests which is a too bad but

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.620 
cost 50 50 guests which is a too bad but
it<00:04:44.080> does<00:04:44.290> really<00:04:44.610> affect<00:04:45.610> how<00:04:46.210> many<00:04:46.390> dark

place<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.639> do<00:05:40.759> it<00:05:40.940> because<00:05:41.690> they<00:05:41.810> have<00:05:41.990> the

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
place to do it because they have the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.070
