00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 and it was from youtube that the voice is the voice 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.939
 that then you were the sack of how 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.670
 put blood on the furniture and on the 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.290
 minecraft player is this going to be a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.910
 very simplistic system that will use 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.759
 just a great blog but will leave the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.040
 game a little more realistic and fun 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.029
 fight with bpp that friends against 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.850
 furniture etc. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 the command is the description is a command 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 very extensive but it because it will create 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.140
 a system of in as of blogs 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.699
 You must have a 30 as blocks in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.769
 sequence to be able to do this theme 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.789
 because it 's a coward blog for each type 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:50.429
 particle and also the command that 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.859
 after all it does not even seem to have a good ending 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:59.129
 but it's just you copy it is with the soul 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the block on the floor here on the floor 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.050
 put mann not against a control and v 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.800
 it's over 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.180
 you lose a block already stone and active 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.590
 will be a box pillar 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 remember that there is a dot 8 appearing 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 sand that is minus a point and try 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 give a point up can break 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.550
 again the whole system will be here 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.590
 inside this window is already going 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.950
 have two options turn off the system 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.110
 turn off blood and turn on the blood is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.730
 connected it will always be working 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 no furniture you should call not to give 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.930
 give you one thing you come and put it off 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 It will be left on 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.620
 how will a particle of furniture 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.620
 for you that clip so that tt 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.240
 My name is a petite little one. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.470
 because at the beginning it varies 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.909
 depending on the size because it is a club 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.060
 of boxing for every thing then of how 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.060
 to set up 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.340
 the furniture goals are not 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.790
 the Bosnians also have that we have a name 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 they want the enderson still play 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.510
 he is careful because he is 100 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.100
 date for the new year to see then no 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 it is possible to hit but normally from the game 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.440
 was to hit 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.180
 remember that these furniture that stay in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.870
 other dimensions you need to put the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.250
 system 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.739
 in the other dimension, for example if 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.930
 mobile nelsinho placed neder 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.330
 if it is mobile 18 of the tooth in each one 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.050
 So that they can not function will not 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.580
 to function 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.590
 but I put what we talked about 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.130
 for 10 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.200
 after that it was also shown that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.850
 the player is also sending it too 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.850
