00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.530
 hello everyone my name is rubÃ©n 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.840
 welcome to another video tutorial from 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.180
 blender course we continue with the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.660
 chapter dedicated to modifiers and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.610
 let's see the scrum modifier that 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.090
 translated into Spanish I was born something like that 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.660
 as screw or screw 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.830
 to see it we are going from a plane 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 we are going to be more and more 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.190
 plane 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:47.399
 we go to the modifiers every time 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.399
 modify and we would go to write 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.870
 a series of options appear well 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.210
 cut the shaft we will do in the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.520
 Z axis would be the axis of the screw 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.579
 and then the amount of writing appears 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.260
 that we can introduce let's go 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:12.040
 adding other entities we are going to remove 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.159
 zoom so you can see it totally 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.619
 to stay in the amount of 6 then 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.860
 options like the angle of 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.220
 screwed in this case you see that if I 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.460
 I'm modifying, the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 Angle angle of twisting the mesh 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.560
 number of steps of a single revolution or 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
 be a single return let's go 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.180
 changing and louis how is changing the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.180
 mesh geometry 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.530
 render step would be the same as the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.360
 previous but in the render view for 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:58.040
 expand either the resolution or to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.440
 expand the way I know 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.380
 revolutionizes the mesh with this is achieved 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.510
 more detail the render view situation of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.610
 here it is clear has softened of 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.790
 of the mesh 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.819
 and I to finish with the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.030
 modifier let's see 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.069
 an option would be interactions here what 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.340
 The only thing we do is the number of 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.620
 repeats of the revolution and since 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 let's go increasing you see that it's going 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.700
 expanding the mesh is the number of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.819
 revolutions let's leave it in two for 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.579
 example and to finish modifier 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.629
 let's make a left click there to 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.799
 place an object in addition we are going to make a 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.810
 cone because what are we going to do 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.069
 we select the way we have 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.129
 previously 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.290
 we are going to use an object as an axis for 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.760
 see what it is 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.519
 we click there and we use the cone and you see 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.889
 that the revolution is different because 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.049
 uses the axis of the object that we 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.880
 we have given him right now and then 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.550
 we would have the option it hears you write 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.440
 that would use distance between axes 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.560
 of the objects you see that is also 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.870
 using the axis of the previous object 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:30.210
 active pulse and is using the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.150
 distance of the two axes of both the cone 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.260
 as the previous object is worth to do 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.349
 he writes 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.159
 well this is a greeting and even the 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.159
 next video tutorial
