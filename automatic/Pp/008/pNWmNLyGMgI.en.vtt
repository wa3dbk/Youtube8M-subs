00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.920
 There are doubts 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.650
 when I have a pain or have a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 injury should I use the water bag 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 hot or the ice 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.500
 when I was an athlete 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.740
 the daily routine or routine was if 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.130
 use within the first 24 hours 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:39.120
 ice and then heat the contrast 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:45.690
 this technique is not used so much today 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.050
 Today we use the ice always being that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.079
 As far as we know, ice well 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 applied in the first five minutes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.210
 he has a vasoconstriction and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 soon after this he has a vase 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.890
 reflex dilation then it is a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.180
 excellent analgesic and does not give the effect 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 rebound that the heat gives when applied 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.740
 this rule is not valid for trauma 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 in the thoracic region that usually 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 heat is best applied and better 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.650
 received by patients 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.500
 and then tip any trauma pain 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:43.470
 Muscle bruises immediately on ice 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.140
 and the 30-minute application period 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.320
 number of times a day also does not 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.040
 It's good to leave the ice for three 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.440
 four five hours as some athletes 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 the phase a hug 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.260
 [Music] 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.709
 [Applause] 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.709
