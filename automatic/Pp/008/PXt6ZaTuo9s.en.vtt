you<00:02:20.780> normally<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.280> working<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.370> more<00:02:22.550> hip

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you normally would working on more hip

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.930 
you normally would working on more hip
stability<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.480> glute<00:02:23.630> strength<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.940> then

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
stability and glute strength and then

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.490 
stability and glute strength and then
the<00:02:26.030> moves<00:02:26.270> are<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.720> helping<00:02:26.959> with<00:02:27.080> balance

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the moves are just helping with balance

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.910 
the moves are just helping with balance
little<00:02:28.430> functional<00:02:28.880> strength<00:02:29.830> getting<00:02:30.830> them

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
little functional strength getting them

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.190 
little functional strength getting them
loose<00:02:32.800> about<00:02:33.800> one<00:02:33.980> more<00:02:36.730> good<00:02:38.020> guys<00:02:39.020> one<00:02:39.170> on
