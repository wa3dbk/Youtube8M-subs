on<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:53.920> installation<00:00:54.309> I've<00:00:54.760> spoke<00:00:55.149> with<00:00:55.329> the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
on this installation I've spoke with the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.240 
on this installation I've spoke with the
actual<00:00:55.780> homeowner<00:00:56.140> we've<00:00:56.710> gone<00:00:56.860> over<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:57.129> few

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
actual homeowner we've gone over a few

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.680 
actual homeowner we've gone over a few
different<00:00:57.699> scenarios<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.270> how<00:00:58.629> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
different scenarios of how the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.540 
different scenarios of how the
installation<00:00:59.079> could<00:00:59.350> take<00:00:59.559> place<00:00:59.770> what<00:01:00.460> he

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
installation could take place what he

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.860 
installation could take place what he
wants<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.850> do<00:01:00.970> is<00:01:01.059> he<00:01:01.180> wants<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.390> actually<00:01:01.570> put

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
wants to do is he wants to actually put

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.689 
wants to do is he wants to actually put
it<00:01:01.960> on<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.290> back<00:01:02.530> while<00:01:02.829> utilizing<00:01:03.040> quite<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
it on that back while utilizing quite a

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.730 
it on that back while utilizing quite a
bit<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:03.970> space<00:01:04.180> over<00:01:04.330> here<00:01:04.479> for<00:01:04.780> storage<00:01:05.229> one

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
bit of space over here for storage one

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.499 
bit of space over here for storage one
way<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.369> actually<00:01:06.729> an<00:01:06.850> installation

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
way to do it is actually an installation

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.690 
way to do it is actually an installation
outside<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.680> minimizes<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.430> actual

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
outside that minimizes the actual

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.550 
outside that minimizes the actual
venting<00:01:10.090> installation<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:10.990> mount<00:01:11.350> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
venting installation you can mount the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.080 
venting installation you can mount the
unit<00:01:11.860> right<00:01:12.250> on<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.490> other<00:01:12.640> side<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.000> this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
unit right on the other side of this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.910 
unit right on the other side of this
walls<00:01:13.360> limiting<00:01:13.899> offs<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.350> plumbing<00:01:14.649> and

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
walls limiting offs on the plumbing and

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.139 
walls limiting offs on the plumbing and
how<00:01:15.009> much<00:01:15.190> that<00:01:15.369> has<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.670> be<00:01:15.729> done<00:01:15.909> on<00:01:16.090> the

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
how much that has to be done on the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.389 
how much that has to be done on the
retrofit<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:17.229> have<00:01:17.440> decided<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:18.040> keep<00:01:18.220> it

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
retrofit we have decided to keep it

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.850 
retrofit we have decided to keep it
indoors<00:01:18.850> because<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.479> space<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.470> outside

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
indoors because the space on the outside

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.590 
indoors because the space on the outside
of<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.100> sidewalk<00:01:21.340> way<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.030> put<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.570> right

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
of the sidewalk way and put it right

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.899 
of the sidewalk way and put it right
against<00:01:23.500> this<00:01:23.680> side<00:01:24.070> wall<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.610> then

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
against this side wall and then

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.880 
against this side wall and then
inventing<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.509> through<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.899> soffit<00:01:26.350> out<00:01:26.619> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
inventing it through the soffit out to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.859 
inventing it through the soffit out to
the<00:01:27.009> outside<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:28.330> first<00:01:28.570> thing<00:01:28.690> we're<00:01:28.780> going

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
the outside so first thing we're going

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.120 
the outside so first thing we're going
to<00:01:28.929> do<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.140> going<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.320> go<00:01:29.410> ahead<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.740> remove

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
to do is going to go ahead and remove

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.249 
to do is going to go ahead and remove
the<00:01:30.429> water<00:01:30.670> heater<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:31.509> it<00:01:31.539> gives<00:01:31.690> us<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.990> chance

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
the water heater so it gives us a chance

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.080 
the water heater so it gives us a chance
to<00:01:32.350> actually<00:01:32.770> open<00:01:32.979> up<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.340> ceiling<00:01:33.670> above<00:01:33.910> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
to actually open up the ceiling above it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.090 
to actually open up the ceiling above it
to<00:01:34.390> assess<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.810> plumbing<00:01:35.229> see<00:01:35.679> what<00:01:35.830> we<00:01:35.920> can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
to assess the plumbing see what we can

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.790 
to assess the plumbing see what we can
do<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.340> actually<00:01:36.490> do<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.910> installation<00:01:43.800> now

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
do to actually do the installation now

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.499 
do to actually do the installation now
that<00:01:44.979> we<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.220> removed<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.670> gas<00:01:45.880> line<00:01:46.179> the

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
that we have removed the gas line the

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.240 
that we have removed the gas line the
water<00:01:46.720> lines<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.500> venting<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
water lines the venting and the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.370 
water lines the venting and the
earthquake<00:01:48.640> straps<00:01:48.940> now<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.509> can<00:01:49.810> lug<00:01:50.229> this

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
earthquake straps now we can lug this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.040 
earthquake straps now we can lug this
old<00:01:50.590> thing<00:01:50.770> out<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:51.009> here<00:01:54.899> opening<00:01:55.899> up<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
old thing out of here opening up the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.840 
old thing out of here opening up the
ceiling<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:56.710> assessed<00:01:57.189> that<00:01:57.399> we<00:01:57.549> can

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
ceiling we have assessed that we can

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.090 
ceiling we have assessed that we can
vent<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.299> venting<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:58.990> through<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.649> ceiling

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
vent the venting up through the ceiling

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.370 
vent the venting up through the ceiling
and<00:02:00.220> do<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.430> horizontal<00:02:01.079> termination<00:02:02.079> out<00:02:02.200> to

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
and do a horizontal termination out to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.639 
and do a horizontal termination out to
the<00:02:02.560> outside<00:02:03.630> we've<00:02:04.630> also<00:02:04.840> opened<00:02:05.020> up<00:02:05.470> the

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649
