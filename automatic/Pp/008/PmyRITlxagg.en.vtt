00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.649

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:16.280
 interesting is happening here and today 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:16.280
 us running clear sport come on the water 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.250
 take and still remove this one thing 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.750
 watch it on tv 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 professional shot professional 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.599
 rips and another thing so pure 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 amateur footage from afar 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.969
 looks like a rocket launch from space 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.969
 center per hour I turn the camera and we 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.890
 let's start watching this process until 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.190
 rocket launch left literally a couple 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190
 minutes 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.329
 we are not visible from here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 now on your screens is the most 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.750
 big say buildings in the world this building 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 where rocket is being prepared are preparing to launch 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.910
 where the shuttles used to be where them 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 prepared to launch and start 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.119
 ground slightly to the left but from here we have it 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:15.090
 we will not see we will see the launch itself already 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.950
 it's cordoned off now by helicopters 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.920
 air water just you 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 ocean space 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 a radius of several miles is blocked now 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.080
 there is a warning here about what is impossible 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 be located in the area 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 Here but it is clear it is so to say measures 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:41.210
 security before launching the rocket and so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:45.540
 less than a minute left before launch 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.509
 so before the start there are only 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.930
 few seconds already less than a minute and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.590
 Now we will see how it is 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.590
 happens 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:09.329
 now probably 20 seconds left 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.329
 now here everything went rocket went 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:34.360
 here she goes to heaven of course the camera is not 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.680
 allows my good to take it off but myself 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:47.770
 the start itself we saw here is smoking after 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:50.900
 launch smokes launch pad all 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.030
 Unfortunately, the day start and not so 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.020
 interesting night start and really 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.460
 beautiful very because at night it 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.700
 lights up lights up it all very 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.710
 strong light now should be 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.540
 should already come sound wave 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.990
 after launch, the rocket headed for 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.990
 orbit
