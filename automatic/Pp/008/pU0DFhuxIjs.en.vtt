the<00:03:48.239> settings<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.299> we<00:03:49.450> see<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.230> focus<00:03:50.590> s

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
the settings that we see on the focus s

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.940 
the settings that we see on the focus s
which<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.280> anti<00:03:51.970> shaking<00:03:52.450> setting<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:52.989> so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
which the anti shaking setting and so

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520 
which the anti shaking setting and so
it's<00:03:54.069> just<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.340> standard<00:03:54.730> 5<00:03:54.970> megapixel<00:03:55.630> camera

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
it's just a standard 5 megapixel camera

here's sort of video quality and

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.860 
here's sort of video quality and
resolution

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.410 

now<00:04:07.860> we're<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.040> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.340> compare<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.090> to

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
now we're just going to compare this to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.479 
now we're just going to compare this to
some<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> devices<00:04:10.170> available<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:11.280> get<00:04:11.400> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
some of the devices available to get the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.729 
some of the devices available to get the
radar<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.360> right<00:04:12.540> here<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.440> focus

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
radar on the right here and the focus

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.490 
radar on the right here and the focus
flash<00:04:14.010> on<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> left<00:04:14.519> ear<00:04:14.670> now<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.500> focus

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
flash on the left ear now the focus

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.550 
flash on the left ear now the focus
flash<00:04:16.829> has<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.000> AMOLED<00:04:18.510> display<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.500> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
flash has the AMOLED display and the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280 
flash has the AMOLED display and the
radar<00:04:19.859> has<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.430> super<00:04:20.850> LCD<00:04:21.329> display<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.199> you

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
radar has the super LCD display so you

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.290 
radar has the super LCD display so you
can<00:04:22.410> probably<00:04:22.590> see<00:04:22.740> where<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.729> sort<00:04:24.270> of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
can probably see where the sort of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.020 
can probably see where the sort of
amyloid<00:04:24.690> colors<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.169> little<00:04:25.620> bit<00:04:25.830> brighter<00:04:26.030> now

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
amyloid colors a little bit brighter now

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.060 
amyloid colors a little bit brighter now
flipping<00:04:27.360> knees<00:04:27.570> together<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.290> we<00:04:28.680> can<00:04:28.830> see

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
flipping knees together and we can see

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.540 
flipping knees together and we can see
that<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.550> focus<00:04:30.210> flesh<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.160> radar<00:04:32.160> seem

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
that the focus flesh and the radar seem

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.370 
that the focus flesh and the radar seem
to<00:04:32.729> be<00:04:32.850> very<00:04:32.880> similar<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.630> sort<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.960> thickness

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
to be very similar in sort of thickness

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.980 
to be very similar in sort of thickness
there<00:04:34.729> may<00:04:35.729> be<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.970> focus<00:04:36.270> flash<00:04:36.389> probably<00:04:36.960> a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
there may be the focus flash probably a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.890 
there may be the focus flash probably a
little<00:04:37.380> bit<00:04:37.530> fed-up<00:04:38.180> face<00:04:39.180> similar<00:04:39.479> devices

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
little bit fed-up face similar devices

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.469 
little bit fed-up face similar devices
here<00:04:40.260> now<00:04:40.620> both<00:04:40.860> have<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> 5<00:04:41.370> megapixel<00:04:41.580> camera

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
here now both have a 5 megapixel camera

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.200 
here now both have a 5 megapixel camera
and<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:43.560> results<00:04:44.039> of<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.280> images<00:04:44.610> are<00:04:44.760> fairly

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
and the results of the images are fairly

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.779 
and the results of the images are fairly
identical<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.110> now<00:04:47.070> one<00:04:47.340> thing<00:04:47.370> you<00:04:47.580> also

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
identical and now one thing you also

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.540 
identical and now one thing you also
notice<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.020> rear<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.680> devices<00:04:50.039> have<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
notice is the rear of the devices have a

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.990 
notice is the rear of the devices have a
metallic<00:04:51.090> fill<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.570> both<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.350> back<00:04:52.530> covers

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
metallic fill on both of the back covers

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.150 
metallic fill on both of the back covers
now<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.060> next<00:04:54.419> up<00:04:54.660> is<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.810> nokia<00:04:55.110> lumia<00:04:55.320> 800

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
now the next up is the nokia lumia 800

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.980 
now the next up is the nokia lumia 800
on<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.340> right<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:57.030> focus<00:04:57.360> flash<00:04:57.660> on<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
on the right and the focus flash on the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.950 
on the right and the focus flash on the
left<00:04:58.260> now<00:04:58.949> both<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.310> these<00:04:59.370> devices<00:04:59.760> have<00:04:59.960> 3.7

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
left now both of these devices have 3.7

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.590 
left now both of these devices have 3.7
inch<00:05:01.229> AMOLED<00:05:01.830> displays<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.510> can

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
inch AMOLED displays and so as you can

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.810 
inch AMOLED displays and so as you can
see<00:05:03.840> they're<00:05:04.050> fairly<00:05:04.380> similar<00:05:04.889> in<00:05:05.490> terms<00:05:05.669> of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
see they're fairly similar in terms of

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.840 
see they're fairly similar in terms of
size<00:05:06.090> and<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.960> terms<00:05:07.260> of<00:05:07.410> brightness<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.039> now

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
size and in terms of brightness to now

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.930 
size and in terms of brightness to now
if<00:05:08.970> we<00:05:09.120> flip<00:05:09.660> these<00:05:09.840> both<00:05:10.440> together<00:05:10.789> you<00:05:11.789> can

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
if we flip these both together you can

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.870 
if we flip these both together you can
see<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:13.139> thickness<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.310> Luna<00:05:14.729> is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
see that the thickness of the Luna is

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.450 
see that the thickness of the Luna is
probably<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.690> little<00:05:16.229> bit<00:05:16.470> thinner<00:05:16.770> on<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
probably a little bit thinner on the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.480 
probably a little bit thinner on the
Lumia<00:05:18.180> there<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.710> but<00:05:19.710> overall<00:05:20.099> they're

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
Lumia there and but overall they're

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.150 
Lumia there and but overall they're
fairly<00:05:20.729> similar<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.300> terms<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:21.750> size<00:05:22.160> now

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
fairly similar in terms of size now

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.920 
fairly similar in terms of size now
looking<00:05:23.460> at<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.729> rear<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.330> devices<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:24.900> can

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
looking at the rear the devices you can

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.690 
looking at the rear the devices you can
clearly<00:05:25.289> see<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.560> design<00:05:26.039> differences<00:05:26.400> here

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
clearly see the design differences here

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.460 
clearly see the design differences here
nokia<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.630> obviously<00:05:27.930> opted<00:05:28.289> for<00:05:28.440> the

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
nokia is obviously opted for the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.990 
nokia is obviously opted for the
all-in-one<00:05:28.800> device<00:05:29.130> where<00:05:29.460> you<00:05:29.520> can't<00:05:29.729> remove

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
all-in-one device where you can't remove

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.089 
all-in-one device where you can't remove
the<00:05:30.210> back<00:05:30.360> cover<00:05:30.389> whereas<00:05:31.320> samsung<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.860> can

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
the back cover whereas samsung you can

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.879 
the back cover whereas samsung you can
and<00:05:32.340> now<00:05:33.270> obviously<00:05:33.570> looking<00:05:33.930> at<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.470> width

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
and now obviously looking at the width

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.950 
and now obviously looking at the width
you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.610> see<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.880> bloom<00:05:36.389> is<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.599> little<00:05:36.840> bit

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
you can see the bloom is a little bit

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.890 
you can see the bloom is a little bit
wider<00:05:37.260> but<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.280> has<00:05:38.490> used<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.210> polycarbonate

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
wider but it has used the polycarbonate

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.719

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
comparison here now the focus flash on

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.800 
comparison here now the focus flash on
the<00:06:05.039> left<00:06:05.220> here<00:06:05.460> has<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.000> lot<00:06:06.240> more<00:06:06.270> vibrant

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810

colors<00:06:07.139> and<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.070> focus<00:06:08.370> feels<00:06:08.789> a<00:06:08.880> little<00:06:09.000> bit

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
colors and the focus feels a little bit

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.300 
colors and the focus feels a little bit
washed<00:06:09.300> out<00:06:09.570> now<00:06:10.410> flipping<00:06:10.710> knees<00:06:11.010> together

washed out now flipping knees together

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.490 
washed out now flipping knees together
and<00:06:11.699> we<00:06:12.180> can<00:06:12.360> sort<00:06:12.570> of<00:06:12.630> see<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:12.900> fitness<00:06:13.380> of

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
and we can sort of see the fitness of

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.709 
and we can sort of see the fitness of
the<00:06:13.560> devices<00:06:13.919> and<00:06:14.310> I<00:06:15.090> think<00:06:15.330> it's<00:06:15.419> safe<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.570> say

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
the devices and I think it's safe to say

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.360 
the devices and I think it's safe to say
that<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.140> focus<00:06:16.560> is<00:06:16.740> probably<00:06:17.039> a<00:06:17.099> little<00:06:17.219> bit

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
that the focus is probably a little bit

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.230 
that the focus is probably a little bit
thinner<00:06:17.669> there

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
thinner there

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.439 
thinner there
but<00:06:18.960> it's<00:06:19.889> obviously<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.310> bigger<00:06:20.520> device<00:06:20.880> and

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
but it's obviously the bigger device and

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.309 
but it's obviously the bigger device and
now<00:06:21.740> looking<00:06:22.740> at<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.160> real<00:06:23.370> devices<00:06:23.849> and<00:06:24.330> now

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
now looking at the real devices and now

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.920 
now looking at the real devices and now
they<00:06:25.410> both<00:06:25.650> got<00:06:25.949> 5<00:06:26.250> megapixel<00:06:27.030> cameras<00:06:27.630> on<00:06:27.810> the

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
they both got 5 megapixel cameras on the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.379 
they both got 5 megapixel cameras on the
back<00:06:28.110> here<00:06:28.349> and<00:06:29.220> we<00:06:29.340> got<00:06:29.490> a<00:06:29.520> plastic<00:06:30.180> backing

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
back here and we got a plastic backing

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.879 
back here and we got a plastic backing
on<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.750> original<00:06:31.110> focus<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:31.860> focus

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
on the original focus and the focus

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.400 
on the original focus and the focus
speciality<00:06:32.729> got<00:06:32.910> metallic<00:06:33.449> back<00:06:34.050> in<00:06:34.229> and<00:06:34.380> now

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
speciality got metallic back in and now

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.850 
speciality got metallic back in and now
the<00:06:35.310> focus<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.910> a<00:06:35.970> wider<00:06:36.810> and<00:06:37.139> but<00:06:37.590> probably

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
the focus is a wider and but probably

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.140 
the focus is a wider and but probably
due<00:06:38.039> to<00:06:38.069> the<00:06:38.370> 4-inch<00:06:39.150> display<00:06:39.479> there<00:06:40.970> okay<00:06:41.970> any

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
due to the 4-inch display there okay any

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.210 
due to the 4-inch display there okay any
final<00:06:42.180> comparison<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.169> between<00:06:43.199> the<00:06:43.590> focus<00:06:44.069> s

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
final comparison is between the focus s

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.129 
final comparison is between the focus s
on<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.580> right<00:06:44.789> the<00:06:45.150> original<00:06:45.599> focus<00:06:45.930> in<00:06:46.050> the

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.809 
middle and the focus flash on the left
now<00:06:48.930> you<00:06:49.020> can<00:06:49.169> see<00:06:49.410> the<00:06:49.830> focus<00:06:50.370> in<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.550> middle

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
now you can see the focus in the middle

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.640 
now you can see the focus in the middle
here<00:06:50.849> has<00:06:51.210> got<00:06:51.479> sort<00:06:51.780> of<00:06:51.840> washed<00:06:51.990> out<00:06:52.229> colors
