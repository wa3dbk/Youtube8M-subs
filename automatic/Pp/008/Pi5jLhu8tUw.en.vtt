so it's like B than Y you know the tap B
then<00:01:24.840> Y<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.439> after<00:01:26.869> sometimes<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> works

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
then Y right after sometimes it works

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.149

as you can see it in working with this

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
as you can see it in working with this
