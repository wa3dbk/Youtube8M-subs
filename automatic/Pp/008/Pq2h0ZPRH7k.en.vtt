00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 mr miami farmer hello welcome to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 the farm welcome on coco tv 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.730
 today I present you a helmet 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.980
 the lines both ranges dias range 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 dias you know it's a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.859
 builder who has the will to 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.300
 take root who tried to do it by 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.950
 via a mouse in one stroke 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
 life we tested the mouse 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.820
 were moderately successful however 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.379
 the keyboard in my opinion rather frankly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.760
 well done that offered small 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.530
 technical characteristics quite 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 interesting so if you do not know 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.329
 I invite you to read the test 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 Hermes a good keyboard in my opinion 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.410
 the files all so Vulcan at the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.629
 romans a helmet that is provided to us 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 in terms of bundle with the guide of 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.379
 quick start and doubles 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.420
 keep stickers accompanies each 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 product game dias gamia is always done 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.720
 the effort to propose an aesthetic that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.460
 out of the ordinary 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 it is also a risk but a will 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.780
 to stand out for the coup so we have 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.520
 ear buds that you will find that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.200
 looks to my senses it may be a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 little bit to the millenium falcon some 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 share 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.920
 the subjects are rather nice of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.659
 slightly smooth and shiny plastic that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 is not very good but who is not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 clearly not cheap either at the level 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 the finish is ok are more 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.689
 since we find in two little ones 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 ajmal burrs handle themselves here and it's a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.409
 little marked in transport by 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.729
 there then it is largely compensated by 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.799
 employment in a much more 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.680
 noble the leather prison which is enough 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.390
 rare on the side of the four gamers so at 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.240
 headphone level in itself we have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.710
 so a very wide arch whole 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.659
 completely covered with very foam 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.280
 flexible and therefore or covered with leather 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.759
 gray madjiguene dias on the outside the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
 settings are plastic strips 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.630
 graduated quite steep is no problem 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 it breathes well the solidity is nothing to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.229
 say as you have seen since it is 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
 move a little bit in every way 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.959
 the heroes of the esj atria are 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.950
 faded on a bracket it 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.629
 even pivotally mounted 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.310
 you can find badges and 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.250
 faith all with a big two hammer 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 sides on one side and the other 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 the headset itself 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.530
 call to a semicircular window 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.280
 translucent that will allow to leave 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.380
 switch from the pretty color the logo range 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.550
 also read translucent and 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.590
 will let go of color then a 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.360
 little lack of homogeneity since we are going 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.019
 see red or yellow here 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.250
 forgiveness and vice versa the flashy setaci a 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.640
 little reminder of black locks on 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.769
 the front very specific cutting 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 suggests one of the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.390
 technical characteristics this 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.340
 particular of the game diasse file all to 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.810
 know the presence of a radiator we have 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.170
 read to dissipate the heat generated 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.209
 by the magnets on the inside we go 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.860
 find a covered atrium 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.299
 of leather with a very very soft foam 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.730
 and a small acoustic canvas at the bottom 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.049
 on the other side we will find a 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.269
 microphone boom in three parts 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.090
 soft rubber plastics so as to 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.510
 able to adapt it to his face and the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.459
 micro hosted in the terminal 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.139
 the braided cable arrives on a 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.150
 remote control that carries the second 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.680
 small imperfection know that the button 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.920
 Here you see if you do not have 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.930
 law 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.579
 he was on the presentations so 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.380
 this is the button that will allow 2015 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.660
 micros small circular windows 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.250
 translucent which will be united minera of yellow 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.920
 or red depending on the activation 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.319
 or not the microphone and a short button the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.709
 pardon slider to go down the 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.389
 volume on the side a little button that 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.190
 will allow to mutate the general volume 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.829
 in the back we will find a small 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.620
 clip for the cre made at the tie and 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.010
 it ends with your life a keyboard 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.090
 a forgiveness usb excuse me gold plated 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.090
 so 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.519
 the guen dias and five all on cowcotland 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.050
 frozen already worn a little bit I have not 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.879
 still draw all the quintessence that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.129
 I can tell you is that at the level 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.230
 technique I'm going to ask another 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.510
 buddy the zodiac knight blur 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.400
 to help us is a helmet that offers 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.370
 a spectrum coverage of 20 before 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.630
 pays him a sensitivity to 117 baby on 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.880
 an impedance of 32 ohms 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.410
 what else do you say about not much of 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.570
 particularly interesting day 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.729
 would give the numbers plus the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.290
 more encrypted details in the written test 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.600
 what I can tell you is that I 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.880
 I'm already going to sound level 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.900
 all in all relatively correct it is 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.970
 maybe not the eye fi but it's not 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.020
 unpleasant range dias made the choice 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.419
 date of adding a species of 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.970
 vibrations to indicate side cac 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.610
 came the shots where the explosions in 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.050
 function of the right spatialization 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.789
 left 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.889
 the only problem is that if the idea on 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.380
 the paper and sympathetic personally 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.690
 so that's really it will not do 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.490
 not quite subjective so it will be 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630
 not a final judgment is 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.700
 categorical in any case personally 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.650
 I did not necessarily appreciate this 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.450
 small aspect because it generates a 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.560
 kind of a buzz that I have not 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.340
 found pleasant in the ear while 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.139
 simply because in fact it's one 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.210
 membrane that acts as vibration 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.010
 so it really generates some 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.360
 thing of the order of the buzz so 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.789
 not necessarily very nice for the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.440
 remain at the level of restitution 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.300
 relatively quality is not the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.139
 big challenge but this being it's rather 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.520
 nice 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.840
 one of those great big highlights 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.639
 because it really deserves 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.770
 to be told is that it's a headset 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.389
 extremely comfortable there really 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.370
 nothing to say the presence of leather is everything 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.830
 just and justified 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.780
 it really changes it's a beautiful 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.270
 charentaise à oreille is unmistakable 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.740
 so it was the Cephise green gamm 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.880
 all for the price I did not want because 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.680
 that I do not have them in mind that I 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.080
 will give in the written test the queues 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.000
 both ranges mass on cowcotland 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.710
 I invite you to read the test 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.240
 writing that will appear soon and 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.530
 I wish you a very good day 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.530
 with us and say goodbye 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.080
 in miami farmer and farmer friends 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.030
 hello I come back I forgot to 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.380
 plug in I had planned I had prepared 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.840
 all the necessary material 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.340
 indeed some readers have wanted in 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.930
 any case trace the information as 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.230
 what he would have liked us 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.780
 present the connected products for 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.610
 visualize Christmas illuminations 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.990
 it's almost the period so that's what 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.400
 that it gives on a touch ace you 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.680
 say yellow and red 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.780
 there I have a lot of light because I 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.150
 am in the photo studio obviously that 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.470
 does a little bit less than what 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.020
 sap is actually in the office but 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.730
 it's pretty weak not necessarily missed 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.800
 a far from it is even rather successful 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.420
 I stay rather for the homogeneity 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.010
 so I would have preferred that both 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.350
 first be the same but it remains 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.440
 totally subjective and everyone will see 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.800
 lunch at his door so it was the queues 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.700
 all lit up and this time 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.850
 backlighting en route on 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.260
 cowcotland.com so I tell you to 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.940
 soon and I wish you a good 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.090
 day but I had already done go to 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.090
 meet again
