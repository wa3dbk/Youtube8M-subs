the<00:00:16.410> recipe<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.100> easy<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.789> actually

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the recipe is really easy it actually

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.920 
the recipe is really easy it actually
only<00:00:18.449> has<00:00:18.750> flour<00:00:19.050> sugar<00:00:19.500> eggs<00:00:20.369> milk<00:00:21.000> honey<00:00:21.570> and

only has flour sugar eggs milk honey and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
only has flour sugar eggs milk honey and
the<00:00:22.920> baking<00:00:23.279> soda<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.760> baking<00:00:23.880> powder<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the baking soda and baking powder if you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
the baking soda and baking powder if you
use<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> self-rising<00:00:26.010> flour<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.910> omit

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
use the self-rising flour you can omit

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019 
use the self-rising flour you can omit
the<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.019> baking<00:00:28.320> powder<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.769> baking<00:00:29.220> soda<00:00:29.429> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the the baking powder and baking soda I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
the the baking powder and baking soda I
actually<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.779> using<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.859> but

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
actually like using that one but

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
actually like using that one but
apparently<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.510> buy<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> flour<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
apparently if you buy the flour with the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
apparently if you buy the flour with the
baking<00:00:35.100> soda<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.880> baking<00:00:36.300> powder<00:00:36.480> mixed<00:00:37.140> in

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
baking soda and baking powder mixed in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.380 
baking soda and baking powder mixed in
it's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.640> expensive<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it's a little bit more expensive so it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
it's a little bit more expensive so it
depends<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.899> which<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.950> which

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
depends on which one you have and which

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
depends on which one you have and which
one<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> more<00:00:42.300> convenient<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.100> normally

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
one is more convenient for you normally

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.319 
one is more convenient for you normally
I<00:00:44.129> would<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.730> self-rising<00:00:45.300> flour

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I would use the self-rising flour

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
I would use the self-rising flour
because<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> easier<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
because just because it's easier so you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.569 
because just because it's easier so you
need<00:00:47.910> 1<00:00:48.149> cup<00:00:48.329> flour<00:00:48.539> 1/2<00:00:49.350> cup<00:00:49.379> sugar<00:00:49.620> baking

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
need 1 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar baking

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.720 
need 1 cup flour 1/2 cup sugar baking
powder<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> baking<00:00:51.270> soda<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
powder and baking soda for put in the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.560 
powder and baking soda for put in the
flour<00:00:54.199> or<00:00:55.199> eggs<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.730> happen<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

one in the gallon jugs probably can't

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.370 
one in the gallon jugs probably can't
taste<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> difference<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:13.049> they're<00:01:13.229> so

on<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.830> tin<00:05:04.280> tape<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.240> want<00:05:05.539> to<00:05:05.630> consume

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
on a tin tape so you want to consume

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.189 
on a tin tape so you want to consume
this<00:05:06.349> within<00:05:07.070> about<00:05:07.310> 2<00:05:07.669> or<00:05:07.699> 3<00:05:08.150> days<00:05:08.360> there's<00:05:09.020> no

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
preservatives and it so it tends to not

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.020 
preservatives and it so it tends to not
taste<00:05:11.810> as<00:05:12.020> good<00:05:12.199> after<00:05:12.440> 2<00:05:12.800> or<00:05:12.830> 3<00:05:13.099> days<00:05:13.280> you<00:05:13.880> can

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
taste as good after 2 or 3 days you can
