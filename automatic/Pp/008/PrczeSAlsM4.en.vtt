welcome back settling here when you were
a<00:00:02.879> kid<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.120> might<00:00:03.330> have<00:00:03.419> played<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.750> game<00:00:03.990> the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
a kid you might have played the game the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.650 
a kid you might have played the game the
floor<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.069> hot<00:00:05.460> lava<00:00:05.700> or<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.210> floor<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.509> lava

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
floor is hot lava or the floor is lava

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.700 
floor is hot lava or the floor is lava
or<00:00:06.960> whatever<00:00:08.480> where<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.750> try<00:00:10.290> not<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> touch

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
or whatever where you try not to touch

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.830 
or whatever where you try not to touch
the<00:00:10.889> floor<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.880> floor<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.360> made<00:00:12.599> out

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the floor because the floor is made out

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.030 
the floor because the floor is made out
of<00:00:13.019> burning<00:00:13.290> hot<00:00:13.500> lava

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
of burning hot lava

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
of burning hot lava
so<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.030> decided<00:00:15.839> why<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.230> bring<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.220> kids

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
so I decided why not bring that kids

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.269 
so I decided why not bring that kids
game<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.480> Minecraft<00:00:18.930> wrote<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> little<00:00:20.070> filter

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
game to Minecraft wrote a little filter

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.080 
game to Minecraft wrote a little filter
mcedit

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
mcedit

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.220 
mcedit
and<00:00:22.609> it<00:00:23.609> basically<00:00:24.210> makes<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> game<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> whole

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and it basically makes the game a whole

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
and it basically makes the game a whole
lot<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.710> challenging<00:00:26.369> as<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
lot more challenging as you can see I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.830 
lot more challenging as you can see I
spawned<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> forest<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.420> it's<00:00:30.420> all<00:00:30.630> burning

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
spawned in a forest and it's all burning

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780 
spawned in a forest and it's all burning
up<00:00:31.019> around<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.679> don't<00:00:32.189> even<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.610> any

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
up around me I don't even have any

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
up around me I don't even have any
blocks<00:00:33.030> luckily<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.140> did<00:00:34.320> spawn<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> little

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
blocks luckily I did spawn on a little

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.440 
blocks luckily I did spawn on a little
platform<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:36.090> part<00:00:36.420> of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
platform here that's actually part of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.500 
platform here that's actually part of
the<00:00:36.570> filter<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.800> player<00:00:38.180> any<00:00:39.180> players

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the filter that the player any players

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
the filter that the player any players
will<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> platform<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.710> spawns

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
will have a platform that spawns

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.580 
will have a platform that spawns
underneath<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> little

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
underneath them so I can make a little

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
underneath them so I can make a little
dirt<00:00:44.160> quarry<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:45.899> try<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.460> gather<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.410> how<00:00:49.410> do

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
dirt quarry to try and gather so how do

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.549 
dirt quarry to try and gather so how do
they<00:00:50.000> gather<00:00:51.000> some<00:00:51.300> dirts<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.079> maybe

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
they gather some dirts that I can maybe

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
they gather some dirts that I can maybe
make<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:52.949> way<00:00:53.100> over<00:00:53.129> grab<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> tree<00:00:53.910> or

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
make my way over grab a tree or

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.910 
make my way over grab a tree or
something

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
something

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
something
now<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.340> lava<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.879> only<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.360> block<00:00:57.629> thick<00:00:57.989> so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
now the lava is only one block thick so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.539 
now the lava is only one block thick so
I<00:00:59.180> can<00:01:00.180> actually<00:01:03.799> I<00:01:05.330> can't<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:07.549> place

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
I can actually I can't actually place

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
I can actually I can't actually place
blocks<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
blocks down right here but you need the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.700 
blocks down right here but you need the
blocks<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> place<00:01:11.610> first<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.310> yeah<00:01:14.310> yeah

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
blocks to place first and yeah yeah

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
blocks to place first and yeah yeah
let's<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.909> wooden

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
let's see if I can get some some wooden

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
let's see if I can get some some wooden
stuff<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:19.650> very<00:01:19.890> challenging

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
stuff it's just a very very challenging

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.320 
stuff it's just a very very challenging
game<00:01:21.090> mode<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.920> obviously<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.939> don't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
game mode because obviously you don't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.789 
game mode because obviously you don't
really<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:25.170> any<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> getting

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
really have any good way of getting

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
really have any good way of getting
around<00:01:26.159> okay<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.210> point<00:01:29.420> five<00:01:30.420> percent

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
around okay so this point five percent

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.330 
around okay so this point five percent
there<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.439> point<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.979> actually<00:01:32.009> start

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
there this point I can actually start

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.120 
there this point I can actually start
gathering<00:01:32.759> some<00:01:32.970> wood<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.710> maybe<00:01:34.710> even<00:01:34.890> make

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
gathering some wood and maybe even make

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
gathering some wood and maybe even make
a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.720> stone<00:01:36.720> quarry<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> stuff<00:01:37.590> anyway
