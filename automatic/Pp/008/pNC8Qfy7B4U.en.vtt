00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.760
 they have half a dozen clear occasions 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 yes, we are happy in that 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.480
 plot the team with their problems of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 tiredness and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.039
 of a lot of training and with less 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.220
 baggage that the rival has presented 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.410
 before the goalkeeper more than three times and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 also clear occasions good 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.579
 we are happy that means that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.400
 So far we have done well and in what 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 others then to continue working is 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 Of course we have a lot of work for 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.089
 in front of me no longer the team that scares me 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 has received a goal does not give you the 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.030
 back to the party still keeps doing 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.070
 the same and good, little by little it will go 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.070
 more did not work out 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 because it has cost us a little bit another 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 he thinks that we have had to put a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
 player who played 90 minutes on the day 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.619
 earlier that we are all a little 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 worried because we did not have very clear 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.710
 what happened to him 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.810
 but good 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 we already know what is harm gives us a 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.640
 Baggage of aggressiveness of having the ball 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.550
 the game is well associated with the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.290
 colleagues and of course we have lost 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.020
 danny's exit until the end of the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.350
 until the rest alone the hairs 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.040
 team minutes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 a strong sprain on the other foot is not 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.759
 the same as the one you saw in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.500
 the training and good as we started 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 to train on Tuesday to see if so 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.140
 less to Tuesday's training by the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 I could start late 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.630
 well I 've seen and german pezzella more 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.780
 strong I've seen more sure it's true that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.640
 gives us security a little curiously the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.640
 fact that alfred is in the field 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.990
 also that he has played with discomfort 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.099
 final we had to remove 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.050
 and well, we have to continue 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.910
 managing things so that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.450
 defects are not visible to us and that's what 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.450
 we have to do 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.870
 if it's one of the things I wanted 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.080
 prove that we are not able to do 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.510
 different causes the try with three 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.000
 up and three up with 'Jorge the only 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.100
 way is Jorge inside not so 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 rubÃ©n is handled well there makes good 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.820
 Diagonal is a player that deals damage 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.880
 from that site 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.470
 let's see we have as I said 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.010
 three games from here to the end for 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.010
 approve
