00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
can see that it might be slightly

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
can see that it might be slightly
forgiving<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> well<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:28.950> really<00:01:29.070> set<00:01:29.369> up

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
forgiving as well but it's really set up

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
forgiving as well but it's really set up

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
to be worn with the belt again it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440
