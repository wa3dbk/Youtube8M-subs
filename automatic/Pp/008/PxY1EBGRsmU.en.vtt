00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everybody, I'm the marx 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.940
 I would like to leave the tip today about 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 this little bug here 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 simply to help but mostly 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 of the times it ends up leaving people with 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 fear of nothing good 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.850
 do not be afraid it's just for you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.320
 help make less effort 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.400
 the basic tips on the microphone are 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.840
 every time you went to sing a note 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.250
 low volume together at the time of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 a strong sharp note with plenty of volume 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 away from some microphones that pick up 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 voice in several directions further to the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 more down but up 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.539
 other microphones not if you do not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.800
 positioning a certain place it will not 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.410
 do the capture 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 so study before using the microphone 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.160
 to understand how to capture it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.180
 it's happening because it's going to 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.379
 mess up while you are 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 singing 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.159
 if you're the type to rehearse on 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.700
 some studio that's going to sing in church 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.710
 who does a show in some bar and is disgusted with 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
 using the microphone is available there 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 Do you have your own microphone? 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.330
 This is the best tip for a singer. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 professional if you have yours will not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.570
 have this problem with hygiene because 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.479
 Do you know who you're dealing with? 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 and it is common for this cleaning 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.829
 of the microphone daily 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 Now the microphones out there or 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.659
 always happens that care 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.119
 so if you have a problem with 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 have your microphone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.119
 this is the best way to start 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 practice with it and lost the fear of using 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.799
 this microphone every time you went 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.979
 sing then basically what you 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 You need to think of a low grade with little 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.020
 volume 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.899
 join the sharp note with strength and volume 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.719
 and then you will and you will have that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.759
 parameter of how much to 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.759
 join if you're going to sing something like 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:19.120
 hey, who are you going to work with? 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.189
 distance 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.500
 If you're singing, this is it. 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.239
 happening a lot is because with 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.120
 Are you sure you're leaving the microphone? 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.430
 far ahead the lab pushes away a 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.310
 little and leaves more or less in the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.319
 direction than a minimum distance 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.120
 we use as a rule four of them 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.310
 does not need much more than that 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.859
 leave it here in the direction of the chin 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.470
 four drawings and there goes a job 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.139
 farther away to avoid 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.859
 pouf basically it does not have much 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.780
 secret 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.359
 the business is you start to use to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.879
 get a little practice starts to 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.879
 use is for you to improve your vowel
