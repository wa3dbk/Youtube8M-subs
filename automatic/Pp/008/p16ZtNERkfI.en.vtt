what you see on the screen right now is

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.220 
what you see on the screen right now is
a<00:00:10.349> program<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.099> wrote<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.610> Visual<00:00:12.120> Basic

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
a program that I wrote in Visual Basic

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.460 
a program that I wrote in Visual Basic
Express<00:00:13.580> 2008<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.540> doing<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.199> it's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
Express 2008 what it's doing is it's

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
Express 2008 what it's doing is it's
checking<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.220> position<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.119> Hall

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
checking the position that to Hall

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
checking the position that to Hall
effect<00:00:18.660> sensors<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.710> reporting<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.430> those

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
effect sensors are reporting and those

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.950 
effect sensors are reporting and those
Hall<00:00:20.730> effect<00:00:20.880> sensors<00:00:21.449> are<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:21.930> on

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
Hall effect sensors are right here on

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
Hall effect sensors are right here on
this<00:00:22.230> breadboard<00:00:22.699> it's<00:00:23.699> checking<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
this breadboard it's checking the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
this breadboard it's checking the
position<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.840> those<00:00:25.019> sensors<00:00:25.500> report<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
position that those sensors report and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.660 
position that those sensors report and
then<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.150> plotting<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.810> dot<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.800> form

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
then it's plotting a dot in this form

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
then it's plotting a dot in this form
right<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> screen<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> see

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
right here on the screen that you see

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
right here on the screen that you see
and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> dots<00:00:31.769> moving<00:00:32.369> around<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.090> bit

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and the dots moving around a little bit

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.060 
and the dots moving around a little bit
simply<00:00:33.780> because<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> sensors<00:00:34.680> tend<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
simply because the sensors tend to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
simply because the sensors tend to
produce<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.790> noise<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:37.140> idle<00:00:37.530> State

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
produce a little noise in an idle State

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
produce a little noise in an idle State
so<00:00:38.690> with<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> neodymium<00:00:40.410> magnet<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.030> one

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so with a neodymium magnet like this one

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
so with a neodymium magnet like this one
it's<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> half<00:00:43.410> inch<00:00:43.590> across<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it's about a half inch across by a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
it's about a half inch across by a
half-inch<00:00:44.700> around<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.170> hold<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
half-inch around if I just hold this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
half-inch around if I just hold this
magnet<00:00:47.520> above<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.360> sensors<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> sensor

magnet above my sensors in the sensor
the<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.980> black<00:00:50.250> specks<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.390> on

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the little black specks you see there on

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.100 
the little black specks you see there on
the<00:00:51.539> board

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the board

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.610 
the board
I<00:00:52.250> can<00:00:53.250> cause<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.850> dot<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.809> move<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I can cause this dot to move on the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.970 
I can cause this dot to move on the
screen<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:56.250> real<00:00:56.309> time<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.829> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
screen in real time as you can see it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
screen in real time as you can see it's
pretty<00:00:59.190> sensitive<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> fact<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.660> fairly

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
pretty sensitive and in fact it's fairly

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
pretty sensitive and in fact it's fairly
easy<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.379> control<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.100> move<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> each

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
easy to control I can move to each

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.630 
easy to control I can move to each
corner<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.189> Center<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
corner and and I can Center it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
corner and and I can Center it
relatively<00:01:06.360> easily<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> sides<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
relatively easily and to the sides and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.210 
relatively easily and to the sides and
make<00:01:10.710> circles<00:01:11.040> things<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
make circles things like that as you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
make circles things like that as you can
see<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> movement<00:01:15.509> I'm<00:01:15.780> not

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
see to get that kind of movement I'm not

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.450 
see to get that kind of movement I'm not
moving<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.400> a

op amps and made by analog devices in
fact<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> microcontroller<00:01:48.329> right

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
fact and then this microcontroller right

here<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> mega<00:01:50.299> 168<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.430> just

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
here is a mega 168 and then this is just

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
here is a mega 168 and then this is just
a<00:01:54.030> hex<00:01:54.390> inverter<00:01:54.659> chip<00:01:55.290> right<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
a hex inverter chip right here so that I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.359

drivers<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:01.170> actual<00:02:01.530> microcontroller<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
drivers the actual microcontroller is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.940 
drivers the actual microcontroller is
communicating<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.479> computer<00:02:03.950> through

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
communicating with my computer through

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.160 
communicating with my computer through
it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.119> USB<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.290> serial<00:02:07.459> emulator<00:02:09.170> which

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's a USB to serial emulator which

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.590 
it's a USB to serial emulator which
basically<00:02:10.979> looks<00:02:11.280> too

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
basically looks too

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.730 
basically looks too
computer<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> third<00:02:12.740> comport<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.620> it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
computer like a third comport and it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.140 
computer like a third comport and it
just<00:02:15.950> runs<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.060> the

just runs right in here to the
microcontroller<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
microcontroller and then the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.400 
microcontroller and then the
microcontroller<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:20.150> basically<00:02:20.810> answering

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
microcontroller is basically answering

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.360 
microcontroller is basically answering
the<00:02:21.650> computers<00:02:22.220> query<00:02:22.870> for<00:02:23.870> whatever<00:02:24.710> port<00:02:25.160> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
the computers query for whatever port I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.420 
the computers query for whatever port I
asked<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.850> computer<00:02:26.300> sends<00:02:26.720> out<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.430> request

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
asked the computer sends out a request

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.090 
asked the computer sends out a request
for<00:02:28.700> which<00:02:29.060> channel<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> sample<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
for which channel to sample and then the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.130 
for which channel to sample and then the
microcontroller<00:02:31.610> checks<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.540> channel<00:02:32.960> that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
microcontroller checks the channel that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.530 
microcontroller checks the channel that
that<00:02:33.290> sensor<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.800> associated<00:02:34.610> with<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.030> then

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
that sensor is associated with and then

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.950 
that sensor is associated with and then
sends<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.170> value<00:02:36.590> back<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.130> computer<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
sends the value back to the computer and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.690 
sends the value back to the computer and
then<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.080> computer<00:02:39.380> takes<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.980> value<00:02:40.430> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
then the computer takes that value and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.360 
then the computer takes that value and
updates<00:02:41.420> either<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.900> X<00:02:42.080> or<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.350> y<00:02:42.590> coordinate

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
updates either the X or the y coordinate

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.540 
updates either the X or the y coordinate
of<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.700> point<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.210> screen<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.620> hopefully

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
of the point on the screen so hopefully

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.890 
of the point on the screen so hopefully
I'll<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.850> some<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.060> updates<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.750> this

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
I'll have some more updates on this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.550 
I'll have some more updates on this
project<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.710> go<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.730> add<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.150> actual

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
project as I go and as I add the actual

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.420 
project as I go and as I add the actual
electromagnets<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.740> hopefully<00:02:52.220> get<00:02:52.400> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
electromagnets and hopefully get a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.880 
electromagnets and hopefully get a
feedback<00:02:52.910> system<00:02:53.180> set<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.380> can<00:02:54.680> hold

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
feedback system set up so I can hold

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.130 
feedback system set up so I can hold
this<00:02:55.160> little<00:02:55.490> magnet<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.240> equilibrium<00:02:57.020> with

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
this little magnet in equilibrium with

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.400 
this little magnet in equilibrium with
gravity<00:02:57.740> in<00:02:57.920> any<00:02:58.760> kind<00:02:59.060> of<00:02:59.180> orientation<00:02:59.810> that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
gravity in any kind of orientation that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.250 
gravity in any kind of orientation that
the<00:03:00.560> system<00:03:00.980> should<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.430> so<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:03.080> see

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the system should be in so you can see

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.200 
the system should be in so you can see
the<00:03:03.380> dot<00:03:03.620> will<00:03:03.800> move<00:03:04.010> around<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.490> screen

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.370 

there<00:03:08.210> we<00:03:08.330> go

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.480 

so<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:14.490> for<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:14.850> update<00:03:15.180> soon
