tend to like these nice big thicker
ribbons<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.660> give

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
ribbons just because I think they give

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.709 
ribbons just because I think they give
it<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.469> pretty<00:00:40.710> presentation<00:00:41.510> but<00:00:42.510> any

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
any size any size and kind will work

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
any size any size and kind will work
just<00:00:46.140> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> depends<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.010> preference

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so again you just thread it through the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
so again you just thread it through the
inner<00:00:49.649> slot<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:51.000> down<00:00:51.030> through

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
inner slot and then back down through

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.520 
inner slot and then back down through
the<00:00:51.510> outer<00:00:51.539> slot<00:00:52.280> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> buckle<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
