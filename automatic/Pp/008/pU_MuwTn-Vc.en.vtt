00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 good morning friends and subscribers of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.179
 youtube first of all I want to give them 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.519
 thanks to whom twitter 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 please names that are understood 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 who twitter who was the one who made us 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.449
 the label let's say we label 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 in this tweet that you see that it is fast what 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.180
 did it be the tweet he just sent 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 win-win with and I'll explain it now the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.560
 video and everything but look how fast he is 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.219
 comes and made us the label so that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.219
 we both support fernando 5 x 18 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.040
 we saw it and see the importance of this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 and I said why not who is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.070
 sending the tweet first but 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:55.710
 we go first with the logo and with the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.300
 news is ios 7.1 a tester wood ok and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.859
 there's the video the video we're just going to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.570
 put in an article by Martian font 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.579
 for you to see it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 there's the video guys and the video that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.360
 is essentially showing what it is 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.610
 what the simple video shows 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.670
 an iphone4 that is still around 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 determine if it's 4 or 4 s I think that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.049
 marta told me marta I forgot my not that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.390
 is a 4 s analyzed the video because of the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 stripes that are achieved see you go to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 see later in the video but what 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.360
 important here it is that this deception is 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.820
 7.1 and that the jailbreak that is in the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.790
 process that is being shown there is that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.060
 is being the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.860
 home is starting with a jailbreak 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.540
 miner there is where the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 morffes keys I do not know I do not remember 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.260
 what's that called but it looks like the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.420
 iphone starts 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.520
 without the need to connect it to the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 computer without the need to do 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.080
 nothing but the most important thing is who 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.900
 is sending this tweet what is 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 sending win to as you know who 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.050
 is that guy 45 thousand followers a guy 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.570
 that is one of the jailbreak is of the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.520
 of the big ones in the in the image now 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.700
 of the great ones who are now so 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.890
 it is important because of who 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.090
 is sending it credibility is given to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 that and the title of the tweet that says 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.190
 ios 71.1 ante ter bots 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.080
 what does that mean for us and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.880
 because the video does not show silvia 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.040
 I know there he is already as you can see 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.500
 is trying to show who is in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.290
 ios 7 who is showing this 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.090
 I think it 's the I think that's the channel 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.880
 of him even if he does not have so many followers 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 but he says he says on a twitter it's 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.800
 putting here that he really did not want 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.330
 send this video but sent it and what 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.580
 does this mean for us ok what 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.800
 what he is showing is that the phone 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.380
 has jailbreak you have no idea because 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.290
 Boys 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.510
 he had told them for a long time 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 jailbreak time and syria are two things 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.190
 completely different I'm not going to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.900
 tired of saying it clearly that to achieve 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.340
 you have to make the break for 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.560
 install yes you have to have the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.080
 jerry but it does not mean that the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.810
 jailbreak is exactly install cydia 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.610
 the jbic allows you to install if from asia 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.680
 it is an application that can not be 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.880
 installed unless you have the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.620
 boil because I can make a 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.110
 application now and put them idea and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.940
 send it to the appo story and that the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.650
 accept that is the name of the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.440
 application but it's not about the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 resources Syria uses and that's why 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.770
 it can not be installed unless you 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.290
 ios yerbal have 711 ter wood as 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.090
 you already have this device you already have the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.100
 boil it will be necessary to put them and to bind the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.560
 old man's question so much needed 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.630
 to put Syria and the whole process 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.700
 because you know that we already have the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.860
 boil clear we have to carry cidh already 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.200
 we're not going to do anything semi cydia or 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.760
 something can be done but it is very difficult 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.770
 for the user who already the device 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.840
 It is open but we have not installed it 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.170
 silvia in this case I see it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.390
 very different to ios 7 when we went from 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:10.709
 ios 6 ios 7 because the 7.1 is the same 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.989
 process is the same ios 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.610
 7.0 only with the update and 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.650
 here it has just been shown that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.600
 we have the vulnerability is I hope 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.060
 that part of you understand there that 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.889
 it happened with a year of 67 you guys saw 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.320
 that the jailbreak came out and it was not ready 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.300
 and it is not there and there were thousands of criticisms 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.949
 criticizing the jailbreak I think 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.450
 that because they take it out if it's not ready that 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.090
 the money that this that that does not guys 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.130
 is that you look and you can see the strip of 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.070
 iphone there is given we realize that it is 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.710
 an iphone 4s guys what happens is that 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.169
 when they took the xerez for me from 7 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.990
 they are taking out the jailbreak for the first 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.960
 once guys first time in a system 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.850
 different ios ios 7 though for you 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.760
 you see it I said you say or 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.580
 they changed some few little things are 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.190
 looks pretty and this at the programming level 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.650
 at the level of hacking at the level of 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.270
 jailbreak is a totally change 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.380
 different so that's why it was that 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.330
 they took 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.010
 we saw that we had the jailbreak and they had 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.540
 tweets that were not working and 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.730
 after what are the ones that are 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.610
 working that will not always happen 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.250
 it happened because of the big change we saw in 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.970
 ios 7 that even if you say that it is not a 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.850
 big change 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.910
 ios 7 is completely redesigned 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.820
 they did from the beginning ok now I'll 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.890
 I give to have the jailbreak I give it good 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.920
 this video was there we can see that it was 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.140
 made on March 16 and already are 20 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.660
 was published today March 20 well there 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.220
 where you have few visits I imagine 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.800
 how many visitors are you going to have in a few 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.950
 hours few comments but already if 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.280
 we have the possible jailbreak from that 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.860
 date or on a twitter ok in london 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.340
 since that date I do not give more 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.140
 time and already he has been doing and 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.250
 posting tweets about that the only thing 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.680
 he has not been paying much 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.350
 attention but let's see it says things 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.820
 so what brings you to think about 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.809
 that yes that is already working so 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.279
 to conclude guys 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:14.619
 21 or 22 weeks 12 weeks maximum 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:17.889
 a week already to have the jailbreaking 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:20.169
 7.1 air I also liked doing this 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.669
 video because many of you were 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.029
 asking more and we are boiled to see 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:29.739
 7.1 Many of you went up and what in 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:33.279
 I understand it and already wait every time 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:36.639
 it's more is shorter ok there's a process 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.919
 that is working is not something magical 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.599
 doing the jailbreak is not something that 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.360
 let's close our eyes let's do it 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.769
 a process is not carried and that's what 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.509
 we are seeing here and I hope that you 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:49.839
 have understood that part there we already have 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.149
 already the 7.1 cheating jailbreak is possible 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.929
 that means they found 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:56.199
 vulnerability that means that 

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:57.669
 We have the process to get to repair 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.629
 several mistakes do it a little more 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:03.969
 fast and bring syria to 7.1 that will not be 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:07.089
 the same as when we had to carry 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.050
 if from 67 that there was a lot 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.479
 work 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.819
 now it will not be so difficult so guys 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.830
 we will have jailbreak for her and 7.1 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.539
 soon we will soon be able to upload soon 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.370
 we can do what we want 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.810
 doing this has been all for this video 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.180

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.680
