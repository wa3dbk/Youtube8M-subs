00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.143
 Hello! What are you doing up here alone? 

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:10.744
 I'm looking for Zambezia. 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.746
 Far in the heart of Africa ... 

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.281
 ... a young village falcon will fly 

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.996
 to a big city. 

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.051
 The runway is free. 

00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.940
 Paradise for birds of different feathers. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.298
 Watch out for my eggs! 

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.036
 Watch where you're flying, it's forbidden! 

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:37.950
 Pardon. 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.227
 Welcome to Zambezia, the amazing city of birds! 

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:42.349
 This place is great. 

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.633
 What brings you to Zambezia? 

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.641
 I'd like to join the Hurricanes. 

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:59.495
 Hurricanes guard the sky. They provide Zambezia safety. 

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.667
 They are amazing! 

00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:05.267
 It's been some time since we had a falcon. 

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:14.587
 I know the talent when I see him. 

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.172
 You've passed the exam, you can be proud, 

00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:20.263
 that you are now a job seeker for Hurricanes. 

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:23.853
 Maribe's Invasion! 

00:01:23.853 --> 00:01:26.834
 But survival isn't just birds ... 

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.286
 How many eggs are you still willing to eat? 

00:01:30.286 --> 00:01:31.002
 I have you! 

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:32.944
 In a city that's used to winning, 

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.422
 must Kai come up with a plan ... 

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:39.771
 Here's something for your eyes! 

00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:41.561
 ... which will bring peace to the earth. 

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.130
 I can't believe you got me here! 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.592
 I'm allergic to danger! 

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:49.087
 Look what you did! Now he will destroy Zambezia! 

00:01:49.087 --> 00:01:51.624
 If we stick together, we can win! 

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:52.825
 Go for it? 

00:01:54.893 --> 00:01:56.203
 ABIGAIL BRESLINOVÁ 

00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.290
 Do you know how long we worked on it? 

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:00.468
 Catch it! 

00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:02.450
 JEFF GOLDBLUM 

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.823
 And here we have a big swamp. 

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:07.740
 Who made a spot on my map? 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.693
 LEONARD NIMOY 

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:11.958
 - We have to fight together! - Where are the Hurricanes? 

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.056
 Without them we are helpless! 

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:16.702
 And SAMUEL L. JACKSON 

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.091
 Did something happen when I was gone? 

00:02:19.067 --> 00:02:20.386
 What is he doing? 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.712
 Welcome to the magical world ... 

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:25.893
 Shake your feathers. 

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:29.994
 Today we can say with a clear conscience 

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:32.855
 that no bird is an enemy! 

00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:38.183
 Welcome to ZAMBEZII 

00:02:38.562 --> 00:02:40.241
 You want a sticky jetty? ------------------------------ ae48c6783125--
