00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.190
 I have had the accident 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.840
 quite well trained 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.740
 a few months to go to hefty 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.970
 traffic yes friends did exercises 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.010
 what do you have so far we do 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.630
 I think there I certainly feel my 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.400
 own much fatter 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.679
 compared to last year, we are failing 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.630
 also known fats spa yes then turned 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.480
 I too little 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.859
 so yes i have a good feeling about it 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.230
 he said i am i have never seen him 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.060
 live on an ow i have a few times 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.940
 here on the train 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.019
 a few laps a Sunday yesterday 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.109
 driven 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.179
 it is corn it is yes you are behind the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.000
 with behind the wheel from behind the the 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.850
 wheels for him it's just weird 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 so have to make some mileage thinking 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.000
 to get a good feeling 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.070
 but on the other hand it 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.199
 weight distribution is well there is a super 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.140
 it is a cue heavier on the fore 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.499
 if behind the state that is me completely 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.329
 super 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.309
 we have a lot to know about 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.430
 can get down so yes 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.230
 on paper it is simply much better the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.740
 ingredients of the cars and are whole 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.750
 good 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.580
 it's just the question for me how old 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.300
 in the dunes to definitely get one 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 profession and in 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.920
 we do get chilli santander 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.050
 as that is the question here use terms 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 handling and bad speed in terms of speed 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.130
 i say lead is much better if 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 what we had 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 This is simply whether there are two 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.770
 insure how the culture is good setting 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 can find for the shock absorbers throughout 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.679
 important and feel for it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 with Jan there yes I find that very whole 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.149
 reassurance 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 it's a men with a lot of experience 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.909
 yes it is very clear in the beyond 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.200
 you want i think that's definitely one 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.079
 order is from the teams as we 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.090
 well we start sleeping with alone 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.799
 but feyenoord and others with a lot of men 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 could watch movies 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.709
 I think you definitely need someone 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.079
 I look up to everyone to yes 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.560
 the one where you one and listens 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.789
 he was definitely the person for it 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.120
 with the day of rest you can do a bit of the 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.299
 determine who 's who's strategy 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.220
 give backup with if you like 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.780
 together make the grand result 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.319
 that they would be what i massively i you 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 that just works super together and she does 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.060
 stand actual year just one the one 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.560
 two one two three or one three or them 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 just do it help way dads could 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.879
 good 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.629
 I think that's the only way and 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.370
 we have been against otherwise I have I 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.959
 I have put together their own same team and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.420
 at a bit we are in line with 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.220
 with Jan there and yes the objective was 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.290
 just very clear from the start 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.190
 how we all win so only one 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 thing is becoming 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.019
 What is clear is that I am clear 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.849
 but we must work together and if you do 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.650
 one abandons someone yes then 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.280
 then the whole team is working then you 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.079
 you just do it 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.730
 you can not get that and only docker 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.870
 to win 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 that time has passed that is no longer possible
