00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the deco you still have not felt this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.890
 I like it there in the first place because 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 when you played the last match with the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 Japanese politics took over the third 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.370
 position and now you will feel this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 inside the field wanted to talk about it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.420
 that leadership is different 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 in the essential truth because even 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.039
 being in the field recent defeat and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 win everything participates in software is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.949
 more than what's playing too much 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 I think we've had a difficult time. 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.989
 right with many injuries in sequence 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 games waiting I hope you have overcome 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 dent 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.789
 Everybody thinks I got in - I always do. 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.309
 on the nautical then it 's on the straight 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.829
 end in the approach try to help the team 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.860
 to be able to maintain that is our 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.350
 goal is to be champion is you and fred 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 together they have 81% of use and still 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.100
 they did not lose 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.469
 are seven games five wins and two 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 ties is a good pair in the world 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.590
 I think those names are everything is cool 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.369
 I think it's cool and it's part of football. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.619
 to share players and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.770
 But we do not see much of this. 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.399
 way our backs are very 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.829
 It's a lot of the group so I do not think 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.350
 sure that any player who is not 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.159
 available the paper is to make loose more 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 We always think it 's important that we 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.270
 to look at what we do as a 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.399
 full confrontation nor Fred wants to know 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 It's okay to number more power for us. 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.549
 means nothing because it is more important 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.509
 we get off the field I take the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.610
 ideas and all our work there. 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.159
 Reef did not have the fred is over or 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 less goals now maximum team strength 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.099
 is also rising production and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 games from Brazil until the end of 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.560
 one Brazilian is much more difficult than 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.599
 beginning of the first phone that is where 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.209
 world really has some that nobody 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.130
 can stay here a computer but 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.720
 Americans have not fallen 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.819
 the games are much more importance 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.769
 which is much more difficult than the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.049
 beginning of which was also in the emotional 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.599
 everybody has a bigger goal 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.590
 so there 's no way nautical and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.209
 brazilian 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.310
 the guild any people for 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.530
 play now let's go to the game with 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.950
 objective will be more complicated already 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.030
 said that we already started dancing here 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.540
 independent of the adversary we have 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.120
 always be well- connected because the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.880
 signs that leaves Jack's wife Dorsey 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.980
 the twitter where it continues now how it is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.900
 this desire to return to the countryside and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.889
 5 August and that the data 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.389
 It's interesting that you have bigger 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.889
 individual use among 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.810
 players you work did not lose 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.410
 while the two are not champions 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.840
 things for me I already missed Saturday 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.540
 lost 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.819
 I do not see this way 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.980
 I think I make people part of the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.790
 defeat of success until at the end 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.819
 the accounts we do not is not champion 11 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.640
 yes mean to pretend you did not in the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.159
 game but not understand us and I 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.370
 bands I've forgotten the most important is the 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.569
 movie very similar not what it is 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.280
 I think that is a sign that something 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.140
 executive Council 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.000
 this is important the analysis in a 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.939
 concessionaire and the willingness to 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.269
 climbing in the field and not the will is great 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.819
 it is that it is difficult for those who like 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.379
 for who never bought the athlete ever 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.480
 can go through an injury is always 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.359
 difficult when not only football 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.239
 sporting knows he can not do 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.819
 got faith is complicated then it 's 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.919
 Natural when you come back to Brazil, do you? 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.049
 I had notion of good childhood mass 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.530
 the research begins to decide in this 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:55.430
 first to 50 almost doubled clinicians and 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.530
 was exchanged with the goods in exchange with the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.049
 games is the best season the last game of the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.629
 bahia in the competition can not go 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.780
 training but feeling in Bahia has in 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.870
 mind the problem and try to play the maximum 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.940
 time to hide the action of the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 group in that turn play 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.769
 is you were throughout the state promises 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.170
 enough point you play next to you 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.580
 thiago snows and fred this players 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.740
 more experienced after the balance 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:28.110
 the extent to which it is important to 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.330
 back of the 3 comes back not only ours 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.400
 rate as soon as I said 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.680
 We've been playing the world back in the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.050
 Mexico is very little in Cuba 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.270
 So when do the players come back when 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.400
 are available more paper options is 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.100
 with vacancy now not returned is also 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.530
 hidden in an area with Anderson then 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.300
 I think that's for sure. 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.190
 if we have a cast of quality and 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.800
 they are all available which increases 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.750
 the quality of this year's 70's of the global era 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600
 try to show that the invoice in my new 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.520
 doll deco is with the other favor you are 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.820
 subject within the field can sing 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:08.310
 coming back but anyway and news 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:10.620
 do not look but I think it 's all in this 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.890
 career time work world 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.780
 stocks that have a greater interest in 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:21.540
 players for everything it represents 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.440
 but I see my door is waiting for you 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.600
 stayed out 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.430
 It's me for you to see something new in terms 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.220
 of Brazilian championship what you 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.600
 We think of the level of competition is who that 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.160
 will fight directly with the Fluminense 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.990
 is already well defined the opponent of the 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
 fluminense in the fight for the title 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.030
 You already have seen you fighting there. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.560
 underneath is thus directly against the 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.780
 relegation or a novelty in the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.490
 Some Chinese any club that you love 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.380
 until now but 20 and singing in the 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.040
 competition 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.610
 I do not think I have any news 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.810
 watching the athletic is a novelty until 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.400
 because there are great players 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.220
 today making it is playing has us 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.940
 player has fantastic young players 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.970
 and you can not fight for the title 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.300
 not a novelty by the man singing 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.980
 now maybe no news is a year 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.210
 difficult on the back of Corinthians and 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.940
 saints are not fighting for the title 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.470
 also due to the liberators but 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.690
 I do not think there's much secret in 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.430
 team is a team that has a great 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.470
 strong performance trainer as well. 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.910
 Proof is listening to nothing defined. 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.010
 not under 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.000
 down there is not is not complicated 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.160
 forgets 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.090
 I've never been such a situation . 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:40.090
 slap to fall but I imagine what it must 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.919
 be seen thus to those who are struggling with 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.500
 even more because of the palm trees time 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.169
 large ones that when passing of convenience 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.669
 and finances that the fight, right, I do not think 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.440
 which mathematically has no one 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.490
 demoted but has some clubs do not 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.490
 are more careful
