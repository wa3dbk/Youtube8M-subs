 gums as they do not melt away from the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:32.579
 refrigerator to start we will do 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 the form that will receive the gelatin and give 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 the format the earthworms for this you go 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.850
 need 50 strawberries a container 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 tall and thin if you have nothing 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 look like an American cup on tape 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.230
 adhesive first pulls the ends 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.780
 the straws so that they are of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.149
 investigated 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 then make a pile of straw 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.550
 leaving everyone with the fold part to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.550
 the same side 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.040
 with the help of adhesive tape attach the

 fit daughter on the bottom of the container 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.620
 leaving part of the works down 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.820
 it is worth remembering that the higher the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.010
 container that you use longer 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.900
 your little worms left another tip 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.970

 you find on the market 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.869
 if you use a strawberry shake 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.130
 for example it will get easier on the hour 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.170
 to unmount 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.920
 But before I talk about misinformation, I'll go 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.840

 green color that will give a more realistic color 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.680
 the earthworms 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.970
 bring to low heat for just one minute 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.970
 during this time it does not stop to move 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.040
 you will notice that the gelatin will 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.410

 remove the adhesive tapes and then

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.740
 of the pot you serve the worms 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.109
 now it was personal to remove the 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.180
 earthworms that remained inside the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.239

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.450

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.990
 while others were small 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.970
 and brittle 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.040
