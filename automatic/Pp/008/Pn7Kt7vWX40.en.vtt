ok<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.969> move<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.210> over<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> see

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
ok we move this over so you can see

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.219 
ok we move this over so you can see
there<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.430> then<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> double<00:02:00.990> back

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
there you go then you have a double back

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.190 
there you go then you have a double back
double<00:02:02.009> Bertha<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.149> quite<00:02:03.869> cool<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
double Bertha so that's quite cool you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.569 
double Bertha so that's quite cool you
don't<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.829> advice<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.369> decks

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
millions of stuff about this depth

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.190 
millions of stuff about this depth
there's<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.060> tons<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.690> stuff<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.050> guys

there's not tons of stuff that you guys

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.759 
there's not tons of stuff that you guys
really<00:03:05.040> need<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.310> know<00:03:05.489> because<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:06.030> not

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
really need to know because it's not

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.110 
really need to know because it's not
it's<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.860> really<00:03:08.100> nice<00:03:08.220> net<00:03:08.459> base<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.940> very

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
it's a really nice net base it's very

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.430 
it's a really nice net base it's very
simple<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.230> works<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.800> lot<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.730> magic

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
simple and it works a lot in the magic

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.770 
simple and it works a lot in the magic
decks<00:03:13.440> okay<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.850> let's<00:03:15.000> quickly<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:15.450> how<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
decks okay so let's quickly see how it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.569 
decks okay so let's quickly see how it
the<00:03:15.930> debt<00:03:16.140> canceled<00:03:16.650> handles<00:03:17.190> more<00:03:17.370> nicely

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
the debt canceled handles more nicely

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.280 
the debt canceled handles more nicely
handle<00:03:18.140> handles<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.670> found<00:03:21.290> amazingly

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
handle handles and so it found amazingly

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.880 
handle handles and so it found amazingly
and<00:03:23.269> let's<00:03:24.269> see<00:03:24.360> how<00:03:24.480> fans<00:03:25.110> if<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.680> show<00:03:25.829> you
