00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
artificial sweetener in it actually

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
artificial sweetener in it actually
increases<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:39.059> appetite<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.860> have

and literally thirty minutes later I was
craving<00:00:54.360> sugar<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
craving sugar and it's because that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.619

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
artificial sweetener tricks your body

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
artificial sweetener tricks your body
into<00:00:57.809> believing<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:59.100> sugar<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
into believing it's sugar and then you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.220 
into believing it's sugar and then you
want<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.600> yeah<00:01:00.780> exactly

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
want more of it yeah exactly

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.439 
want more of it yeah exactly
so<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.340> very<00:01:02.910> bad<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
so it's actually very very bad for you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
so it's actually very very bad for you
and<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> been<00:01:04.830> some<00:01:05.100> studies

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and also there have been some studies

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
and also there have been some studies
that<00:01:05.489> indicate<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> aspartame<00:01:06.930> causes

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that indicate that aspartame causes

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.700 
that indicate that aspartame causes
cancer<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:09.330> those<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.750> brain<00:01:09.990> yes

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
cancer so those are brain yes

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
cancer so those are brain yes
so<00:01:10.860> obviously<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.880> research<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so obviously do your research on that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.810 
so obviously do your research on that
prior<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.960> drinking<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.369> large

prior to drinking you know large

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539 
prior to drinking you know large
quantities<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> aspartame<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> feel

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
quantities of aspartame but just I feel

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.830 
quantities of aspartame but just I feel
like<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> best<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.750> your

weight so that's a big myth the sake of

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.620 
weight so that's a big myth the sake of
the<00:02:11.550> fourth<00:02:11.790> myth<00:02:12.060> we're<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.330> cover

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the fourth myth we're gonna cover

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.740 
the fourth myth we're gonna cover
is<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.320> sugar<00:02:13.560> causes<00:02:13.980> diabetes<00:02:14.700> which<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
is that sugar causes diabetes which I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.120 
is that sugar causes diabetes which I
have<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.990> admit<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.410> had<00:02:16.560> previously<00:02:17.040> thought

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
have to admit I had previously thought

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
have to admit I had previously thought
was<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.090> case<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.480> didn't<00:02:18.900> think<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> was

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
was the case I didn't think it was

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.900 
was the case I didn't think it was
necessarily<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.680> one-to-one<00:02:20.100> sort<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.670> thing

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
necessarily a one-to-one sort of thing

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.950 
necessarily a one-to-one sort of thing
but<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> thought<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> was<00:02:21.870> definitely

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
but I thought that it was definitely

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
but I thought that it was definitely
involved<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> reason<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
involved in it and the reason is that we

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.220 
involved in it and the reason is that we
understand<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
understand that one of the one of the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.500 
understand that one of the one of the
symptoms<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.860> diabetes<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.880> high<00:02:27.000> blood<00:02:27.180> sugar

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
symptoms of diabetes is high blood sugar

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.180 
symptoms of diabetes is high blood sugar
but<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.260> caused<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.070> not<00:02:29.130> like

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
but if that caused my like it's not like

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
but if that caused my like it's not like
you're<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.520> packing<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.270> body<00:02:30.480> full<00:02:30.720> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you're just packing your body full of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.530 
you're just packing your body full of
sugar<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.430> overeating<00:02:33.420> in

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
sugar it's that like with overeating in

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.480 
sugar it's that like with overeating in
