through<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.480> learning<00:04:00.840> what<00:04:01.440> each<00:04:01.620> card

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
through and learning what each card

could<00:04:10.740> mean<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.880> what<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.330> sense<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.750> I

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
could mean and and what the sense that I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.340

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
turn around what I've learned so far has

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.190 
turn around what I've learned so far has
been<00:04:52.560> absolutely<00:04:53.360> fascinating<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.570> I'm

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
been absolutely fascinating and I'm

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.760 
been absolutely fascinating and I'm
really<00:04:56.130> thoroughly<00:04:56.490> enjoying<00:04:57.120> learning<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.960> I

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
really thoroughly enjoying learning it I

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.310 
really thoroughly enjoying learning it I
put<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.310> down<00:04:59.490> ever<00:04:59.790> so<00:05:00.030> often<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:01.050> take<00:05:01.290> a

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
put it down ever so often and I take a

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.000 
put it down ever so often and I take a
break<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.610> let<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:02.970> absorb<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.750> i<00:05:04.650> found

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
break and I let it absorb and i found

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.320 
break and I let it absorb and i found
that<00:05:05.100> that's<00:05:05.340> working<00:05:05.760> for<00:05:05.970> me<00:05:06.090> so<00:05:06.300> far

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
that that's working for me so far

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.380 
that that's working for me so far
because<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:08.160> not<00:05:08.400> something<00:05:08.910> like<00:05:09.240> my

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
because it's not something like my

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.380 
because it's not something like my
father<00:05:09.630> was<00:05:09.960> really<00:05:10.410> into<00:05:13.820> celestial<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.360> uh

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
father was really into celestial and uh

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.270 
father was really into celestial and uh
i<00:05:17.330> don't<00:05:18.330> know<00:05:18.540> how<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.080> explain<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.530> he<00:05:20.130> was

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280
