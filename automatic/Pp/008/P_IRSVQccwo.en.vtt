bit and almost as if everything with a
slow<00:01:37.250> motion<00:01:37.640> at<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.759> point<00:01:38.149> you've<00:01:38.929> never

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
slow motion at that point you've never

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.620 
slow motion at that point you've never
been<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:39.679> a<00:01:39.739> failed<00:01:39.979> white<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:41.270> wide

especially paddling in on a nine eight

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.510 
especially paddling in on a nine eight
it's<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.209> real<00:01:44.739> different<00:01:45.739> feeling<00:01:46.099> feeling

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it's a real different feeling feeling

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.010

inside of the barrel and trying to
control<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.470> board<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:50.660> had<00:01:50.810> two

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
control the board and it had two

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.719 
control the board and it had two
sections<00:01:51.470> throw<00:01:51.709> over<00:01:51.860> me<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.099> one<00:01:52.280> point<00:01:52.489> you

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
sections throw over me at one point you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.520 
sections throw over me at one point you
know<00:01:52.789> I<00:01:52.849> didn't<00:01:53.690> think<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:53.959> was<00:01:54.050> gonna<00:01:54.229> make<00:01:54.500> it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
know I didn't think I was gonna make it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.809 
know I didn't think I was gonna make it
but<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.890> foam<00:01:55.099> ball<00:01:55.280> came<00:01:55.489> up<00:01:55.610> underneath

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
but the foam ball came up underneath
