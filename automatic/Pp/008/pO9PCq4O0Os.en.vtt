00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
to now of course the macbook air you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.339 
to now of course the macbook air you
know<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.620> would<00:02:39.830> be<00:02:39.860> probably<00:02:40.370> around<00:02:40.550> 3,000

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349

around three thousand seven dollars and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.270 
around three thousand seven dollars and
I<00:02:45.540> believe<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> around<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> macbook<00:02:47.099> was

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I believe that around the macbook was

I believe that around the macbook was
the<00:02:47.700> macbook<00:02:48.000> air<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.360> about<00:02:48.540> 3,000<00:02:49.140> something

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the macbook air be about 3,000 something

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.010 
the macbook air be about 3,000 something
dollars<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.819> macbook<00:02:51.360> for<00:02:51.569> all<00:02:51.870> the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
dollars and the macbook for all the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.420 
dollars and the macbook for all the
specs<00:02:52.319> would<00:02:52.470> only<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.739> two<00:02:52.950> thousand<00:02:53.340> seven

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
specs would only be two thousand seven

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.670 
specs would only be two thousand seven
hundred<00:02:53.550> designed<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.239> something<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.569> that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
hundred designed or something like that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.460 
hundred designed or something like that
now<00:02:55.680> uh<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.599> is<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.870> hypothetically

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
now uh you this is just hypothetically

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
now uh you this is just hypothetically
let's<00:02:58.590> say<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.860> getting<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.280> free<00:02:59.310> what
