00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.920
 new video I am the dawn bayo and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 today we are going to talk about the prices that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.090
 announced bq for its three new 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.090
 models the aquarium bq m 5 m 45 ym 5.5 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.970
 of the world 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.000
 for those who do not know it, bq is a 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.039
 Spanish brand that manufactures mobiles 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.570
 obviously these mobile phones are 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 they make in china but that's as much as 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.509
 say that samsung is a brand that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.460
 manufactures in china or that apple is a 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.030
 brand that manufactures in China almost obvious 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.949
 However , in Spain and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 expanding also in some countries 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.940
 bq have relevance is quite 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.100
 important because it 's offering 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 free terminals at an economical price 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 especially at a time when others 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.699
 competitors have gone a little bit 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.620
 the clouds has now presented three 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.019
 new models and I want to talk about 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.530
 because he has presented many 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.960
 variants the first is the current bq and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 m-45 a mobile with one gigas of memory 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
 ram mediatek core media processor 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 four cores a quad core and one 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.460
 4.5 inch screen one resolution 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.119
 qhd but with a lowercase that is 960 x 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.340
 540 pixels price 169 with 90 euros and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.649
 you will say and that it has novelty then that 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.390
 we can choose that instead of the 8 gigas 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.820
 of storage that has base 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 choose you have 16 and buy a model 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 for 10 euros more with 16 great 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 makes me against launching the bums 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.549
 No, I do not pay, but also because 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.979
 20 euros more for 199 euros we have the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.960
 mode with 2 gb of ram memory is 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.409
 say that in a same model of 4.5 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.810
 inches 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 we can choose 8 or 16 gb dinner 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.820
 internal or 1 or 2 gigs of ram memory 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 but the thing does not end here besides the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.430
 5-inch model the 5 m aquarium that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.470
 has a full hd screen in this case 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 since it is going to a decent resolution 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.149
 it also comes out from the 16 gigas of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.289
 internal storage and 2 gigs of ram 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.920
 that is the basic 259 euros that passes then 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:09.179
 we can not go to 279 if we want 16 and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 32 gb and 2 gigabytes RAM but if 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.390
 both of us and it does not seem a bit like 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 we want specific because we are going to play 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.230
 and they want a super fluid multitasking 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.629
 299 euros and we planted in the 32 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.690
 gigabytes of internal storage and in addition 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.750
 in the 3 gigas of ram memory something 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.450
 similar we have it in the aquarium 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.459
 55 the m 55 that has full hd panel but 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.340
 say it like 5 inches and prices 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.349
 they reach up to 339 euros but 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 again we talk about the top end of a 32 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.920
 gb internal lie with a RAM memory 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.569
 3 gigas of memory as we say what happens 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.510
 that all these mobile phones have for 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.940
 Of course lte wifi bluetooth gps and others 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.269
 dual sim something important and they all come 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.489
 with android 5.0 lollipop and we hope that 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.109
 updatable to android m we do not know 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.700
 still but good considering 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.859
 that have still literally put us 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.440
 for sale would be a pretty rare thing 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.860
 that will not be updated 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.490
 comment own opinion of mine seems to me 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.680
 great that quebec in its range to quad 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.140
 have decided to launch such amount of 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.610
 models so we can choose is to say 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.870
 that I want small screen mobile 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.220
 4.5 great but I need a lot 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.640
 internal memory because I'm going for 16 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.350
 gigas 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.670
 no no I want the screen more 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.770
 great but I do not have to have 3 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.200
 gigas of ram then you take the two or 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.200
 say no to me something in between 5 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.450
 but hey with power with 3 gigas of ram 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.640
 not said the model 5 and 5.5 has the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.010
 snapdragon 615 something that you also have to 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.120
 will consider no more have to 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.370
 analyze it we have already put in 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.500
 contact with bq to be transferred to us 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.070
 I'm afraid it's going to take a while 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.780
 the thing you can not do more 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.790
 We will give our opinion on these 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.250
 terminals and we want you to give us the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.100
 your about this throwing several 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.710
 models that vary in ram and in memory 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.630
 internal to see if the fact that 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.030
 have different prices then hey 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.660
 adapt better or worse to the pockets of 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.060
