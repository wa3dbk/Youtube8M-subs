00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.960 
later on about a 529 plan it's a great
way<00:04:37.840> for<00:04:37.900> her<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.140> put<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.500> in<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.740> fun<00:04:39.070> from<00:04:39.850> her

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
way for her to put it in a fun from her

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.630 
way for her to put it in a fun from her
employer<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:40.780> tax-free<00:04:41.770> going<00:04:42.460> into

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
employer that is tax-free going into

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.300 
employer that is tax-free going into
that<00:04:42.760> account<00:04:43.090> kind<00:04:43.780> of<00:04:43.840> like<00:04:44.020> you're<00:04:44.280> like<00:04:45.280> a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
that account kind of like you're like a

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.000 
that account kind of like you're like a
traditional<00:04:45.850> IRA<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.440> long<00:04:47.590> as<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.770> comes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
traditional IRA and so long as it comes

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.400 
traditional IRA and so long as it comes
out<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.280> pay<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:48.580> kids<00:04:48.880> education<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.780> never

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
out to pay for kids education it never

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.380 
out to pay for kids education it never
gets<00:04:50.620> taxed<00:04:51.010> so<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.370> basically<00:04:51.460> grows<00:04:52.090> as

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
gets taxed so it basically grows as

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.320 
gets taxed so it basically grows as
gross<00:04:52.930> income<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:54.100> comes<00:04:54.370> out<00:04:54.610> tax<00:04:54.970> free

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
gross income and it comes out tax free

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.700 
gross income and it comes out tax free
so<00:04:55.870> hopefully<00:04:56.050> those<00:04:56.260> are<00:04:56.410> some<00:04:56.560> great

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
so hopefully those are some great

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.990
