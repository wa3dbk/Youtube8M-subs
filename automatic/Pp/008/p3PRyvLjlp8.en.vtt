00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.340
 be fine then today I will you 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.090
 find for my third makeup 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.180
 festive 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.270
 so there for once I really played 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.560
 the party makeup card at background to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.300
 share at the color level I am 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.699
 remained fairly classic this is a 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:29.779
 silver and black makeup 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:33.530
 no very glittery makeup and some 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:37.340
 colorful lips this makeup you are 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.170
 not at all obliged to do everything at the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.059
 letter close ie at the level 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.680
 glitter it's up to you to dose 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.539
 next if you want a makeup 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.730
 very glittery or just with a few 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.500
 glitter and also at the level of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.670
 lipstick from the gloss you are not 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.280
 obliged to wear a little color 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 raspberry red like I did there so 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.559
 you prefer to put something 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.120
 more neutral 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.739
 there is no problem it is up to you to 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 see what so in any case I hope that 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.190
 these make-ups will please you and I will 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.109
 leave everything with explanations 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.820
 so for starters I have already come 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.860
 apply my eyelid base so there 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.500
 I used the purchase of insurance from 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 any faith I apply then a pigment 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.560
 bp from home so it's a cosmetic 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 pigment that is silver gray that has a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.240
 mechanical effect 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.280
 so I'll put you the reference in 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.299
 info bar because there is not 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.540
 everything written behind the label and I 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.310
 applied on the entire eyelid 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 mobile with a flat brush 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.190
 very slightly flute and the edges 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.760
 then I come applied to a blush to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.470
 black eyelids so you take 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.869
 any eyeshadow me I 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.600
 am going to use the black out of home 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:15.140
 claimed red to apply it in 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.380
 my outer corner and at the beginning of the hollow in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.380
 made 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.200
 and then I come dimmed 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.280
 you see when we mix black and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.680
 the silvery pigment makes a pretty 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.810
 color it's a black but that's not 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.220
 too intense but intense enough to 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.640
 to define a little bit more the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.940
 makeup so the goes back to the level of 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.940
 hollow 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.870
 so I do not hesitate to wipe my 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:21.050
 brush is not in the meantime for 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.050
 blur without doing two tasks 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.990
 keep reapplying but payet so for that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.590
 I take silver glitter as 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.569
 this is the glitter that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.970
 I had bought at least three 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.130
 years old I had found another glitter 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.770
 at gifi already take a flat brush 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.880
 and I'm going to come moisten it with a 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:55.260
 makeup fixer I come very 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.870
 high but payet so I tap well 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.209
 to avoid the maximum of fall 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.650
 good anyway with glitter 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.840
 will always come some of which so 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:12.310
 once I took out but payet I 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:15.450
 will come and squeeze them like these on 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.450
 the silver pigment 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.730
 and then had a tap 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.590
 therefore increased in terms of quantity of 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.150
 glitter it's up to you to see if you 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.410
 want something very not been or 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:42.230
 if you want something a little 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:44.390
 more discreet then I read apply my 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.190
 light touch so me since 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.700
 it's a pretty glittery makeup with 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.590
 of black 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.280
 I told myself at the touch 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.680
 light we will stay pretty neutral me 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.880
 I have to take a lighthouse matt of color 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.880
 flesh so it's the king who 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.959
 so he can barely see himself but 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:12.919
 but it's really about unifying the 

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:15.439
 below the arcade and blur a 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.719
 little bit the edges of having some 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:22.789
 thing melted well Thursday reapply 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:25.429
 a little bit of the blackout lighthouse for 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:31.969
 step up a little bit more the corner 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:33.259
 external from one report to the other look at 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.799
 level of the key light corner 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.689
 internal 

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:37.689
 I will apply the lighthouse to Jean 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:53.489
 this last axis he so I resume the 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.489
 lighthouse black out 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:10.010
 he 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:11.750
 I come the blur theo must come 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:17.000
 apply a little glitter 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:25.580
 so I take back my flat brush that I 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.560
 come back modified I take a tiny 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:37.360
 little glitter on the edge of the 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:37.360
 brush and I just tap 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.340
 applied my black pencil in hollow and 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.350
 I then apply my flat mascara 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.190
 will use the fast and perfect volume 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:57.080
 from bourjois for the bluff 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.840
 I apply a blush of chirvan dickey 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.790
 so it's a cream blush in shades a 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.470
 destiny so it's a little color 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:10.790
 peach like that which is slightly satin 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:14.300
 so I'm going to apply with a brush 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.300
 duo fiber 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.300
 payet he can barely see but he gives 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.990
 a little glowy side and then at the level 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.500
 lips 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.230
 I wanted to play the holidays thoroughly so 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.620
 I applied a gloss from sephora 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.670
 which is red raspberry at the level of the 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.950
 reference is the number then we see 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:45.320
 not very good I stayed 58 or 59 it's 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.320
 the latin china rice 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.030
 here are the girls this party makeup 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.250
