if they're going to utilize for their

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:33.010 
if they're going to utilize for their
home<00:01:21.950> program<00:01:22.950> after<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.729> clinic

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.070 

I<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> fact<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.880> used<00:01:36.780> as

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
I like the fact that it can be used as

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.140 
I like the fact that it can be used as
cardiovascular<00:01:37.830> exercise<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:38.820> also

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
cardiovascular exercise and also

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
cardiovascular exercise and also
incorporate<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> resistive<00:01:40.560> exercise

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
incorporate the resistive exercise

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
incorporate the resistive exercise
because<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.090> weighted<00:01:42.890> each<00:01:44.960> piece<00:01:45.960> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
because they are weighted each piece of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
because they are weighted each piece of
equipment<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:47.940> three<00:01:48.180> different

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
equipment is there's three different

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
equipment is there's three different
weights<00:01:48.900> and<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:50.640> being<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.620> can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
weights and it's being so you can

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.110 
weights and it's being so you can
incrementally<00:01:53.390> increase<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:55.080> resistive

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
incrementally increase the resistive

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.270 
incrementally increase the resistive
component<00:01:57.120> of<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.230> comes<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.830> very

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
component of it it comes with a very

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.990 
component of it it comes with a very
good<00:01:59.520> CD<00:02:01.040> showing<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.190> versatility<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:02.880> can

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
good CD showing the versatility you can

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.390 
good CD showing the versatility you can
use<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:04.050> resistive<00:02:04.530> exercises<00:02:05.010> but<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
use it for resistive exercises but I

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.770 
use it for resistive exercises but I
first<00:02:05.610> show<00:02:05.880> many<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.240> well<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.570> lower

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
first show many as well as lower

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.609 
first show many as well as lower
extremity<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.920> problem<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.320> CD<00:02:10.320> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
extremity the problem with the CD is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.130 
extremity the problem with the CD is
that<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.330> demonstrates<00:02:12.570> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that it is it just demonstrates that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.199 
that it is it just demonstrates that
each<00:02:13.320> exercise<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.150> be

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
each exercise and I think there would be

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.800 
each exercise and I think there would be
value<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> whole<00:02:16.200> exercise<00:02:17.240> regime<00:02:18.240> as<00:02:18.510> far

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
value to a whole exercise regime as far

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.190 
value to a whole exercise regime as far
as<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.370> exercise<00:02:20.820> for<00:02:21.360> 30<00:02:21.600> seconds

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
as you do one exercise for 30 seconds

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
as you do one exercise for 30 seconds
the<00:02:22.350> next<00:02:22.500> exercise<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.340> 30<00:02:23.490> seconds<00:02:24.060> they

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
the next exercise for 30 seconds they

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
is a good thing they I love the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.009 
is a good thing they I love the
ergonomic<00:02:56.430> design<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:57.540> takes<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.840> lot<00:02:57.989> of

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
ergonomic design it takes a lot of

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.400 
ergonomic design it takes a lot of
pressure<00:02:58.320> if<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.070> use<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.690> triceps

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
pressure if you use it for triceps

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.479 
pressure if you use it for triceps
presses<00:03:01.860> for<00:03:02.100> example<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:04.280> keep<00:03:05.280> your

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
presses for example you can keep your

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.310 
presses for example you can keep your
wrist<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.030> nice<00:03:06.209> natural<00:03:06.510> functional

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
wrist in a nice natural functional

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.229 
wrist in a nice natural functional
position<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.250> reduces<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.850> lot<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
position so it reduces a lot of the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.990 
position so it reduces a lot of the
stress<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.750> would<00:03:09.870> put<00:03:10.050> on<00:03:10.080> your<00:03:10.260> body

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
stress you would put on your body

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.080 
stress you would put on your body
because<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:13.040> moves<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.550> really<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
because it moves so I really like the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.240 
because it moves so I really like the
design<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> versatility<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.709> like

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
design I like the versatility I like

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
the three positions to the right to the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.370 
the three positions to the right to the
left<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.970> then<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.389> midline<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.260> it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
left and then in the midline so it

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.590 
left and then in the midline so it
really<00:04:37.650> forces<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.490> align<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.330> find

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
really forces you to align and find

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600 
really forces you to align and find
symmetry<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.820> also<00:04:42.389> is<00:04:42.720> very<00:04:42.990> easy<00:04:43.289> to<00:04:43.590> hold<00:04:43.770> so

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
symmetry it also is very easy to hold so

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.850 
symmetry it also is very easy to hold so
often<00:04:45.090> times<00:04:45.570> with<00:04:45.900> free<00:04:46.229> weights<00:04:46.500> or

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
often times with free weights or

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.250 
often times with free weights or
dumbbells<00:04:47.700> hype<00:04:48.479> situations<00:04:49.350> or<00:04:51.229> here<00:04:52.229> a

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
dumbbells hype situations or here a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.870 
dumbbells hype situations or here a
wrist<00:04:52.590> position<00:04:52.770> is<00:04:53.160> limited<00:04:53.520> by<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
wrist position is limited by the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.300 
wrist position is limited by the
position<00:04:54.450> of<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.780> dumbbells<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:56.039> fact

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
position of the dumbbells so the fact

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.090 
position of the dumbbells so the fact
that<00:04:56.430> these<00:04:56.729> are<00:04:57.240> free<00:04:58.020> moving<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.680> really

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
that these are free moving it really

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.490 
that these are free moving it really
reduces<00:04:59.669> the<00:05:00.120> stress<00:05:00.690> that<00:05:00.720> you<00:05:01.050> may<00:05:01.229> put<00:05:01.470> on

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
reduces the stress that you may put on

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.700 
reduces the stress that you may put on
your<00:05:01.890> hands<00:05:02.820> wrists<00:05:03.450> and<00:05:04.340> forearm<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.580> elbow

what<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.979> lent<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:10.010> avid<00:05:11.010> weightlifter

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
what I lent it to a avid weightlifter

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.510 
what I lent it to a avid weightlifter
and<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:12.000> problem<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.510> we<00:05:12.600> found<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.320> that

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
and the problem that we found is that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.460 
and the problem that we found is that
he's<00:05:14.520> lip<00:05:14.760> was<00:05:15.240> limited<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.930> using<00:05:16.169> this

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.990 
weight his weights on his normal weight
lifting<00:05:19.320> system<00:05:19.530> did<00:05:20.250> not<00:05:20.460> stay<00:05:20.880> on<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.930> sides

limits its versatility for avid weight

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.150 
limits its versatility for avid weight
lifters<00:05:42.360> but<00:05:42.840> it's<00:05:43.020> plenty<00:05:43.410> heavy<00:05:43.650> for<00:05:44.010> those

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
of us that are just exercising at home

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.430 
of us that are just exercising at home
and<00:05:46.950> trying<00:05:47.159> to<00:05:47.340> stay<00:05:47.580> healthy<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.630> fit

and trying to stay healthy and fit
what<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:50.039> like<00:05:50.250> about<00:05:50.400> both<00:05:50.700> of<00:05:50.729> these<00:05:51.060> in

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
what I like about both of these in

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.750 
what I like about both of these in
one<00:05:52.140> growing<00:05:53.140> problem<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.220> we<00:05:54.340> see<00:05:54.580> in<00:05:54.640> the

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
one growing problem that we see in the

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.420 
one growing problem that we see in the
clinic<00:05:55.090> is<00:05:55.270> osteoporosis<00:05:55.750> for<00:05:56.710> men<00:05:56.890> and<00:05:57.190> for

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
clinic is osteoporosis for men and for

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.740 
clinic is osteoporosis for men and for
women<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.060> lot<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.330> times<00:05:58.540> we're

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
women and a lot of times we're

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.230 
women and a lot of times we're
addressing<00:05:59.230> just<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.590> cardio<00:05:59.950> factor<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:01.000> we

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
addressing just the cardio factor and we

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.440 
addressing just the cardio factor and we
were<00:06:01.710> limited<00:06:02.710> as<00:06:03.040> far<00:06:03.640> as<00:06:03.850> resistive

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
were limited as far as resistive

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.840 
were limited as far as resistive
exercises<00:06:05.020> go<00:06:05.380> so<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:05.770> think<00:06:05.890> there's<00:06:06.730> a

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
exercises go so I think there's a

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.930 
exercises go so I think there's a
clinician<00:06:07.450> I<00:06:07.810> think<00:06:08.050> it's<00:06:08.200> very<00:06:08.410> important<00:06:09.040> to

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
clinician I think it's very important to

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.440 
clinician I think it's very important to
find<00:06:11.220> exercise<00:06:12.220> equipment<00:06:12.490> such<00:06:13.000> as<00:06:13.180> this

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
find exercise equipment such as this

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.560 
find exercise equipment such as this
that<00:06:13.870> can<00:06:14.740> both<00:06:15.070> address<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.670> cardiovascular

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
that can both address the cardiovascular

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.500 
that can both address the cardiovascular
needs<00:06:16.780> as<00:06:17.020> well<00:06:17.350> as<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.430> resistive<00:06:18.910> exercises

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
needs as well as the resistive exercises

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.040 
needs as well as the resistive exercises
and<00:06:19.990> I<00:06:20.920> think<00:06:21.340> by<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.060> being<00:06:22.390> one<00:06:22.600> piece<00:06:22.840> of

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
and I think by it being one piece of

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.490 
and I think by it being one piece of
equipment<00:06:23.320> that's<00:06:23.890> cost<00:06:24.220> effective<00:06:24.430> I

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
equipment that's cost effective I

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.980 
equipment that's cost effective I
believe<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.860> will<00:06:27.210> accomplish<00:06:28.210> both<00:06:28.690> which

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
believe it will accomplish both which

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.370 
believe it will accomplish both which
will<00:06:29.230> ultimately<00:06:29.680> improve<00:06:30.100> compliance<00:06:31.380> and

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
will ultimately improve compliance and

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.900 
will ultimately improve compliance and
when<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:32.560> make<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:32.920> recommendation<00:06:33.580> on<00:06:33.700> any

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
when I make the recommendation on any

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.300 
when I make the recommendation on any
equipment<00:06:34.270> I<00:06:34.540> always<00:06:34.960> focus<00:06:35.680> on<00:06:35.890> the

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
equipment I always focus on the

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.920 
equipment I always focus on the
compliance<00:06:36.880> factor<00:06:37.300> because<00:06:37.510> we<00:06:37.630> can<00:06:37.780> have

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
compliance factor because we can have

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.660 
compliance factor because we can have
the<00:06:38.140> best<00:06:38.260> exercise<00:06:38.830> equipment<00:06:39.310> in<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.460> world

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
the best exercise equipment in the world

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.340 
the best exercise equipment in the world
but<00:06:39.910> it<00:06:40.060> won't<00:06:40.210> help<00:06:40.480> us<00:06:40.660> unless<00:06:41.050> we<00:06:41.260> use<00:06:41.290> it<00:06:41.850> so

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
but it won't help us unless we use it so

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.810 
but it won't help us unless we use it so
I'm<00:06:44.350> happy<00:06:44.620> to<00:06:44.860> address<00:06:45.460> any<00:06:45.790> specific

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
I'm happy to address any specific
