 dedicated to asus tf300 tablet 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.590
 namely calibration and touch glass 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 a case when you got this into your hands 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.050
 tablet with broken glass you bought 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.380
 new same glass she put not 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 it works it works on one such 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:41.879
 the reason is that it exists 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:46.530
 several revisions of the touch glass and in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 depending on these revisions that is 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.969
 touch glass does not want to work with 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.969
 your tablet 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.740
 in and bring factory touch glass 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:15.840
 our tablet is different from you 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:19.509
 the fact that I bought put it here 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.289
 i will tell you so in this case you can 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.229
 buy touch glass from any revision 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:30.850
 no difference because well, rarely 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.740
 comes across so you could find so on 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.830
 glass is such a revise which is necessary 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.979
 and in this case you need to flash one 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.979
 file and for this we need 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 usually wireless mouse wired 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.509
 no difference here then cable if you 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 you can get one for this model 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.450
 or dock station if you have one and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.759
 of course micro usb memory card 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.119
 I am now explaining to you the easiest 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.519
 way to calibrate the touchscreen as their 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.570
 there are many well, at least 5 of them 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.470
 I explain to you the easiest flash drive mouse 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.170
 Here is such a docking station file 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.079
 which you feeling skin throw off in 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 memory card root 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:33.840
 it is about and porridge as usual applications for 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.840
 android insert flash drive 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.370
 connect like that for a mouse 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.280
 then go to file manager explorer 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:25.340
 find our file on a flash drive here it is 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:30.320
 called so here 2 don't need that side 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.320
 tf300t . 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:50.109
 stop it so application 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:53.500
 set open wait until 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:04:00.099
 here this process will end off 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:02.049
 sure that's such and only then 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.859
 when you got this on the screen 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.010
 here is the information you need to reload 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.010
 the tablet 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:22.259
 I do it so we pull out the battery 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:29.070
 we put our battery back 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:29.070
 palm flat on the touch glass and 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:43.470
 turn on and here in this process 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.470
 hand can not be torn off 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.190
 need to keep the attack to the end otherwise 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.190
 calibration will not work 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:21.110
 patiently wait for the end of the process and 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.110
 get in their reward 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:44.819
 so turned on we remove the hand check 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.819
 Valya everything works this way it should work 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:05.920
 but if it suddenly happens that you don't 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:11.510
 You will find this or you will not have 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:16.490
 docking stations on the internet have instructions 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:20.870
 how to collect from improvised means 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.880
