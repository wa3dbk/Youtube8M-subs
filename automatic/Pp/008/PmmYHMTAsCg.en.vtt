concerned when they only had two options
because<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:10.729> all<00:02:10.880> think<00:02:11.120> with<00:02:11.210> BB<00:02:11.450> creams<00:02:11.720> that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900

this however only comes in the medium to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.850 
this however only comes in the medium to
deep<00:02:18.690> skin<00:02:18.960> tone<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.500> was<00:02:19.650> fine

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
deep skin tone and that was fine

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.040 
deep skin tone and that was fine
actually<00:02:20.280> after<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.640> got<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.120> when<00:02:21.930> you

actually after I got it because when you
get<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.410> you'll<00:02:22.740> notice<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.880> lotion<00:02:24.810> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
get it you'll notice that the lotion is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.340 
get it you'll notice that the lotion is
our<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.710> cream<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.250> actually<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.940> its<00:02:27.360> usual

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.560 

it's<00:02:31.350> not<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.830> normal<00:02:32.100> BB<00:02:32.640> cream<00:02:32.940> tint<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.510> to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
it's not a normal BB cream tint so to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's not a normal BB cream tint so to
say<00:02:33.810> our<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> BB<00:02:34.530> cream<00:02:34.560> tint<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.430> I

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
say our it is a BB cream tint but I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.520 
say our it is a BB cream tint but I
guess<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> more<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.510> universal<00:02:37.290> BB

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
guess this is a more of a universal BB

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.100 
guess this is a more of a universal BB
cream<00:02:37.740> tense<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.450> when<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> take<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> look<00:02:39.930> at

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
cream tense so when you take a look at

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.570 
cream tense so when you take a look at
it<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.470> don't<00:02:40.800> know<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.010> guys<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.490> it

middle<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.350> day<00:03:22.560> like<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.310> my<00:03:23.430> clothes<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
middle of the day like for my clothes I

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.949 
middle of the day like for my clothes I
guess<00:03:23.880> rubbing<00:03:24.299> off<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.570> butter<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
guess rubbing off the butter or the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.350 
guess rubbing off the butter or the
lotion<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:26.730> has<00:03:26.880> staying<00:03:27.239> power

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
demarcation where my skin my skin is a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.550 
demarcation where my skin my skin is a
little<00:04:11.820> bit<00:04:11.910> darker<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:13.019> what<00:04:13.290> I'm<00:04:13.380> really

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
little bit darker and so what I'm really

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.259 
little bit darker and so what I'm really
hoping<00:04:13.799> is<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.100> as<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.519> continue<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:15.000> use<00:04:15.150> the

product it'll start to even out the skin
tone<00:04:17.519> or<00:04:18.060> even<00:04:18.359> out<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.660> line<00:04:18.870> of

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
tone or even out that line of

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.440 
tone or even out that line of
demarcation<00:04:19.229> in<00:04:19.769> there<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.609> my<00:04:20.790> skin<00:04:21.269> will

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
demarcation in there and so my skin will

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.790 
demarcation in there and so my skin will
be<00:04:21.540> just<00:04:21.780> one<00:04:22.019> even<00:04:22.470> tone<00:04:23.750> as<00:04:24.750> far<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.440> firming

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
be just one even tone as far as firming

be just one even tone as far as firming
my<00:04:25.919> skin<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.520> think<00:04:26.910> that's<00:04:27.360> something<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.750> would

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
my skin I think that's something I would

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.600 
my skin I think that's something I would
have<00:04:27.930> to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
have to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.610 
have to
to<00:04:29.379> see<00:04:30.379> over<00:04:30.800> time<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.689> have<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.199> lot<00:04:33.590> of

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
to see over time I do have a lot of

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.469 
to see over time I do have a lot of
little<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.159> know<00:04:34.310> there<00:04:34.819> pools<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.419> stuff

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
little you know there pools and stuff

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.760 
little you know there pools and stuff
like<00:04:35.719> that<00:04:35.870> because<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.259> haven't<00:04:36.469> been<00:04:36.740> a

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
like that because I haven't been a

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.369 
like that because I haven't been a
solution<00:04:37.039> isn't<00:04:37.490> working<00:04:37.969> out<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.840> I<00:04:39.050> should

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:39.379 
solution isn't working out like I should

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.230 
solution isn't working out like I should
so<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.919> am<00:04:40.219> gonna<00:04:40.400> continue<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.819> use<00:04:40.969> it

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
so I am gonna continue to use it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.300 
so I am gonna continue to use it
especially<00:04:41.659> on<00:04:42.139> my<00:04:42.289> arms<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.770> definitely<00:04:43.219> on

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
my legs to see if it'll even firm out

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.839 
my legs to see if it'll even firm out
some<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.650> my<00:04:45.680> skin<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:46.189> just<00:04:46.370> make<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.639> look<00:04:46.729> a

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
some of my skin and just make it look a

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.580 
some of my skin and just make it look a
little<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.330> little<00:04:47.539> bit<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:47.960> smoother<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:50.590> as

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
little a little bit more smoother and as

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.659 
little a little bit more smoother and as
far<00:04:51.770> as<00:04:51.830> minimizing<00:04:52.310> imperfections<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:54.669> guess

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
far as minimizing imperfections I guess

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.499 
far as minimizing imperfections I guess
for<00:04:56.120> me<00:04:57.490> imperfection<00:04:58.490> it's<00:04:58.849> really<00:04:59.150> hard<00:04:59.360> to

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
for me imperfection it's really hard to

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.820 
for me imperfection it's really hard to
describe<00:04:59.689> an<00:04:59.930> imperfection<00:05:00.319> like<00:05:00.650> an

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
describe an imperfection like an

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.040 
describe an imperfection like an
imperfection<00:05:01.370> for<00:05:01.699> me<00:05:01.789> can<00:05:01.939> be<00:05:01.969> like<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.449> scab

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
imperfection for me can be like a scab

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.209 
imperfection for me can be like a scab
or<00:05:03.409> a<00:05:03.439> bump<00:05:03.770> or<00:05:04.009> it<00:05:04.969> could<00:05:05.180> be<00:05:05.300> like<00:05:05.539> a<00:05:06.219> area

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
or a bump or it could be like a area

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.580 
or a bump or it could be like a area
where<00:05:07.430> I've<00:05:07.610> had<00:05:08.000> ace<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.900> could<00:05:09.050> be<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.169> scar

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
where I've had ace it could be a scar

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.129 
where I've had ace it could be a scar
and<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.639> in<00:05:10.849> five<00:05:11.060> days<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.599> kind<00:05:11.719> of<00:05:11.840> hard<00:05:12.080> to

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
and so in five days it's kind of hard to
