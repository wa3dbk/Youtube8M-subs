up with a couple of dragoons just stop

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.960 
up with a couple of dragoons just stop
this<00:00:15.059> from<00:00:15.240> happening<00:00:15.440> and<00:00:16.440> flash<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.279> going

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
this from happening and flash is going

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.849 
this from happening and flash is going
to<00:00:18.119> lose<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.359> SUV<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> very

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
to lose that SUV so not a very

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.750 
to lose that SUV so not a very
successful<00:00:20.070> scout<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:20.789> flash<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.480> far<00:00:22.760> but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
successful scout from flash so far but

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.460 
successful scout from flash so far but
he<00:00:24.029> does<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.930> his<00:00:24.960> star<00:00:25.619> port<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:27.019> I<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
he does have his star port up and I I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
he does have his star port up and I I
saw<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> control<00:00:29.250> towers<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.789> he's<00:00:29.910> probably

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
saw the control towers so he's probably

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.420 
saw the control towers so he's probably
going<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> dropship<00:00:31.650> yes<00:00:31.890> he<00:00:32.040> has<00:00:32.130> his<00:00:32.250> drop

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going for a dropship yes he has his drop

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
going for a dropship yes he has his drop
ship<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.790> he's<00:00:33.059> probably<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> drop<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
ship out he's probably going to drop a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
ship out he's probably going to drop a
couple<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.469> Tanks<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.309> saw<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.880> had<00:00:35.910> some

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
couple of Tanks now I saw they had some

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.639 
couple of Tanks now I saw they had some
tanks<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
tanks out so I don't think it's going to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
tanks out so I don't think it's going to
be<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> purely<00:00:38.190> vulture<00:00:39.090> drop<00:00:39.390> from<00:00:39.660> him<00:00:39.840> even

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
be a purely vulture drop from him even

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.990 
be a purely vulture drop from him even
though<00:00:40.500> he<00:00:40.739> definitely<00:00:41.100> could<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
though he definitely could do that I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.459 
though he definitely could do that I
think<00:00:42.120> it'd<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.719> effective<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> drop

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
think it'd be more effective to drop

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
think it'd be more effective to drop
some<00:00:43.680> tanks<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.219> maybe<00:00:44.700> try<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> defend<00:00:45.270> them

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
some tanks and maybe try to defend them

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.709 
some tanks and maybe try to defend them
with<00:00:45.570> Folgers<00:00:45.890> since<00:00:46.910> mostly<00:00:47.910> goon<00:00:48.239> army

with Folgers since mostly goon army

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.810 
with Folgers since mostly goon army
mostly<00:00:49.320> Dragoon<00:00:49.649> army<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.460> shuttle

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
mostly Dragoon army out for shuttle

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.069 
mostly Dragoon army out for shuttle
right<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:52.730> tanks<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> front<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.750> siege

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
right now tanks at the front with siege

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.830 
right now tanks at the front with siege
and<00:00:55.500> flash<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.370> getting<00:00:56.670> prepared<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.329> his

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and flash is getting prepared at his

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
and flash is getting prepared at his
natural<00:00:58.320> expansion<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> couple<00:00:59.250> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
natural expansion with a couple of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
natural expansion with a couple of
turrets<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.359> he's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> try<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> stop<00:01:01.500> her

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
turrets so he's going to try to stop her

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590 
turrets so he's going to try to stop her
ass<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.190> even<00:01:02.520> though<00:01:02.609> shuttle<00:01:02.910> hasn't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
ass there even though shuttle hasn't

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170 
ass there even though shuttle hasn't
been<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.019> harassing<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.040> his<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.760> far<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
been very harassing in his game so far I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
been very harassing in his game so far I
mean<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> last<00:01:06.869> game<00:01:07.049> he<00:01:07.260> did<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.860> harass<00:01:08.220> all

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
mean the last game he did not harass all

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.990 
mean the last game he did not harass all
that<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:09.560> there<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> siege<00:01:11.250> tank<00:01:11.610> drop

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that much there is the siege tank drop

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
that much there is the siege tank drop
from<00:01:12.630> flash<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:13.770> another<00:01:14.070> unit

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
from flash I think he has another unit

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
from flash I think he has another unit
or<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.390> well<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.869> oh<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> river

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
or two in there as well but oh the river

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.700 
or two in there as well but oh the river
comes<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.909> oh<00:01:18.659> man<00:01:19.080> kind

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
comes out just in time and oh man kind

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
comes out just in time and oh man kind
of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> major<00:01:20.159> fail<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:21.270> flash<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:22.020> had

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of a major fail from flash there he had

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.039 
of a major fail from flash there he had
a<00:01:22.229> couple<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> tanks<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.729> drop<00:01:24.420> ship<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
a couple of tanks and that drop ship but

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.640 
a couple of tanks and that drop ship but
those<00:01:25.200> tanks<00:01:25.590> didn't<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> whole<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.400> done

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
those tanks didn't get a whole lot done

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.140 
those tanks didn't get a whole lot done
and<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:28.770> shuttle<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.790> has<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and now shuttle I think has the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.580 
and now shuttle I think has the
advantage<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:30.900> has<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.229> rivers

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
advantage right here has some rivers

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.569 
advantage right here has some rivers
that<00:01:32.070> he<00:01:32.369> could<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.180> harassment<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:34.579> if

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that he could use for harassment here if

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
that he could use for harassment here if
he<00:01:35.820> drops<00:01:36.150> behind<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.930> flash<00:01:37.320> could<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
he drops behind here flash could have a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
he drops behind here flash could have a
very<00:01:37.890> hard<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.520> i<00:01:38.820> did<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.630> how<00:01:39.659> many

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
very hard time i did not see how many

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.899 
very hard time i did not see how many
turrets<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.770> had<00:01:40.979> around<00:01:41.250> his<00:01:41.369> main<00:01:41.640> i

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
turrets he really had around his main i

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.240 
turrets he really had around his main i
know<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.150> has<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.329> around<00:01:42.960> his<00:01:43.170> natural<00:01:43.770> but

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
know he has some around his natural but

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.139 
know he has some around his natural but

around his main to two shuttles out for

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.200 
around his main to two shuttles out for
shuttle<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.740> shuttle<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> living<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.090> his

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
shuttle so shuttle is living up to his

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
shuttle so shuttle is living up to his
name<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.750> he<00:01:52.320> has<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> couple<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.920> shuttles

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
name here he has a couple of shuttles

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
name here he has a couple of shuttles
out<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> he's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> pretty<00:01:54.659> much<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
out and he's going to pretty much I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.569 
out and he's going to pretty much I
think<00:01:55.530> he's<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.280> ferry

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
think he's going to use them to ferry

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.120 
think he's going to use them to ferry
his<00:01:56.759> troops<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.689> main<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.200> Flash's<00:01:58.860> here

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
his troops into the main of Flash's here

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
his troops into the main of Flash's here
which<00:01:59.729> could<00:02:00.119> work<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.630> could<00:02:00.899> not

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
which could work and it could not

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
which could work and it could not
because<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.710> two<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> lot<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
because there are two there are a lot of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.429 
because there are two there are a lot of
siege<00:02:03.119> tanks<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.750> actually<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.229> flash

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
siege tanks out here actually the flash

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.730 
siege tanks out here actually the flash
could<00:02:04.710> use<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> defend<00:02:05.250> his<00:02:05.490> main<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> flash

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
could use to defend his main so flash

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
could use to defend his main so flash
notices<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> quickly<00:02:09.209> enough<00:02:09.599> he<00:02:09.750> has<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
notices this quickly enough he has a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
the Wraith and shuttle is being a bit

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.230 
the Wraith and shuttle is being a bit
too<00:02:32.630> passive<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.920> defend<00:02:35.460> he's<00:02:36.090> not

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
too passive here to defend he's not

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.550 
too passive here to defend he's not

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
gonna be able to pick up that River I

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.900 
gonna be able to pick up that River I
don't<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:38.040> even<00:02:38.130> though<00:02:38.340> he<00:02:38.430> dropped<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
don't think even though he dropped a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.040 
don't think even though he dropped a
river<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:41.360> zealot<00:02:42.360> over<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> cause

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
river and a zealot over here to cause

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.630 
river and a zealot over here to cause
some<00:02:43.230> damage<00:02:43.410> he's<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.310> able<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
some damage he's going to be able to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330 
some damage he's going to be able to
disrupt<00:02:44.910> mining<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.690> long<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:45.840> he<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.340> but

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
disrupt mining for as long as he can but

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.280 
disrupt mining for as long as he can but
flash<00:02:47.580> still<00:02:47.880> has<00:02:48.120> his<00:02:48.300> Wraith<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.780> play<00:02:48.990> here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
flash still has his Wraith in play here

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.650 
flash still has his Wraith in play here
I<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:49.830> he's<00:02:49.920> going<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.220> guard<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.060> River

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
I think he's going to guard that River

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.460 
I think he's going to guard that River
and<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:52.440> keep<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.950> river<00:02:53.990> from<00:02:54.990> being<00:02:55.230> picked

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
and I keep the river from being picked

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.870 
and I keep the river from being picked
up<00:02:55.590> by<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.830> shuttles<00:02:56.250> even<00:02:56.520> though<00:02:56.580> shuttles

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
up by the shuttles even though shuttles

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.580 
up by the shuttles even though shuttles
trying<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> come<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.420> again<00:02:57.660> flash<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.410> going

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
trying to come in again flash it's going

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.110 
trying to come in again flash it's going
to<00:02:58.650> try<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.830> intercept<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.340> shuttles<00:02:59.790> he's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to try to intercept the shuttles he's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
to try to intercept the shuttles he's
going<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.390> try<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> fire<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.500> shuttles<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
going to try to fire on the shuttles and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.400 
going to try to fire on the shuttles and
get<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> shuttles<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:03.420> looks<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:03.960> shuttle

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
get the shuttles but looks like shuttle

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.470 
get the shuttles but looks like shuttle
is<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:05.250> saying<00:03:05.520> shuttle<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.850> lot<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.180> shuttle

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
is I'm saying shuttle a lot but shuttle

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
is I'm saying shuttle a lot but shuttle
drop<00:03:06.690> more<00:03:06.930> from<00:03:07.530> his<00:03:07.710> shuttles<00:03:08.040> down<00:03:08.250> here

drop more from his shuttles down here
has<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> couple<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.890> G<00:03:11.010> goons<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.960> think<00:03:12.960> you

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
has a couple of G goons I think you

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.360 
has a couple of G goons I think you
probably<00:03:13.140> should<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.590> more<00:03:13.800> troops<00:03:14.130> from

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably should have more troops from

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.940 
probably should have more troops from
two<00:03:14.880> shuttles<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:15.600> he<00:03:16.050> does<00:03:16.260> he<00:03:16.590> probably<00:03:16.770> has

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
two shuttles but he does he probably has

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.350 
two shuttles but he does he probably has
a<00:03:16.980> couple<00:03:17.190> more<00:03:17.400> troops<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.000> shuttles

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
a couple more troops and the shuttles

position<00:03:23.790> he's<00:03:23.910> dropping<00:03:24.300> all<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.570> his<00:03:24.690> troops

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
position he's dropping all of his troops

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.020 
position he's dropping all of his troops
here<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.290> he's<00:03:26.190> got<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:26.550> rid<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.760> stage

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
here but he's got to get rid of stage

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.260 
here but he's got to get rid of stage
taxes<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.660> rever<00:03:27.989> actually<00:03:28.350> goes<00:03:28.530> down<00:03:28.830> and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
taxes that rever actually goes down and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.060 
taxes that rever actually goes down and
the<00:03:30.270> siege<00:03:30.510> tank<00:03:30.780> being<00:03:31.020> repaired<00:03:31.560> there<00:03:31.890> by

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
the siege tank being repaired there by

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.790 
the siege tank being repaired there by
flash<00:03:32.489> even<00:03:32.940> though<00:03:33.030> he<00:03:33.120> lost<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.600> still<00:03:34.530> I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
flash even though he lost it still I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.350 
flash even though he lost it still I
think<00:03:34.980> shuttle<00:03:35.610> pretty<00:03:35.910> much<00:03:36.060> lost

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
think shuttle pretty much lost

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.240 
think shuttle pretty much lost
everything<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:37.020> that<00:03:37.110> attack<00:03:37.410> step<00:03:38.040> four

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
everything in that attack step four

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.830 
everything in that attack step four
shuttles<00:03:38.520> he<00:03:38.790> has<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> shuttle<00:03:39.209> shuttle<00:03:39.540> has

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
shuttles he has a shuttle shuttle has

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.360 
shuttles he has a shuttle shuttle has
the<00:03:39.959> shuttles<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.750> yes<00:03:42.750> flash<00:03:43.080> is<00:03:43.410> mining<00:03:43.890> once

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the shuttles so yes flash is mining once

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.870 
the shuttles so yes flash is mining once
again<00:03:44.700> at<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.060> three<00:03:45.300> o'clock<00:03:45.600> base<00:03:46.880> so

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
again at that three o'clock base so

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.780 
again at that three o'clock base so
flash<00:03:48.480> his<00:03:49.110> economy<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.800> doing<00:03:50.400> pretty<00:03:50.700> well

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
flash his economy is doing pretty well

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.430 
flash his economy is doing pretty well
right<00:03:51.060> now<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.239> don't<00:03:51.420> think<00:03:51.600> shuttle<00:03:52.170> really

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
right now I don't think shuttle really

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.800 
right now I don't think shuttle really
got<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.800> whole<00:03:53.250> lot<00:03:53.430> done<00:03:53.730> with<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.480> attack

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
got a whole lot done with that attack

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.300 
got a whole lot done with that attack
even<00:03:55.019> though<00:03:55.200> he<00:03:55.350> dropped<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.769> awful<00:03:56.070> lot<00:03:56.160> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
even though he dropped an awful lot of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.720 
even though he dropped an awful lot of
units<00:03:56.610> back<00:03:56.790> there<00:03:57.980> flash<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.220> very<00:03:59.459> quick<00:03:59.700> to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
units back there flash was very quick to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.180 
units back there flash was very quick to
run<00:04:00.180> his<00:04:00.600> SUV<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> don't<00:04:01.590> think<00:04:01.739> he<00:04:01.830> lost<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
run his SUV so I don't think he lost a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.610 
run his SUV so I don't think he lost a
lot<00:04:02.300> an<00:04:03.300> observer<00:04:03.840> going<00:04:04.140> down<00:04:04.320> there<00:04:04.470> for

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
lot an observer going down there for

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.190 
lot an observer going down there for
shuttle<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.130> shuttle<00:04:05.810> did<00:04:06.810> not<00:04:06.959> pull<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
shuttle so shuttle did not pull that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900 
shuttle so shuttle did not pull that
observe<00:04:07.680> her<00:04:07.800> back<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.100> time<00:04:08.280> but<00:04:08.580> he<00:04:08.670> did<00:04:08.820> get

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
observe her back in time but he did get

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.680 
observe her back in time but he did get
the<00:04:09.060> scout<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.680> at<00:04:10.680> least<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> left<00:04:11.280> side<00:04:11.489> of

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
the scout on at least the left side of

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.199 
the scout on at least the left side of
Flash's<00:04:12.690> base<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.760> shuttles<00:04:14.760> going<00:04:14.940> for

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
Flash's base and shuttles going for

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.000 
Flash's base and shuttles going for
another<00:04:15.360> heavy<00:04:15.780> economy<00:04:16.350> here<00:04:16.560> he<00:04:16.650> has<00:04:16.769> two

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
another heavy economy here he has two

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.250 
another heavy economy here he has two
bases<00:04:17.459> warping<00:04:18.209> in<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.480> believe<00:04:18.750> he<00:04:18.900> might<00:04:19.049> have

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
bases warping in I believe he might have

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.010 
bases warping in I believe he might have
one<00:04:19.530> up<00:04:19.739> already<00:04:20.280> but<00:04:20.880> his<00:04:21.239> fourth<00:04:21.539> base<00:04:21.720> is

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
one up already but his fourth base is

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.440 
one up already but his fourth base is
coming<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.500> soon<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.910> he's<00:04:24.030> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.210> try<00:04:24.419> to

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
coming in soon so he's going to try to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.300 
coming in soon so he's going to try to
out<00:04:24.660> macro<00:04:25.289> flash<00:04:25.620> which

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
out macro flash which

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.590 
out macro flash which
worked<00:04:26.430> out<00:04:26.550> very<00:04:26.610> well<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.180> last<00:04:27.360> game

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
worked out very well in the last game

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.840 
worked out very well in the last game
even<00:04:28.200> though<00:04:28.290> flash<00:04:28.530> took<00:04:28.800> down<00:04:28.950> a<00:04:28.980> lot<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
even though flash took down a lot of the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.230 
even though flash took down a lot of the
nexuses<00:04:30.419> next<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.650> don't<00:04:32.010> know<00:04:32.100> nexuses<00:04:32.850> he

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
nexuses next I I don't know nexuses he

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.800 
nexuses next I I don't know nexuses he
took<00:04:33.419> down<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.630> lot<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.990> them<00:04:35.120> shuttles<00:04:36.120> economy

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
took down a lot of them shuttles economy

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.960 
took down a lot of them shuttles economy
was<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.139> so<00:04:37.410> good<00:04:37.440> at<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.100> point<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.820> it

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
was just so good at that point that it

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.010 
was just so good at that point that it
didn't<00:04:39.210> even<00:04:39.270> matter<00:04:40.820> there's<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.910> hero<00:04:42.630> marine

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
didn't even matter there's a hero marine

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.240 
didn't even matter there's a hero marine
going<00:04:43.260> down<00:04:44.300> doing<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.510> for<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.810> Terrans

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
going down doing it for the Terrans

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.620 
going down doing it for the Terrans
there's<00:04:47.250> another<00:04:47.520> hero<00:04:47.820> marine<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.300> replace

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
there's another hero marine to replace

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.500 
there's another hero marine to replace
him<00:04:48.870> there<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.830> power<00:04:50.100> of<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.669> but<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.360> looks

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
him there the power of one but it looks

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.360 
him there the power of one but it looks
like<00:04:51.570> shuttles<00:04:52.470> coming<00:04:52.650> down<00:04:52.919> here<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.250> think

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
like shuttles coming down here I think

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.830 
like shuttles coming down here I think
he's<00:04:53.550> going<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.760> try<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.000> ferry<00:04:54.330> more<00:04:54.570> troops

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
he's going to try to ferry more troops

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.340 
he's going to try to ferry more troops
over<00:04:55.169> he's<00:04:55.590> moving<00:04:55.919> down<00:04:56.100> with<00:04:56.340> his<00:04:56.460> jaw<00:04:56.639> goons

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
over he's moving down with his jaw goons

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.540 
over he's moving down with his jaw goons
and<00:04:58.350> he<00:04:58.470> could<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.710> trying<00:04:58.889> to<00:04:59.070> protect<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.430> new

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
and he could be trying to protect a new

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.670 
and he could be trying to protect a new
base<00:04:59.760> actually<00:05:00.090> he's<00:05:00.690> moving<00:05:01.020> down<00:05:01.169> here<00:05:01.200> with

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
base actually he's moving down here with

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.430 
base actually he's moving down here with
a<00:05:01.860> probe<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.360> think<00:05:03.479> he<00:05:03.690> knows<00:05:03.900> about<00:05:04.080> this

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
a probe but I think he knows about this

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.719 
a probe but I think he knows about this
vulture<00:05:04.770> over<00:05:05.100> here<00:05:05.280> that's<00:05:05.400> why<00:05:05.610> he's

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
vulture over here that's why he's

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.670 
vulture over here that's why he's
bringing<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.090> his<00:05:06.210> troops<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:07.020> get<00:05:07.350> rid<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.530> the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
bringing in his troops to get rid of the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.110 
bringing in his troops to get rid of the
vulture<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.190> he<00:05:08.400> can<00:05:08.580> take<00:05:08.700> another<00:05:08.880> base

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
vulture so he can take another base

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.430 
vulture so he can take another base
right<00:05:09.300> here<00:05:09.360> in<00:05:09.570> flash<00:05:09.810> has<00:05:10.050> got<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.410> be

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
right here in flash has got to be

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.640 
right here in flash has got to be
suspicious<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.130> this<00:05:11.729> by<00:05:11.940> now<00:05:12.530> since<00:05:13.530> a

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
suspicious of this by now since a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.900 
suspicious of this by now since a
shuttle<00:05:13.979> is<00:05:14.010> going<00:05:14.280> for<00:05:14.430> such<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.639> heavy

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
shuttle is going for such a heavy

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.790 
shuttle is going for such a heavy
economy<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.630> flash<00:05:15.900> moves<00:05:16.229> in<00:05:16.410> right<00:05:16.620> now<00:05:16.740> he

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
economy the flash moves in right now he

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.840 
economy the flash moves in right now he
could<00:05:17.010> cause<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.250> ton<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:18.030> damage<00:05:19.520> he<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.639> coming

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
could cause a ton of damage he is coming

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.530 
could cause a ton of damage he is coming
in<00:05:21.030> right<00:05:21.210> now<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.470> think<00:05:22.680> flash<00:05:23.370> he<00:05:24.180> has<00:05:24.389> an

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
in right now so I think flash he has an

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.180 
in right now so I think flash he has an
awful<00:05:24.930> lot<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.050> Tanks<00:05:25.410> this<00:05:25.560> time<00:05:25.770> around<00:05:25.950> I

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
awful lot of Tanks this time around I

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.370 
awful lot of Tanks this time around I
think<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.460> learned<00:05:26.870> from<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> last<00:05:28.050> game

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
think you learned from the last game

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.840 
think you learned from the last game
he's<00:05:28.650> coming<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.010> now<00:05:29.100> trying<00:05:29.400> to<00:05:29.490> surround

he's coming in now trying to surround
the<00:05:30.240> Jew<00:05:31.229> goons<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.650> chickens<00:05:31.979> give<00:05:32.160> me<00:05:32.220> being

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the Jew goons the chickens give me being

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.250 
the Jew goons the chickens give me being
completely<00:05:32.940> surrounded<00:05:33.600> by<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.750> troops<00:05:34.110> of

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
completely surrounded by the troops of

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.400 
completely surrounded by the troops of
flashes<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.550> yeah<00:05:36.240> shuttles<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.169> major

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
flashes but yeah shuttles in major

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.950 
flashes but yeah shuttles in major
trouble<00:05:37.770> here<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.400> think<00:05:38.789> he<00:05:39.510> lost<00:05:39.690> all<00:05:39.900> of

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
trouble here I I think he lost all of

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.630 
trouble here I I think he lost all of
his<00:05:40.080> dragoons<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.590> that<00:05:40.740> engagement<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
his dragoons in that engagement and I

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.860 
his dragoons in that engagement and I
don't<00:05:41.910> think<00:05:42.030> he<00:05:42.150> has<00:05:42.240> enough<00:05:42.270> gateways<00:05:42.840> to

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
don't think he has enough gateways to

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.450 
don't think he has enough gateways to
really<00:05:43.260> fight<00:05:43.500> off<00:05:43.650> flash<00:05:43.950> right<00:05:44.160> now<00:05:44.280> I<00:05:44.340> think

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
really fight off flash right now I think

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.790 
really fight off flash right now I think
he<00:05:44.729> had<00:05:44.820> four<00:05:45.450> gateways<00:05:45.690> but<00:05:46.410> he<00:05:46.470> does<00:05:46.620> have

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
he had four gateways but he does have

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.469 
he had four gateways but he does have
harbored<00:05:47.070> a<00:05:47.160> tech<00:05:47.340> out<00:05:47.490> here<00:05:47.760> but<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> think<00:05:48.360> he

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
harbored a tech out here but I think he

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.060 
harbored a tech out here but I think he
switched<00:05:48.810> detect<00:05:49.200> a<00:05:49.320> little<00:05:49.530> bit<00:05:49.650> too<00:05:49.800> soon
