00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.160
There are countless paths for a
student navigating college life

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.630
including dozens of defined majors that
prepare one for a successful career

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.219
However a select few choose to blaze
their own trail

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.170
by creating a customized major tailored
to fit their unique talents

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.840
dual-sport athlete Shade Pratt is one of
those students.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.110
Being a student-athlete there's not
enough time in the day I would say.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.410
Doing two sports doesn't help either.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.540
I wake up go soccer practice.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
Go to class. Go to track practice.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.550
Go to lift. Go to class. Have a meeting.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.130
On top of that, I have away games or
away meets. I'm always traveling.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.320
I have a list of things to do for the day

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.190
and they all need to be checked before I
can go to bed.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.470
When she interacts with friends
and she

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.980
sees them doing anything that is
challenging.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
She becomes interested to find out more.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.760
When I was growing up, I did ballet and
tap.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.080
My brother played soccer and every time
they finished

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.159
a season they would get a trophy

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.900
and he would never let me touch it. She walked
into her brother's room

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.150
saw this trophy in there and tried to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.300
grab one of it. And her brother said "no"

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.330
put it down and that was her motivation
she changed

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.830
completely to become a soccer player.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.260
She likes challenges and she is

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.990
a great competitor

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.970
I think the one thing that you'll find in any
elite athlete is that they have to have a little

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.290
edge. She's a fierce competitor when she
gets on the track it's all about

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.810
business.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.930
Shade is very creative. She's

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.930
always drawing and designing things

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.680
Art allows me to express myself. I
love to draw.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.110
I carry my sketchbook around with me
everywhere. Just a way to get something

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.340
out on paper.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.400
It also inspires some of my

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.800
ideas for my actual art classes. One
of the best things about Maryland is the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.270
variety

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.270
of courses they offer. Here at Maryland they have
something called

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.600
IVSP Department individual studies
program that actually allows you to create your

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.319
own major

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.570
and I was thinking if I could put all

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.840
things that I love together which is art,
architecture,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.510
engineering, and sustainability then that would be like my dream major.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.510
I came up with design in the built
environment. It takes a brave student

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.060
to create an individual studies major
she's definitely not going along with

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.870
the crowd here but she's following her
own

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.430
star. I finally got into more

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.920
3D art classes where I was able to be more
hands-on

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740
create what I want to create and

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.560
it just exposed me to different materials
that I've never used before.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.380
On top of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.700
actual art, I love the arts. I like to
perform.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.200
I used to do plays in middle school.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.200
When it comes to preforming I like the
ability to collaborate with other people

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.600
and just the idea of what's going to make the
audience laugh.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.900
My biggest obstacle at Maryland was
figuring out exactly what I wanted to do.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.450
Because I'm just in to too much stuff

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.960
I think Maryland has allowed me to reach
my potential because it has allowed me to do

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.060
everything I love. So I'm really excited for what
the future has in store

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.640
I mean graduation is right around the
corner. I recently got drafted

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.540
to the national women's soccer league.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.540
and I'll be playing professional soccer after college.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.720
When I think about life after Maryland I think
about

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.239
how I'm gonna miss College Park. All the people I've met

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.980
Definitely my teammates. All the memories made here.
