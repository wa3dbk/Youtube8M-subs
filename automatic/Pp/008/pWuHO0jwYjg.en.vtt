00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
York I think that was a part of God's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.550 
York I think that was a part of God's
plan<00:02:32.870> didn't<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:34.020> about<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
plan didn't think about it the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.910 
plan didn't think about it the
opportunity<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.459> was<00:02:35.550> there<00:02:35.760> was<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.920> you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
opportunity that was there was was a you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.270 
opportunity that was there was was a you
know<00:02:38.270> awesome<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.739> style<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
know awesome and I think the style and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
know awesome and I think the style and
everything<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:42.030> over<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.330> playing<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
everything going over there playing and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
everything going over there playing and
then<00:02:43.860> being<00:02:44.580> able<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.280> better<00:02:47.280> season

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
then being able to have a better season

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.790 
then being able to have a better season
and<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.060> did<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.690> my<00:02:48.840> reg<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.080> year<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and I did it my reg a year and so I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.400 
and I did it my reg a year and so I
think<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:50.940> was<00:02:51.060> necessary<00:02:51.600> what<00:02:52.320> did

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
think the system some of the plays are

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.060 
think the system some of the plays are
very<00:03:10.970> similar<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:13.170> ones<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.680> ran<00:03:13.890> in
