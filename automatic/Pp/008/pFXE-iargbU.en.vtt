00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.329
 are for storing cartridges 4 including 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.430
 me it's mostly why I took 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.579
 because I have a shotgun and but 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.380

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.910
 from dano sonnex to the other side we find 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.490
 height and after you have a small 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.280
 pocket there which is very very very 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:53.250
 important lost room in this pocket 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 I often put debit that's because 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.690
 sometimes we go there in part it's a 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.910
 bit boring or so you can put 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.370
 a camel so for those who do not know 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.620
 not what it is it is a pocket of water 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
 that a pocket put you water 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.700
 have a pipe coming out and so that's it 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.800
 be done at the end next to the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.110
 mouth and you have except you drink 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.680
 this vest is adjustable thanks to 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.330

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.370
 you said with both scratches 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.290

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.690
 find him for fifty euros 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.390
