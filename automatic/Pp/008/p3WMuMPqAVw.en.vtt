 valid alternative to app player 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.240
 then or cracker for those who don't 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 he knew from a small program that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 need to buy everyone for free 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.640
 purchases within 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640
 applications 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.019
 maybe for games get coins 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.559
 or download additional packages 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.390
 or other things so you don't have to do 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.390
 other than going to cydia 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:01:07.660
 ok let's go on edit sources adds 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:15.650
 you have to write system point in par 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:17.899
 ap store.com slush oar slash 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.070
 I 've already arrived so you click 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.200
 on add raco once once 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.800
 downloaded 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.440
 here it is that this land here to open 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.970
 and you will find a single local app program 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.180
 store 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.300
 once downloaded this program 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.070
 you can buy all the packages 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.740
 additional from other things inside 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.350
 applications for free 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.649
 now I give you a little demonstration 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:55.780
 let's go to any game for 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.780
 example I know let's go jetpack 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:13.340
 let's go here we often go to shop 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:17.780
 I get coins I have very few months e 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.630
 what you conquer is that you are buying 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.660
 all if for any reason to ask 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.780
 itunes password do not put it 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.849
 absolutely because the point means 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.959
 that no view to charge 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.690
 here you really see in this case if 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 tells you confirm the purchase you give 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.590
 wait for the money to reach it 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.890
 same as you can see here above a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 31 million coins 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:04.849
 but each time he asks for confirmation 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:07.910
 this data to nothing is ok let's go to 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.980
 see another game we have are 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.090
 millions of coins to spend per 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.090
 any greedy 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:27.940
 let's open another game let's see for 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:27.940
 example I know his langa so much 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.200
 same thing we go to oin store network 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.310
 nor on the spot and let's add here to 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.470
 new confirm the purchase given nothing a 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.830
 nothing in the real money adds up 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.209
 same look up here 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.520
 so let's go on the characters that 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.520
 want to occupy can buy everything 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.340
 ok then obviously this program 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.780
 good enough or a good alternative 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.750
 which however does not work with all games 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.720
 and nothing for most I already have 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.880
 tried type i tried subway surfing 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.070
 the two time run jetpack fruit ninja not 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.370
 it works great 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.430
 or on razzle bought the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.200
 269 ​​premium version in this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.460
 program then without spending a 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.120
 hundredth 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.110
 so the video is finished if there is 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.669
 liked left I like to sign up 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.820

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.450
 short tutorial display recorder that you don't 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.010
 ios 6.1 is compatible with at least the 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.370
 cracked versions are not yet 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.850
 compatible and therefore the next video 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.590
 will be on how to download it for free 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.590
