00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.960
 Hello dear diary 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.899
 I'm neither "Forgive me that two lasted 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.899
 but for one thing, everything is pretty bad now 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.380
 Anyway, today it went to school 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.150
 in the morning in Zug 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.580
 he would stand and watch 30 minutes probably only time 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.380
 I set off on the journey 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.100
 and the new owner no neighbor has started that day 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.160
 The shooter cozy with a Family Guy episode 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.250
 his bill 20 minutes fifth and post one at 50 minutes then 8 to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.359
 to the 13th school 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.810
 that should be easy to arrive in Mainz 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.910
 the n-ergy test showed 94 percent of acute is left over there same 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.130
 Use five and a half hours shows that 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.220
 Ad hoc made on my gate and when later I tested it in the way in 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.560
 mastered the school 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.920
 the 45 minutes I have exactly one percentage point of battery cost the school day 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.320
 through the loose thus survive 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.360
 while accumulating over a normal leaves and pens 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.740
 usually only a book and me on the table of my possession 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 Unfortunately, there are not in the crucible AKW vehicle in digital form 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.570
 that would save a lot of weight 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 normal weather 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.050
 can be switched off quickly with me also the swapped Advent Easterland 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.850
 but felt strong but not 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 my often in test reports criticized keyboards by the way 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.159
 Splash proof is if you are not as negative as owner 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.180
 The Goose Tester gets used to everything 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.840
 leaving out an owner 23 girls are gathered shows up 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.979
 quickly the assembled femininity decides my name is now from 8 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 January 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.270
 well 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 in other years 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.870
 Berlin we were not raising any more 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.040
 RL to save energy you can get these testimonials screen is that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.740
 do not go 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.219
 a very nice feature that he has not received from any netbook office 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.939
 a special one among many I want to say because it is still synonymous 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.869
 on 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.389
 in Nierfeld Inc a sd card complete 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.839
 After this short break, the classmates had one directly 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:28.589
 devised another community 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.489
 zol 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.539
 not only in the reasoning 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.059
 it is 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.469
 Have October 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.049
 Alonso and Massa 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.600
 7 percent 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 special memories 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.109
 si why but that is unfortunately also Bahr 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.569
 Ltd. 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.869
 When did you say we are confident that we are with them? said Wulff 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.669
 we see 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.259
 1 no 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.320
 Dr 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840
 By the way, owners were particularly relieved when he saw it 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920
 you can not just as well create that on paper though that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.119
 but can only be achieved if its selection 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.409
 bought the shoulder strap and it finally went home from one 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.849
 Owner, moreover, in my opinion, I already had enough today 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:15.829
 participated 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.309
 many hours after the start of my working day there was still so much energy 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.870
 in me that owner still has enough power in the cells of a 6-cell battery 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.119
 Wall around using the hot spots of German Telekom at the station yet 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.030
 fast pixies how to upload 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.229
 and metrology 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.249
 you can expand the over the free use if you at home one 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.249
 DSL 16 thousand and a telephone flatrate type 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.989
 and because the school time with six lessons was combined with 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.109
 a publisher in the morning and briefly to varieties at the station still not too 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.909
 I was even able to do 10 o'clock on the way home with the rest of the team 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.839
 Episode Family Guy effect 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:49.949
 this is striking 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.790
 although a display reflects and who knows the theatrical hp2 distributed 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:59.129
 Game played Rimini 10 lets watch the episode wonderful withdrawal 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.120
 are for the federal government, during the day a survey by authorities 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.049
 be checked 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.049
 we should be our trouble 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.479
 I had to 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.289
 Why 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:12.959
 become 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.159
 that can be done, it is not always more 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.779
 do not know 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.820
 only the FC St with the countries 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.460
 one off 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.939
 yes what else Frankfurt 11 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.139
 felt his last days 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.110
 How to estimate the probability would be very distracting 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.570
 and who knows what he also said when the television FFC Frankfurt 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.910
 was about it 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.009
 what was done here 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.499
 he could not say 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.499
 that is what it means 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 So see you next time
