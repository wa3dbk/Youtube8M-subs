how<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.039> just<00:00:38.309> work<00:00:38.699> together<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:41.010> had

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
how do we just work together and we had

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.060 
how do we just work together and we had
spent<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.690> effort<00:00:43.109> it<00:00:44.070> took<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> us<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
spent so much effort it took to us the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
spent so much effort it took to us the
functionality<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.280> functional<00:00:48.149> part<00:00:48.449> was

everything and and the ergonomics in
progress<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.550> know<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.179> came

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
progress and you know and it just came

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
progress and you know and it just came
in<00:00:54.359> one<00:00:55.100> because<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.789> the

in one because it was you know the
ultimate<00:00:57.449> conservative<00:00:58.019> just<00:00:58.469> came<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.739> black

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
ultimate conservative just came in black

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
ultimate conservative just came in black
and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.089> us<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> big<00:01:01.109> deal<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and you know for us it was a big deal to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.970 
and you know for us it was a big deal to
put<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.800> blue<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.800> because

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
put up a blue one but that was because

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.950 
put up a blue one but that was because
we<00:01:05.460> sweep<00:01:05.970> me<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.690> sway<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> details

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
we sweep me really sway the details

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960 
we sweep me really sway the details
make<00:01:08.350> sure<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.860> me<00:01:09.340> both<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.760> right

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
make sure that me both the right

make sure that me both the right
foundation<00:01:10.500> something<00:01:11.500> we<00:01:11.619> can<00:01:11.770> keep

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
foundation something we can keep

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.969 
foundation something we can keep
building<00:01:12.220> on<00:01:12.549> years<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.690> years<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:13.990> years<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.640 
building on years and years of years and
and<00:01:15.340> we<00:01:15.670> also<00:01:15.820> came<00:01:16.240> up<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.570> UI<00:01:16.840> that<00:01:17.350> was

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
and we also came up with a UI that was

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.950 
and we also came up with a UI that was
