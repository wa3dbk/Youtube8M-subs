00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.210
 today I want to show you a little curiosity a little thing a lot 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.000
 fanciful in the world of no steam among the best dead time there is no end 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.760
 te.it has welcomed where you can endlessly retrieve the materials it shows of 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.679
 the first two points collected on TV the game I go in the herb collection mission of 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.460
 mountain 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.480
 has a village chief ironing 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.420
 obviously as you have seen I brought a lot of equipment 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.880
 simple opted for the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.439
 the armor mo fumoffu because 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 I also felt like protecting myself from the heat without having to bear me 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.039
 a research casino at 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.969
 I'm the guy decided to make this video perry very simple reason 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.399
 of wanting a mustard of that much ass we will have shown that not all of them 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.010
 know the facts p7s this 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.950
 great let's say in quotes to corrode programmer gone to figure out what it is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.500
 it is absolutely not something particularly useful or in any case not me 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 from no advantage does any action come into play from the cash desk and 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.790
 the wapoweb map also to show the collection points where they are located 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.440
 putting songs in order to be able to move faster I know that a little 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.460
 move inside the anus 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.070
 oo like the poisonous smoke bombs for you inside one of the areas where there is 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 that is, we are directing the 3 unfortunately zombe's then you shit your cock a lot 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.870
 as you know with the disappointed bomb we can immediately eliminate it without having to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.070
 go play a blind fly little throw ch ah if the state activated with 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.899
 high speed mind-picking ability to increase the speed of 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.409
 collecting the character I can assure you that this thing 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.550
 the influence absolutely no way 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.890
 the collection point in fact you can go there even naked 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 and you will see that the collection point will always remain infinite to increase 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.450
 the number of objects, however, of a collection point 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.390
 the denture. +22 deadlift all perfectly entered and left of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.999
 lentils collection on TV 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.689
 but in any case of collection +1 +2 we practically increase the collection 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.700
 descends so-called of a collection point gta 4 5 points 4 5 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.759
 maximum collection yamaha 7 8 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.149
 here instead guys we are talking really d in. honored who can 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.600
 really give objects 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.780
 without respite, while year 3 obviously gets rid of these quickly 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.939
 very nice and creatures 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.730
 that as always they lovingly break our own 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.129
 beloved zebedeans, I now take care of the vespoid, too, a great break from 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.499

 i love the gathering point and this one this as you know the nest let's say that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.979
 the creatures were sold here there are famous names heaps of bones 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.129
 I get to tennis to pick up if you want to see the high speed coast me 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.349
 allows you to collect objects at an absurd speed that belong to the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.899
 bad 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.069
 4 friends in pisa in the norm 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 5 an octopus of luck 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.149
 this page on lucky day even six 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.309
 7 my god 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:57.089
 8 wow seems to have activated collection +2 but not so 9 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.709
 even 10 I am here we begin to piacenza understand that there is something that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.679
 does not go 15 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.139
 12 go go go 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.869
 and I can safely continue so endlessly as you do access 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.479
 I can do too many things that I paint when I notice this thing I did the test 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.289
 and will cost 99 may 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.429
 and once practically the scart athens. recover 99 more without your own 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:25.599
 of this. 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.879
 who ever said 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.080
 it's something incredible not just saying I don't know if it's a mistake 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.159
 programmers 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.059
 ompro a feature of the game before race nuti insert to help football 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.609
 for beginners. of use I have already arrived pink moves I can 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.970
 quietly continue up to 30 40 50 and so on 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.609
 opaque tatoos only the first as mentioned all alright make-up is a lot 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.859
 useful for carafes no we recover the particularly rare subject 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.379
 we only recover bones but as explained all in itself for if nokia from 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.939
 show to revive something in kyukya the game as much as for 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.050
 show you a curiosity on Monday 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.050
 something a little fancy on tv + ventimiglia 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.129
 so much so that the continuous cycle 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.400
 bones. you have not already seen us start-ups that haunted the mission 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 of highly lissa will teach the headman so you know he is not 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:16.570
 absolutely a modified mission 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
 nor did he use a citadel 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.400
 we arrived 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.479
 at 34 on now I have given that in any case I cannot certainly continue the infinity - instead 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.419
 to show you the second collection point found in air number 6 - 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.419
 - interval that door 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.749
 obviously I equipped myself with this mature because as the resistance to the 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.080
 hot non-subcarrier hot drinks price 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.550
 queen this was still a quiet station there are no creatures 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.540
 pain in the neck that already alone cites thousands of miles away and does not harm us 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.539
 annoyance on a page 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.210
 and I'm going to recover 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.240
 here is the second collection point 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.610
 and how to know if I can recover cut stones on this mission 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.809
 I can only recover stones 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:06.450
 stones at the infinite work process done exactly before free 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.000
 stone on stone on foot on the foot vote so anti recovers those stones from 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.589
 be able to farmbot a whole god 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:17.839
 loved by the gumballs of stones to be thrown into consumption I'm going to be able to mazzarelli 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.210
 nothing special 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.629
 well guys like you saw 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.289
 I'm not hyper and doesn't ask me why this thing sadly exists 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.460
 I always think of you as a programmer 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.319
 but then later when I find out who will have there are also other points of 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.810
 collection scattered for other missions in other areas of the world, infinite center but 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.349
 always with objects that are creatively useless we look at examples of 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.629
 bach shells and bone stones 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.029
 hey romeo 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:48.349
 things like this I realized that maybe it was actually a thing 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.709
 wanted programmers to help you begin novice hunters 

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:53.280
 I honestly understand on a trip 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.770
 I don't even know if this is your name 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.080
 It is something you are trying to reflect in some way the reality of the game is there 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.639
 without minni minni lido 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.819
 it is normal to be able to collect hundreds and hundreds of oxide creatures that sauce 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.830
 quartered over the years by you 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.310
 dahab also comes to my life the republic habitat and so too ad 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.009
 example 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.560
 It is normal that says a rock wall like this is possible to recover 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.119
 hundreds of stones 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.099
 hermione idea however it is pro baggage shown the sake 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.690
 pay attention to the pros to make you 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.440
 it's a brilliant kid idea, there's nothing else to say like I said guys 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.040
 there are also other infinite collection points for other areas too 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.749
 of the world in other missions 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.370
 hey jupiter 4 34 wks 26 wording stone without ever stopping me 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.009
 and I could easily continue up to 99 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.509
 maybe I'll also make the other fly videos another video to show you too 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.210
 to you points collection even if I don't see how much I can be of help since 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.240
 it was but you know that there are and already this what effects the important thing said 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.119
 this is rationality, it adds not only my side
