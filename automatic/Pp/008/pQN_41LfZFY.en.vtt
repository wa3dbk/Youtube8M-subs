00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.730 
like a plucks the engineer back of it
because<00:01:58.480> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> but<00:01:59.020> these<00:01:59.140> Porsches<00:01:59.620> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
because of the but these Porsches the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.320 
because of the but these Porsches the
engine<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.490> rear<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.850> car<00:02:01.120> and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
engine is in the rear of the car and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.910 
engine is in the rear of the car and
then<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:01.990> finishes<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.530> off

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
then this finishes it off

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.670 
then this finishes it off
this<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.610> Samadhi<00:02:04.270> coming<00:02:04.780> in<00:02:04.930> drivers<00:02:05.470> side

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
this is Samadhi coming in drivers side

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.770 
this is Samadhi coming in drivers side
too<00:02:06.010> so<00:02:06.040> that's<00:02:06.400> never<00:02:06.850> nice<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.090> see<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:10.510> then

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
too so that's never nice to see and then

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.990 
too so that's never nice to see and then
somehow<00:02:11.020> Tony<00:02:11.410> Bates<00:02:11.680> will<00:02:11.980> get<00:02:12.490> involved<00:02:12.910> in

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
somehow Tony Bates will get involved in

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.720 
somehow Tony Bates will get involved in
this<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> theory<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.830> goes<00:02:15.520> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this and I have a theory that goes the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.520 
this and I have a theory that goes the
engine<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.270> was<00:02:16.450> exposed<00:02:16.870> because<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.320> rear

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
engine it was exposed because the rear

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.070 
engine it was exposed because the rear
had<00:02:17.650> been<00:02:17.800> pulled<00:02:18.040> off<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:20.680> will<00:02:20.890> inside

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
had been pulled off and that will inside

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.930 
had been pulled off and that will inside
meanwhile<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.410> from<00:02:23.830> Superbike<00:02:24.430> champion
