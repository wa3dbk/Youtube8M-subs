the<00:00:13.950> Samsung<00:00:14.610> r730<00:00:15.480> transfix<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> let's<00:00:19.230> start

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the Samsung r730 transfix so let's start

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890 
the Samsung r730 transfix so let's start
off<00:00:19.710> by<00:00:19.920> making<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.730> note<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.240> noting

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
off by making a note that this noting

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
off by making a note that this noting
that<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> two<00:00:22.830> kinds<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.279> material

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that this is a two kinds of material

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
that this is a two kinds of material
case<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.140> layer<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:27.420> durable<00:00:28.050> gel

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
case so the first layer is a durable gel

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.490 
case so the first layer is a durable gel
skin<00:00:29.390> very<00:00:30.390> flexible<00:00:31.050> very<00:00:33.380> durable<00:00:36.440> now<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
skin very flexible very durable now the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
skin very flexible very durable now the
second<00:00:38.100> portion<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.149> fully<00:00:39.629> poly

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
second portion is a fully poly

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
second portion is a fully poly
carbonated<00:00:40.710> case<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:42.480> features<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.950> design

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
carbonated case it features this design

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.930 
carbonated case it features this design
on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> back<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:48.739> here<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
on the back and here we have this this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
on the back and here we have this this
also<00:00:51.180> pattern<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> allows<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> grip<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
also pattern that allows you to grip the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.920 
also pattern that allows you to grip the
phone<00:00:53.399> easier<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> I'm<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.899> ahead

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
phone easier and I'm going to go ahead

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560 
phone easier and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:58.140> demonstrate<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.100> case<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> actual

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and demonstrate the case on the actual

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.020 
and demonstrate the case on the actual
phone<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:02.760> first

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
phone so we want to start off by first

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
phone so we want to start off by first
putting<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> first<00:01:03.809> layer<00:01:04.049> which<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
putting on the first layer which is to

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.219 
putting on the first layer which is to
silicone<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
silicone so we just put it on there and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.800 
silicone so we just put it on there and
then<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.240> ahead<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:11.810> incorporate

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
then we want to go ahead and incorporate

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.730 
then we want to go ahead and incorporate
the<00:01:12.990> second<00:01:13.380> piece<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
the second piece of it so we put on the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
the second piece of it so we put on the
case<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> polycarbonate<00:01:19.170> case<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:21.990> way

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
case the polycarbonate case and the way

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
case the polycarbonate case and the way
that<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.490> either<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:24.000> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that we do this is you can either do it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
that we do this is you can either do it
like<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.840> start<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:25.170> by

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
like that or you can start off by

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.190 
like that or you can start off by
actually<00:01:25.799> putting<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.400> silicone<00:01:26.909> inside<00:01:27.450> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
actually putting the silicone inside so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.510 
actually putting the silicone inside so
the<00:01:28.409> silicone<00:01:28.770> works<00:01:28.950> sort<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the silicone works sort of like a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
the silicone works sort of like a
cushion<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.920> like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
cushion so we want to put it in like

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100 
cushion so we want to put it in like
that<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.659> both<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> them

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that and then you just put both of them

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
that and then you just put both of them
on<00:01:34.320> together<00:01:34.799> until<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> snaps<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.210> which

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
on together until it snaps in which

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
on together until it snaps in which
would<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.720> easier<00:01:37.079> than<00:01:37.530> trying<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
would be easier than trying to do it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
would be easier than trying to do it
individually<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> second<00:01:40.380> part<00:01:40.409> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
individually and then the second part of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.679 
individually and then the second part of
it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.609 

we<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> snap<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.369> well

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.249 

in<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.970> most<00:01:56.119> important<00:01:56.540> part<00:01:56.750> when<00:01:56.960> doing

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
in the most important part when doing

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.749 
in the most important part when doing
this<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.650> actually<00:01:58.009> making<00:01:58.159> sure<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.580> all<00:01:58.729> of

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
this is actually making sure that all of

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.460 
this is actually making sure that all of
the<00:01:58.909> corners<00:01:59.210> snap<00:01:59.479> into<00:01:59.689> place<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.229> grip<00:02:00.440> the

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
the corners snap into place and grip the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.160 
the corners snap into place and grip the
phone<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.460> way<00:02:01.640> which<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.240> because<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:02.990> is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
phone that way which is because this is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.440 
phone that way which is because this is
a<00:02:03.200> slider<00:02:03.500> phone<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:04.009> doesn't<00:02:04.310> slide<00:02:04.549> off<00:02:04.610> or

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
a slider phone it doesn't slide off or

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.359 
a slider phone it doesn't slide off or
anything<00:02:05.690> like<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> once<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.680> are<00:02:06.860> using

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
anything like that once you are using

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.390 
anything like that once you are using
the<00:02:07.610> phone<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.729> once<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.180> on<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.370> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
the phone so once it's on there so that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.240 
the phone so once it's on there so that
silicone<00:02:14.030> works<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> cushion<00:02:15.190> kind<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
silicone works as a cushion kind of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.920 
silicone works as a cushion kind of
protection<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.940> whenever<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:17.540> drop<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
protection so whenever you do drop the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.600 
protection so whenever you do drop the
phone<00:02:18.110> or<00:02:18.290> anything<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.340> first

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
phone or anything like that the first

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.520 
phone or anything like that the first
part<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> poly<00:02:20.180> carbonated<00:02:20.750> part<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.260> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
part the poly carbonated part of it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.190 
part the poly carbonated part of it
absorbs<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.880> impact<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.569> then<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.870> inside

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
absorbs the impact and then the inside

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.750 
absorbs the impact and then the inside
works<00:02:24.410> as<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> cushion<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.340> doesn't<00:02:25.610> damage

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
works as a cushion so it doesn't damage

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.490
