attack<00:00:30.019> do<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.170> uppercut<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
attack do an uppercut because that's the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
by throwing another ice ball

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
by throwing another ice ball
as<00:00:39.780> soon<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.620> Goro<00:00:41.399> gets<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.300> hits<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
as soon as Goro gets up or hits the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.119 
as soon as Goro gets up or hits the
ground<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.960> soon<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.290> he<00:00:43.379> starts<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:43.980> up

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
ground as soon as he starts to get up

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.130 
ground as soon as he starts to get up
see<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:44.789> here

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
see what I'm doing here

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.180 
see what I'm doing here
rewind<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> want<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.950> again

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
rewind that if you want to see it again

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
rewind that if you want to see it again
and<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.489> through<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.789> annoying<00:00:48.390> talking<00:00:48.660> again

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and go through my annoying talking again

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
and go through my annoying talking again
that<00:00:49.590> might<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.920> difficult<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.520> whatever<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that might be difficult but whatever so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200 
that might be difficult but whatever so
yeah<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> lose<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> second<00:00:53.760> round<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
yeah I lose the second round here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.380 
yeah I lose the second round here
somehow<00:00:55.100> probably<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> his

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
somehow probably because all of his

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.920 
somehow probably because all of his
moves<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.809> overpowered<00:00:59.210> anyway<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.270> yeah<00:01:00.600> as

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
moves are overpowered anyway so yeah as

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
moves are overpowered anyway so yeah as
soon<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> land<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.609> freeze<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
soon as you land that first freeze you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
soon as you land that first freeze you
pretty<00:01:03.420> much<00:01:03.600> win<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> round<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
pretty much win the round because you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
pretty much win the round because you
throw<00:01:05.220> another<00:01:05.519> ice<00:01:05.760> ball<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.840> Goro

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
throw another ice ball right when Goro

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
throw another ice ball right when Goro
hits<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> ground<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.070> uppercut<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
hits the ground from your uppercut and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
hits the ground from your uppercut and
you<00:01:09.000> keep<00:01:09.240> freezing<00:01:09.630> him<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> keep

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
you keep freezing him and you keep

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
you keep freezing him and you keep
demolishing<00:01:10.860> him<00:01:11.040> however<00:01:11.729> sometimes<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
demolishing him however sometimes that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
demolishing him however sometimes that
will<00:01:12.720> happen<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.110> he's<00:01:13.229> too<00:01:13.439> low<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.920> an

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
will happen when he's too low for an

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.340 
will happen when he's too low for an
uppercut<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:14.970> smacks<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.170> death

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
uppercut and then he smacks you to death

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
uppercut and then he smacks you to death
like<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:18.380> round<00:01:19.380> 3<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.100> wonder<00:01:20.670> what's<00:01:20.850> going

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
like that round 3 I wonder what's going

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.130 
like that round 3 I wonder what's going
to<00:01:21.330> happen<00:01:24.200> jump<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.850> also<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.479> AI<00:01:27.659> can

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to happen jump back also the AI can

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
to happen jump back also the AI can
catch<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.040> spamming<00:01:29.369> ice<00:01:29.640> balls

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
catch on that you're spamming ice balls

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.370 
catch on that you're spamming ice balls
a<00:01:30.090> lot<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> try<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.780> switch<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
a lot so try and switch it up with a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
a lot so try and switch it up with a
jump<00:01:31.650> kick<00:01:31.860> every<00:01:32.130> once<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> while<00:01:32.670> see

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
jump kick every once in a while see

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.819 
jump kick every once in a while see
there's<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> first<00:01:33.960> uppercut<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.680> some

there's the first uppercut for some
reason<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.189> jumped<00:01:35.400> backwards<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.740> I'm

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
reason that jumped backwards there I'm

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
reason that jumped backwards there I'm
trying<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> get<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.549> AI<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.450> always

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
trying to get the AI to think I'm always
