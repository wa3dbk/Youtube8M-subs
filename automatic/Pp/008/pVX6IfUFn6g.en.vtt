other small tutorial on a small floating
glitch<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.139> inferno<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.400> might<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.000> seen<00:00:12.210> it

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.870 
glitch on inferno you might have seen it
before<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:12.860> it<00:00:13.860> was<00:00:14.009> patched<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.820> you

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
before but it was patched out so you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.599 
before but it was patched out so you
couldn't<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> new<00:00:16.410> patch<00:00:16.770> it

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
couldn't do it but with the new patch it

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.529 
couldn't do it but with the new patch it
still<00:00:18.330> works<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.789> it<00:00:20.789> will<00:00:21.000> basically<00:00:21.210> take

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
still works so it will basically take

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.250 
still works so it will basically take
you<00:00:21.960> from<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.640> up<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.720> you

small<00:00:30.510> ledge<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.140> yes<00:00:32.130> jump<00:00:32.579> forward<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
small ledge and yes jump forward it so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
small ledge and yes jump forward it so
you<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.800> practice<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.550> or

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you don't have to practice this or

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.209 
you don't have to practice this or
anything<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:37.980> good

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
anything really so it's a really good

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
anything really so it's a really good
spot<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:39.020> lightning<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.290> using<00:00:40.530> such

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
spot for lightning and you're using such

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.779 
spot for lightning and you're using such
again<00:00:41.660> now<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> also<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
again now you can also get up on the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
again now you can also get up on the
other<00:00:44.969> side<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.559> will<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
other side but then you will have to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.080 
other side but then you will have to
strafe<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.379> try<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.070> spot<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
strafe and try a on that spot so you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.330 
strafe and try a on that spot so you
will<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:51.870> write<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.940> try<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
will then write that and we can try that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.439 
will then write that and we can try that
it's<00:00:56.340> quite<00:00:56.820> hard<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> beginning<00:00:57.930> like

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
it's quite hard in the beginning like

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.689 
it's quite hard in the beginning like
that<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.230> stand<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.520> jump

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that now we stand here and we can jump

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.910 
that now we stand here and we can jump
up<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.769> think<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.460> spot<00:01:06.290> gives<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.590> more

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
up I think this spot gives you more

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.789 
up I think this spot gives you more
visibility<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.840> hides<00:01:10.260> zipper

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
visibility and it actually hides zipper

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.929 
visibility and it actually hides zipper
so<00:01:12.290> person<00:01:13.290> personally<00:01:13.979> I'd<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.970> jump

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
so person personally I'd I do this jump

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.410 
so person personally I'd I do this jump
one<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.180> spot<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:20.420> standing

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
one more spot on the a side is standing

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.580 
one more spot on the a side is standing
on<00:01:21.680> dislodge<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.759> also<00:01:24.439> give<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
on dislodge which can also give you a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
on dislodge which can also give you a
pretty<00:01:25.860> nice<00:01:26.070> mini<00:01:26.549> diffuse<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.689> a

as you see I'm getting pulled backward
so<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.720> back<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.730> jump<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.510> found<00:02:45.720> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so I back of it and jump and I found it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.490 
so I back of it and jump and I found it
since<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.239> want<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.720> jump<00:02:48.930> underneath

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
since I know I want to jump underneath

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
since I know I want to jump underneath
it<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.950> could<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.790> pull<00:02:51.030> backwards<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:51.810> are

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it I could get to pull backwards so are

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.759 
it I could get to pull backwards so are
you<00:02:52.200> step<00:02:52.470> out<00:02:52.739> one<00:02:53.250> step<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.760> easy<00:02:54.209> peasy<00:02:54.769> so

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
you step out one step and easy peasy so

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.080 
you step out one step and easy peasy so
it's<00:02:55.950> good<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:57.239> my<00:02:57.720> last<00:02:57.959> little<00:02:58.530> trick<00:02:58.859> is<00:02:59.370> a
