00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.110 

so<00:00:18.760> DG<00:00:19.060> for<00:00:19.300> the<00:00:19.390> space<00:00:19.630> are<00:00:20.170> lame<00:00:21.130> tanks<00:00:21.610> and

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
so DG for the space are lame tanks and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.110 
so DG for the space are lame tanks and
like<00:00:22.960> tanks<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:24.010> there's<00:00:24.520> another<00:00:24.910> problem

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120 
like tanks and there's another problem

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.710 
like tanks and there's another problem
in<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.660> GI<00:00:25.869> based<00:00:26.310> they<00:00:27.310> have<00:00:27.520> material

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
in the GI based they have material

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.550 
in the GI based they have material
fields<00:00:28.720> right<00:00:29.080> at<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.530> south<00:00:29.770> of<00:00:30.040> their<00:00:30.250> base

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
fields right at the south of their base

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:45.900 
fields right at the south of their base
it's<00:00:32.560> hard<00:00:32.830> to<00:00:33.100> combine<00:00:33.550> them<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.520> what<00:00:45.700> else

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
it's hard to combine them so what else

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.680 
it's hard to combine them so what else
could<00:00:46.629> we<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:47.370> put<00:00:48.370> up<00:00:48.489> sandbags<00:00:48.730> up<00:00:49.030> here<00:00:49.390> and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
could we do put up sandbags up here and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.860 
could we do put up sandbags up here and
drop<00:00:50.470> images<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.739> tanks<00:00:54.220> need<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:55.030> go<00:00:55.659> this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
drop images so the tanks need to go this

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:05.730 
drop images so the tanks need to go this
way<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:02.530> buggy<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:03.070> clear<00:01:03.790> out<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.740> area

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
way not buggy and clear out the area

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:43.830 
way not buggy and clear out the area
here

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:58.840 

I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.920> all<00:01:51.159> game<00:01:51.490> for<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.880> first<00:01:52.060> time<00:01:52.210> now

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:39.940 

for<00:01:59.850> coming

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.470 

I<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.790> know<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.660> bought<00:02:42.379> this<00:02:42.530> at<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.890> cost<00:02:43.480> they

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
I do I know I bought this at a cost they

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:54.809 
I do I know I bought this at a cost they
stay<00:02:45.050> here

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:10.110

inside the face

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:30.500 
inside the face
no<00:05:11.970> entryway<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:27.330> could<00:05:27.540> use<00:05:27.840> engineers<00:05:29.510> that

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
no entryway we could use engineers that

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.820 
no entryway we could use engineers that
slip<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.170> here

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
slip in here

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:39.740 
slip in here
but<00:05:37.430> first<00:05:38.430> let's<00:05:38.640> build<00:05:38.910> up<00:05:39.120> speaker<00:05:39.540> tech

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
but first let's build up speaker tech

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.320 
but first let's build up speaker tech
for<00:05:42.170> the<00:05:43.170> combination<00:05:43.770> between<00:05:44.000> units<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.270> to

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
for the combination between units is to

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:54.590 
for the combination between units is to
use<00:05:47.420> in<00:05:48.420> combination<00:05:49.080> with<00:05:50.840> latex<00:05:53.420> you<00:05:54.420> will

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
use in combination with latex you will

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.589 
use in combination with latex you will
love<00:05:54.810> them

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
love them

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.159 
love them
I<00:05:56.629> know<00:05:57.499> in<00:05:57.679> my<00:05:57.800> speed<00:05:58.039> running<00:05:58.429> i<00:05:58.610> punish<00:05:59.059> you

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
I know in my speed running i punish you

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.029 
I know in my speed running i punish you
needed<00:06:00.169> my<00:06:00.349> Unisphere<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.550> blade<00:06:02.300> brought<00:06:03.039> in

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
needed my Unisphere and blade brought in

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.570 
needed my Unisphere and blade brought in
a<00:06:04.159> lie<00:06:04.569> and<00:06:05.569> disappearances<00:06:06.499> here<00:06:06.770> was<00:06:07.159> empty

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
a lie and disappearances here was empty

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.909 
a lie and disappearances here was empty
at<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:08.029> helm<00:06:08.389> in<00:06:08.539> the<00:06:08.599> harvester<00:06:09.080> come<00:06:09.409> always

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
at the helm in the harvester come always

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.959 
at the helm in the harvester come always
this<00:06:10.129> late<00:06:10.569> and<00:06:11.569> was<00:06:11.839> already<00:06:12.409> destroyed<00:06:12.969> that

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
this late and was already destroyed that

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.269 
this late and was already destroyed that
was<00:06:14.209> a<00:06:14.240> great<00:06:14.479> thing

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
was a great thing

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.800 
was a great thing
well<00:06:17.089> the<00:06:17.719> see<00:06:18.319> here<00:06:18.529> deterrent

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
well the see here deterrent

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.230 
well the see here deterrent
and<00:06:21.380> I<00:06:22.300> will<00:06:23.320> try<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.350> attack<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.370> face<00:06:25.550> from

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
and I will try to attack the face from

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.730 
and I will try to attack the face from
this<00:06:26.510> side<00:06:26.780> here<00:06:27.110> so<00:06:27.820> I<00:06:28.820> avoid<00:06:29.330> my<00:06:29.840> unit<00:06:30.440> to<00:06:30.620> be

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
this side here so I avoid my unit to be

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.420 
this side here so I avoid my unit to be
destroyed<00:06:31.160> by<00:06:31.370> his<00:06:31.730> type

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.870 

children<00:06:35.770> and<00:06:36.770> I<00:06:36.890> think<00:06:37.100> dance<00:06:37.340> how<00:06:37.610> are<00:06:37.790> you

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
children and I think dance how are you

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.030 
children and I think dance how are you
doing<00:06:38.090> this

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
doing this

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.950 
doing this
units<00:06:40.040> come<00:06:40.220> from<00:06:40.250> you<00:06:43.240> go<00:06:44.240> this<00:06:44.450> way<00:06:44.510> and

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
units come from you go this way and

00:06:44.960 --> 00:07:03.240 
units come from you go this way and
destroy<00:06:45.770> the<00:06:45.890> base<00:06:46.100> from<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:59.240> next<00:06:59.450> part
