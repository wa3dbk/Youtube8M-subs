 first by drawing on the board or 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.620
 bag future rifles killed you 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.230
 billet then for the rough department and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.770
 Shaped rifle machined 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:23.539
 planer need to consider that if the board is not 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.470
 planed it needs to be processed to 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.470
 she was smooth 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.580
 for processing hard to reach places 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.240
 used grinding machine or 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.240
 file

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.650
 machine tool 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.780
 attached to the hard drive 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.400
 for strength, you can attach a screw 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.640
 now you need to make lead plates 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.640
 as on the winchester 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.860
 drill holes and make them pkkine 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.250
 fasten them to the hard drive 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.440
 it remains to make the barrel barrel do with 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.129
 aluminum tube we drill in it 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.129
 three holes 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.910
 two holes will be for mounting from 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.300
 fly hole lever 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.300
