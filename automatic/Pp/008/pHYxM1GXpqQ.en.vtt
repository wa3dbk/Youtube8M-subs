right<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:04.900> let's<00:03:05.650> see<00:03:05.980> what<00:03:06.159> this<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.549> as<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
right so let's see what this I is as a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.589 
right so let's see what this I is as a
truck<00:03:07.859> drove<00:03:08.859> up<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.670> did<00:03:10.150> something
