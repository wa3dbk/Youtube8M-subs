00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 free 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.559
 many will say that it's fairy tale and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.480
 you summon a compass 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.350
 complicated after I wanted to arbas him 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.930

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 I'm not first but I did 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:29.090
 3rd 3rd 3rd and was already pretty much tried 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.090
 the first words a little long issue 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.759
 while you have my campaign in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.150
 Mardi Gras are everywhere I have 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 continued the campaign then here at each 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.540
 times the overflow to copy data 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.930
 you can recover a little long 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.230
 just resume everything well it's okay 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.110
 to give you the coast is a pity that's 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.990
 that the hack or walk or free at a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.180
 times you have to recharge at home my 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.930
 parents have all made me a ko on a little 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.620
 remote and where the movie these officers by 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.110
 a caucasian 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.030
 after you want to start over it is 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.760
 revived but the problem was dying 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 to restart the campaign make you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.430
 wire be like that makes us a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.370
 action you change that too it's 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:36.150
 my records 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:48.030
 otherwise you throw chaos or 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:57.599
 around the world 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:03:02.909
 also after a lot of bullets 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.590
 you can die here but that's enough 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:08.280
 to love the world at the mail info com or 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.870

 have voted believe a little fuzzy - this is his 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.819
 embarrassment not really a good faith you 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:33.230
 naming to go see your cons screen 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.489
 takes place where we can see shards 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.990
 follow our very little a real role and 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.440
 humor 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.840

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.580
 postal workers 28 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.560
 unless they do not have much with combos 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.770
 few of me at the combo are in 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.020
 question of 28 the salvation the dudes get 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.600
 would be a little too easy it is the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:04.820
 combo a language is a pioneer does that 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.930
