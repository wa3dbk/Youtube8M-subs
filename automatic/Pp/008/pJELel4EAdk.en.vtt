it's<00:00:28.920> quite<00:00:29.160> different<00:00:29.369> eighty<00:00:29.730> percent<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it's quite different eighty percent of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
it's quite different eighty percent of
the<00:00:30.330> parts<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.810> new<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.619> Hawkeyes<00:00:32.040> lighter

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the parts are new the Hawkeyes lighter

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.319 
the parts are new the Hawkeyes lighter
we<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:34.110> room<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.350> balance<00:00:34.890> weight<00:00:35.329> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
we have more room for balance weight we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.049 
we have more room for balance weight we
have<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> longer<00:00:36.690> wheelbase<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.910> we

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
have a longer wheelbase and I think we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:01:03.979 
have a longer wheelbase and I think we
are<00:00:39.149> aerodynamically<00:00:39.390> stronger

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.780 

well<00:01:04.989> aerodynamic<00:01:05.830> has<00:01:05.979> been<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.310> weak<00:01:06.460> spot

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
well aerodynamic has been the weak spot

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.420 
well aerodynamic has been the weak spot
for<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.930> our<00:01:08.020> last<00:01:08.290> two<00:01:08.590> current<00:01:08.920> cars<00:01:09.130> and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
for for our last two current cars and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
for for our last two current cars and
that<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.820> where<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.090> mostly<00:01:11.049> focused<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.450> well

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
that is where we mostly focused and well

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.289 
that is where we mostly focused and well
it<00:01:13.840> was<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.049> hard<00:01:14.350> work<00:01:14.560> hard<00:01:15.009> winter<00:01:15.399> for<00:01:16.240> all

it was a hard work hard winter for all
the<00:01:16.450> guys<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:17.049> many<00:01:17.740> areas<00:01:18.119> mainly<00:01:19.119> focus<00:01:19.600> on

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
the guys in many areas mainly focus on

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:34.260 
the guys in many areas mainly focus on
arrow<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:21.729> hope<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.180> pays<00:01:22.360> out

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.870 

the<00:01:34.899> first<00:01:35.140> drive<00:01:35.439> of<00:01:35.469> my<00:01:35.920> new<00:01:36.100> car<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:36.520> good

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the first drive of my new car was good

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.090 
the first drive of my new car was good
everything<00:01:37.659> was<00:01:37.899> working<00:01:38.079> as<00:01:38.289> planned<00:01:38.469> he'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
everything was working as planned he'll

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.310 
everything was working as planned he'll
very<00:01:39.369> compact<00:01:39.820> agile<00:01:40.359> nice<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.840> drive<00:01:41.049> good

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
very compact agile nice to drive good

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:54.730 
very compact agile nice to drive good
feeling<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.280> good<00:01:43.030> positive<00:01:43.299> side

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.950 

we<00:01:55.740> must<00:01:56.040> move<00:01:56.250> forward<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:57.060> must<00:01:57.090> we've<00:01:57.840> had

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
we must move forward we must we've had

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.110 
we must move forward we must we've had
two<00:01:58.260> seasons<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.890> forth<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.940> world

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
two seasons of forth in the world

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.280 
two seasons of forth in the world
championship<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.690> that's<00:02:00.870> not<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.260> enough

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
championship and that's not good enough

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
championship and that's not good enough
so<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.430> must<00:02:02.640> move<00:02:02.850> forward<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.960> dream<00:02:04.920> would

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so we must move forward my dream would

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.250 
so we must move forward my dream would
be<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.910> Michael<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> win<00:02:06.480> again<00:02:06.780> Anthony

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
be for Michael to win again Anthony

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.920 
be for Michael to win again Anthony
queda<00:02:07.620> won<00:02:07.800> his<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.490> race<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:09.690> our

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
queda won his first race so that's our

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:23.460 
queda won his first race so that's our
ambition<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.070> objective

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.530
