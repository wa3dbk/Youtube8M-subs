starting to get into bait casters and
everything<00:00:22.050> because<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> usually<00:00:23.130> use

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
everything because I usually use

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.599 
everything because I usually use
spinning<00:00:23.730> reels<00:00:24.529> but<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:26.099> tell<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
spinning reels but what I can tell you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.390 
spinning reels but what I can tell you
is<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> very<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.680> smooth<00:00:29.070> reel

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
is that this is a very very smooth reel

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.170 
is that this is a very very smooth reel
as<00:00:29.699> five<00:00:30.539> ball<00:00:31.109> bearings<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.940> think<00:00:32.940> that's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
as five ball bearings I think that's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.690 
as five ball bearings I think that's
what<00:00:33.360> they're<00:00:33.480> called<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.540> has<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
what they're called on these it has this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.930 
what they're called on these it has this
little<00:00:38.700> lever<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.860> little<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:42.590> don't<00:00:43.590> know

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
little lever or little I don't know

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.729 
little lever or little I don't know
button<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.120> guess<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> does<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
button I guess and what it does is it

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
button I guess and what it does is it
fixes<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.730> lets<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.180> hold<00:00:51.360> down<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
fixes or it lets you hold down the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.310 
fixes or it lets you hold down the
button<00:00:52.730> for<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.090> casting<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:55.170> you
