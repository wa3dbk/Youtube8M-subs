00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 there folks we'll learn how to do 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 a screen recording of the pc and consumes 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.049
 using every box 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.609
 first we will download the atube enter 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:24.600
 on google it's people all over him 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:26.310
 in the countryside and in the bajaki there is an actor who 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.680
 I will not download because I already have 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.540
 installed easy installation 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 this is the last version of it 29.3 47 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.480
 after installation to the configuration 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:55.110
 In order to make the recording we will 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 use the record if you click on the area 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.640
 he wants to do the recording in which area 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the screen 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.420
 wanted to make the recording if 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 window 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 it will show the entire window active 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.229
 of the pc that is the ideal 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 it will already enter the settings 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:25.830
 Direct audio here would be volume for 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 the main or depending on the audio 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.490
 of the tpc it will appear to you as a mixer 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.689
 make the folder on the desktop a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.930
 new folder where video will be saved 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.509
 the nano in the videos folder here you will not 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.579
 be saved to my video folder 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.670
 here's our box 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.399
 if you mark it here it is to determine the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.960
 time for him to stop 60 seconds two 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.750
 Minutes two minutes here Minimize at 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.150
 beginning would be when to put initial everything 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.120
 to do the recording he 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.640
 the screen of the biacchi act already falls out and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.329
 starts recording your area 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.709
 of work 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:26.349
 the cursor remember it will make the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.260
 mouse pointer recording 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.739
 follow the mouse it goes 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.620
 when you move the mouse is the screen 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.310
 will fiddle with the hacksaw 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.659
 also interesting because it gives a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:48.310
 shortcut to start stop or play in the 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.859
 screen on the f7 keys f-18 and / f 9 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.129
 then that's it 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.519
 until the next video and good luck to 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.519
 you
