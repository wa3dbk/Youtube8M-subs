think that the most interesting moment

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
think that the most interesting moment
in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> game<00:00:59.640> actually<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.690> dismissal

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
in the game actually was the dismissal

in the game actually was the dismissal
of<00:01:01.289> Tendulkar<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> saw<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.730> faces

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
of Tendulkar and you saw the the faces

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
of Tendulkar and you saw the the faces
on<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> crowd<00:01:03.570> complete<00:01:04.110> disbelief<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.070> he

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
on the crowd complete disbelief and he

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
on the crowd complete disbelief and he
got<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> sense<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> even<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.659> he<00:01:07.110> doesn't

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
got a sense that even when he doesn't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.899 
got a sense that even when he doesn't
fire<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> even<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.340> he<00:01:08.400> doesn't<00:01:08.580> cause

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
fire and even when he doesn't cause

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
fire and even when he doesn't cause
victories<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:09.840> carries<00:01:10.170> such<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> burden

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of hope and expectation and I think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270 
of hope and expectation and I think
probably<00:01:13.200> listening<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> Indian

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
probably listening to what the Indian

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.370 
probably listening to what the Indian
players<00:01:14.520> said<00:01:14.880> afterwards<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:16.229> they

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
players said afterwards and how they

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
players said afterwards and how they
spoke<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> victory<00:01:17.700> meant<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
spoke about what the victory meant to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.289 
spoke about what the victory meant to
them

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
them

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.520 
them
you've<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> feeling<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> probably<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you've got the feeling that probably the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.870

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
terms of hopes and expectations I think

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030 
terms of hopes and expectations I think
would<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.329> crushed<00:02:18.689> many<00:02:19.349> lesser<00:02:19.680> men<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
would have crushed many lesser men I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.220 
would have crushed many lesser men I
think<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.150> he's<00:02:21.360> dealt<00:02:21.659> with<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
think the way he's dealt with that and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.750 
think the way he's dealt with that and
the<00:02:22.290> dignity<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.040> restraint<00:02:23.549> he's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the dignity and the restraint he's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490 
the dignity and the restraint he's
showed<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.209> everything<00:02:24.510> he's<00:02:24.629> done<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.170> think

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
showed and everything he's done I think

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.199 
showed and everything he's done I think
was<00:02:25.769> reflected<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> way<00:02:26.549> people<00:02:26.640> spoke

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
was reflected in the way people spoke

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.880 
was reflected in the way people spoke
about<00:02:27.510> him<00:02:27.659> on<00:02:27.750> his<00:02:27.900> own<00:02:27.959> team<00:02:28.260> tonight<00:02:28.560> there

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.009 
about him on his own team tonight there
was<00:02:28.950> almost<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.280> sense<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.670> saying<00:02:29.970> okay<00:02:30.780> well

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
was almost a sense of saying okay well

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.869 
was almost a sense of saying okay well
he<00:02:31.409> didn't<00:02:31.680> win<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.799> for<00:02:32.069> us<00:02:32.159> tonight<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.760> we

he didn't win it for us tonight but we

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.490 
he didn't win it for us tonight but we

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
Indian cricket and for India over the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.069 
Indian cricket and for India over the
last<00:02:38.370> 20<00:02:38.790> years<00:02:38.819> we<00:02:39.269> were<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.720> looking<00:02:39.840> at

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
last 20 years we were just looking at

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.360 
last 20 years we were just looking at
pictures<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.590> team<00:02:40.799> there<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.159> they<00:02:41.250> look

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
pictures of the team there and they look

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.680 
pictures of the team there and they look
absolutely<00:02:41.640> strung<00:02:42.150> out<00:02:42.299> sort<00:02:42.629> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
absolutely strung out sort of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.740 
absolutely strung out sort of
emotionally<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.439> he<00:02:43.950> looks<00:02:44.549> he<00:02:45.359> always<00:02:45.510> looks

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
emotionally and he looks he always looks

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.250 
emotionally and he looks he always looks
sort<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.930> dead<00:02:46.140> calm<00:02:47.239> yeah<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.269> think<00:02:48.450> that's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
sort of dead calm yeah I think that's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
sort of dead calm yeah I think that's
partly<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.739> illusion<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.280> think<00:02:50.519> sports<00:02:50.819> run

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
partly an illusion I think sports run

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.879 
partly an illusion I think sports run
obviously<00:02:51.180> foster<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.139> image<00:02:52.409> that<00:02:52.530> nothing

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
obviously foster the image that nothing

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.860 
obviously foster the image that nothing
gets<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.190> them<00:02:53.370> that's<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.819> their<00:02:54.030> defense

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
gets to them that's one of their defense

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.539 
gets to them that's one of their defense
mechanisms<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.889> deep<00:02:56.040> down<00:02:56.069> he<00:02:56.400> will

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
mechanisms but I think deep down he will

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.460 
mechanisms but I think deep down he will
be<00:02:56.670> very<00:02:56.819> emotional<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.659> if<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.049> look<00:02:58.200> at<00:02:58.319> how

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
be very emotional and if you look at how

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.199 
be very emotional and if you look at how
far<00:02:58.709> Indian<00:02:59.129> cricket<00:02:59.489> has<00:02:59.609> come<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.000> isn't

they won it in 1983 but then they were

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.379
