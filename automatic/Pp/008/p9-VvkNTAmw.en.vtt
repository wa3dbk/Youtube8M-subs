00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
chart thanks to the work we did on the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
chart thanks to the work we did on the
horns<00:00:08.640> and<00:00:08.760> bass<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.300> lot<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> heavy

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
horns and bass a lot of the heavy

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.669 
horns and bass a lot of the heavy
lifting<00:00:10.799> is<00:00:10.889> already<00:00:11.250> done<00:00:11.599> nevertheless

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
lifting is already done nevertheless

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.470 
lifting is already done nevertheless
this<00:00:13.679> last<00:00:13.980> instrument<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.790> still<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.209> a<00:00:15.240> lot

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
this last instrument will still be a lot

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.400 
this last instrument will still be a lot
of<00:00:15.539> work<00:00:15.839> as<00:00:16.110> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:17.280> on<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.430> hard<00:00:17.730> copy

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
of work as you can see on your hard copy

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.290 
of work as you can see on your hard copy
the<00:00:19.410> reason<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.250> while<00:00:20.849> we've<00:00:21.029> given

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the reason is that while we've given

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
the reason is that while we've given
almost<00:00:21.660> complete<00:00:22.109> freedom<00:00:22.349> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.679> bass<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
almost complete freedom to the bass and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.089 
almost complete freedom to the bass and
drums<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.300> mention<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> sax<00:00:24.900> solo<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
drums not to mention the sax solo the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
drums not to mention the sax solo the
piano<00:00:26.400> part<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.849> critical<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.359> shaping<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
piano part is critical in shaping the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
piano part is critical in shaping the
mood<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> character<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.009> piece<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
mood and character of the piece the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
mood and character of the piece the
pianist<00:00:30.929> would<00:00:31.080> probably<00:00:31.470> appreciate<00:00:31.740> as

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
pianist would probably appreciate as

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 
pianist would probably appreciate as
much<00:00:32.340> guidance<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.060> can<00:00:33.210> give<00:00:33.390> him<00:00:33.480> at

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
much guidance as we can give him at

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
much guidance as we can give him at
first<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> yet<00:00:34.830> evolved<00:00:35.340> their<00:00:35.460> approach

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
first and yet evolved their approach

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.150 
first and yet evolved their approach
through<00:00:36.030> time

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
through time

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
through time
therefore<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.760> piano<00:00:39.060> part<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.480> going<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:39.720> be

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
therefore the piano part is going to be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.510 
therefore the piano part is going to be
the<00:00:39.990> ultimate<00:00:40.140> test<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> everything<00:00:41.340> we've

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the ultimate test of everything we've

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.670 
the ultimate test of everything we've
learned<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.000> far<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.390> chart<00:00:42.660> input<00:00:43.050> plus

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
learned so far in chart input plus

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.400 
learned so far in chart input plus
another<00:00:44.010> couple<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.490> tricks<00:00:44.900> this<00:00:45.900> chart<00:00:46.260> will

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
another couple of tricks this chart will

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
another couple of tricks this chart will
contain<00:00:46.680> chord<00:00:47.040> symbols<00:00:47.430> slash<00:00:48.120> marks<00:00:48.540> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
contain chord symbols slash marks and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.230

the<00:00:56.880> composer<00:00:57.270> arranger<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> decide<00:00:58.560> what

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the composer arranger has to decide what

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040 
the composer arranger has to decide what
the<00:00:58.920> pianist<00:00:59.310> needs<00:00:59.580> and<00:00:59.880> how<00:01:00.420> best<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.810> give

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the pianist needs and how best to give

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.150 
the pianist needs and how best to give
it<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> him<00:01:01.410> while<00:01:01.560> keeping<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> overall

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it to him while keeping the overall

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.840 
it to him while keeping the overall
chart<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.880> simple<00:01:03.240> and<00:01:03.420> usable<00:01:03.810> as<00:01:03.930> possible

remember<00:01:05.850> while<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> pianist<00:01:07.109> can<00:01:07.259> probably

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
remember while the pianist can probably

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
remember while the pianist can probably
handle<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.189> sheets<00:01:08.549> than<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> bassist<00:01:09.329> or

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
handle more sheets than the bassist or

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.569 
handle more sheets than the bassist or
drummer<00:01:09.719> it's<00:01:10.560> still<00:01:10.829> best<00:01:11.039> to<00:01:11.189> keep<00:01:11.340> things

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
drummer it's still best to keep things

the dynamic part let's see how short we
can<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.579> my<00:01:23.579> call<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> piece<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
can get it my call on this piece is that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
can get it my call on this piece is that
I<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> pianist<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.219> see<00:01:26.399> most<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.789> what<00:01:26.909> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I want the pianist to see most of what I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.599 
I want the pianist to see most of what I
did<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.539> demo<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.109> yet<00:01:28.859> not<00:01:29.100> let<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.429> get

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
did in the demo and yet not let that get

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.209 
did in the demo and yet not let that get
in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:29.969> of<00:01:29.999> individual<00:01:30.659> initiative<00:01:31.219> so

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
in the way of individual initiative so

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.099 
in the way of individual initiative so
in<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.520> opening<00:01:32.880> section<00:01:33.179> I'm<00:01:33.719> going<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
in the opening section I'm going to

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.529 
in the opening section I'm going to
notate<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.859> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.069> chord<00:01:35.310> voicings<00:01:35.789> yet

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
notate a lot of the chord voicings yet

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.959 
notate a lot of the chord voicings yet
supplied<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> chord<00:01:37.469> symbols<00:01:37.859> so<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
supplied the chord symbols so that the

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.230 
supplied the chord symbols so that the
voicings<00:01:39.359> may<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.569> eventually<00:01:40.109> superseded

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
voicings may be eventually superseded

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.639 
voicings may be eventually superseded
there<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.749> many<00:01:42.869> different<00:01:43.289> ways<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
there are just so many different ways to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.010 
there are just so many different ways to
voice<00:01:43.859> these<00:01:44.069> complex<00:01:44.520> chords<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.149> different

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
voice these complex chords and different

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.809 
voice these complex chords and different
voicings<00:01:46.469> definitely<00:01:46.979> result<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.460> different

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
voicings definitely result in different

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.480 
voicings definitely result in different
energy<00:01:48.179> I<00:01:48.499> want<00:01:49.499> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.649> clear<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:50.219> start

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
energy I want to be clear from the start
