I hope that he does I really do i mean i
think<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.669> his<00:04:34.909> charisma<00:04:35.330> is<00:04:35.659> fine<00:04:36.020> as<00:04:36.319> far<00:04:36.499> as

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
think is his charisma is fine as far as

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.110 
think is his charisma is fine as far as
his<00:04:36.800> look<00:04:37.009> and<00:04:37.129> everything<00:04:37.430> else<00:04:37.580> like<00:04:37.699> that<00:04:37.759> i

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
his look and everything else like that i

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.610 
his look and everything else like that i
think<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.810> one<00:04:38.960> thing<00:04:38.990> that's<00:04:39.229> holding<00:04:39.409> him

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
think the one thing that's holding him

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.249 
think the one thing that's holding him
back<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:40.129> he<00:04:40.759> can't<00:04:41.090> vocally<00:04:41.930> connect

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
back is that he can't vocally connect

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.929 
back is that he can't vocally connect
with<00:04:42.409> the<00:04:42.499> fans<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.009> if<00:04:43.249> he<00:04:43.639> can<00:04:43.789> get<00:04:43.879> over

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
with the fans and if he can get over

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.459 
with the fans and if he can get over
that<00:04:44.180> hump<00:04:44.449> i<00:04:44.659> think<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.990> lot<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.139> people<00:04:45.229> will

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
that hump i think a lot of people will

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.350 
that hump i think a lot of people will
start<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.710> enjoy<00:04:45.889> him<00:04:46.159> again<00:04:46.310> regardless<00:04:47.060> of

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
start to enjoy him again regardless of

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.230 
start to enjoy him again regardless of
how<00:04:47.539> many<00:04:47.960> or<00:04:48.229> little<00:04:48.560> moves<00:04:48.770> he<00:04:49.039> has<00:04:49.279> you<00:04:50.090> know

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
how many or little moves he has you know

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.600 
how many or little moves he has you know
III<00:04:51.199> think<00:04:51.469> if<00:04:51.770> he<00:04:51.860> can<00:04:52.009> make<00:04:52.159> that<00:04:52.189> connection

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
III think if he can make that connection

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.309 
III think if he can make that connection
i<00:04:52.879> think<00:04:53.090> people<00:04:53.210> will<00:04:53.449> start<00:04:53.779> to<00:04:53.840> buy<00:04:54.080> back

opportunity<00:05:45.139> that<00:05:45.560> Daniel<00:05:46.039> Bryan<00:05:46.250> in<00:05:46.399> my

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
opportunity that Daniel Bryan in my

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.490 
opportunity that Daniel Bryan in my
opinion<00:05:46.819> succeeded<00:05:47.449> without<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.289> yes

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500
