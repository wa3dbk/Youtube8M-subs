thought<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:20.970> were<00:04:21.060> gonna<00:04:21.150> win<00:04:21.299> quite<00:04:21.480> company

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
if I'm being really honest to be honest

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.490 
if I'm being really honest to be honest
you<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:24.600> our<00:04:24.720> last<00:04:24.840> home<00:04:25.110> game<00:04:25.140> we

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
do it does that there's done it's been

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.760 
do it does that there's done it's been
nearly<00:04:43.310> 15<00:04:43.699> years<00:04:43.729> yeah<00:04:44.240> doesn't<00:04:45.050> lose<00:04:45.259> it<00:04:45.410> he

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
nearly 15 years yeah doesn't lose it he

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.409 
nearly 15 years yeah doesn't lose it he
is<00:04:45.919> still<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.400> think<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.940> single<00:04:47.240> most

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
is still I think the single most

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.969 
is still I think the single most
talismanic<00:04:47.930> playing<00:04:48.259> apprenticeship<00:04:48.710> maybe

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
talismanic playing apprenticeship maybe

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.680 
talismanic playing apprenticeship maybe
apart<00:04:49.520> from<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.910> man<00:04:50.060> personal<00:04:50.389> training

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
apart from the man personal training

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.610 
apart from the man personal training

a<00:05:12.229> bit<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.530> and<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:13.220> sort<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.460> shifted

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
a bit that and it sort of shifted

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.460 
a bit that and it sort of shifted
everything<00:05:14.240> from<00:05:14.389> about<00:05:14.599> sort<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.840> 15<00:05:15.199> minutes

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
everything from about sort of 15 minutes

or<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:16.340> 35th<00:05:17.210> minute<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.570> thought<00:05:17.750> everything

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
or the 35th minute I thought everything

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.210 
or the 35th minute I thought everything
played<00:05:18.259> very<00:05:18.470> well<00:05:18.650> but<00:05:18.800> they<00:05:18.919> could<00:05:19.099> really

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
played very well but they could really

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.490 
played very well but they could really
fashion<00:05:19.699> a<00:05:19.880> clear-cut<00:05:20.539> chance<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.349> skill

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
fashion a clear-cut chance and skill

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.529 
fashion a clear-cut chance and skill
today<00:05:21.889> was<00:05:22.190> really<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.729> mental<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.270> thought<00:05:23.419> he

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
today was really a mental I thought he

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.839 
today was really a mental I thought he
was<00:05:23.659> brilliant<00:05:23.810> me<00:05:24.650> in<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.770> first<00:05:25.009> half<00:05:25.250> when

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
was brilliant me in the first half when

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.040 
was brilliant me in the first half when
some<00:05:26.060> of<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.240> other<00:05:26.270> Liverpool<00:05:26.690> players<00:05:26.900> I

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
some of the other Liverpool players I

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.330 
some of the other Liverpool players I
Henderson<00:05:27.530> not<00:05:27.680> they<00:05:27.830> think<00:05:27.889> they've<00:05:28.220> been

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
Henderson not they think they've been

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.969 
Henderson not they think they've been
plenty<00:05:28.759> well<00:05:28.909> but<00:05:29.319> it's<00:05:30.319> just<00:05:30.380> lovely<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.800> see

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
plenty well but it's just lovely to see

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.170 
plenty well but it's just lovely to see
the<00:05:31.070> ball<00:05:31.250> go<00:05:31.280> into<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.699> back<00:05:31.820> of<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.030> neck

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
the ball go into the back of the neck

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.939 
the ball go into the back of the neck
because<00:05:32.300> we<00:05:32.449> do<00:05:32.599> create<00:05:32.960> quite<00:05:33.229> a<00:05:33.289> few<00:05:33.470> chances

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
because we do create quite a few chances

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.860 
because we do create quite a few chances
but<00:05:34.490> that<00:05:34.639> thing<00:05:34.820> is<00:05:34.940> that<00:05:34.970> I<00:05:35.360> think<00:05:35.419> that's

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
but that thing is that I think that's

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.659 
but that thing is that I think that's
your<00:05:36.020> problem

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
your problem

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.850 
your problem
