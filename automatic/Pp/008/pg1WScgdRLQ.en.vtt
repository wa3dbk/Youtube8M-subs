also got an octa-core Mali 450 GPU which

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.569 
also got an octa-core Mali 450 GPU which
makes<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.079> really<00:02:05.319> good<00:02:05.469> for<00:02:05.500> 4k<00:02:06.069> video<00:02:06.340> as

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
makes it really good for 4k video as

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.999 
makes it really good for 4k video as
well<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:06.939> games<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.140> flash<00:02:08.379> storage<00:02:08.830> it's

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
well as games for the flash storage it's

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.850 
well as games for the flash storage it's
got<00:02:09.160> 16<00:02:09.700> gigabytes<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.299> emmc<00:02:10.959> memory<00:02:11.680> which

means that the controller is integrated

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.690 
means that the controller is integrated
with<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.900> nan<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.130> memory<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.489> going<00:02:15.579> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
with the nan so the memory is going to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.940 
with the nan so the memory is going to
be<00:02:15.790> really<00:02:16.000> fast<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:17.110> could<00:02:17.319> be<00:02:17.470> part<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.769> why

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
be really fast this could be part of why

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.920 
be really fast this could be part of why
the<00:02:18.010> antutu<00:02:18.430> score<00:02:18.880> came<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.480> high

I<00:03:38.829> actually<00:03:39.250> prefer<00:03:39.579> this<00:03:40.030> compared<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.630> say

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
I actually prefer this compared to say

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.720 
I actually prefer this compared to say
the<00:03:41.079> Apple<00:03:41.410> TV<00:03:41.709> because<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.099> use<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> lot<00:03:42.400> of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the Apple TV because I use a lot of

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.000 
the Apple TV because I use a lot of
different<00:03:43.060> apps<00:03:43.440> another<00:03:44.440> cool<00:03:44.680> thing<00:03:44.709> on

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
different apps another cool thing on

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.979 
different apps another cool thing on
here<00:03:45.280> is<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> remote<00:03:45.640> has<00:03:46.030> voice<00:03:46.540> detects

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
here is the remote has voice detects

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.929 
here is the remote has voice detects
that<00:03:47.170> actually<00:03:47.620> works<00:03:47.829> pretty<00:03:47.950> well<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.760> need

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
that actually works pretty well you need

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.059 
that actually works pretty well you need
to<00:03:48.969> make<00:03:49.090> sure<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.420> speak<00:03:49.810> slowly<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.349> clearly

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
to make sure to speak slowly and clearly

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.559 
to make sure to speak slowly and clearly
if<00:03:51.189> you<00:03:51.310> do<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.609> it<00:03:51.760> will<00:03:51.819> work<00:03:51.999> pretty<00:03:52.359> good

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
if you do that it will work pretty good

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.630 
if you do that it will work pretty good
it<00:03:52.840> could<00:03:53.049> be<00:03:53.140> used<00:03:53.349> for<00:03:53.469> Skype<00:03:53.859> conversations

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
it could be used for Skype conversations

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.270 
it could be used for Skype conversations
or<00:03:54.849> Google<00:03:55.329> Hangouts<00:03:55.719> or<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.739> enter<00:03:57.040> long

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
or Google Hangouts or just to enter long

or Google Hangouts or just to enter long
strings<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.760> text<00:03:57.819> into<00:03:58.359> your<00:03:58.629> browser<00:03:58.840> here's

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
strings of text into your browser here's

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.679 
strings of text into your browser here's
an<00:03:59.530> example

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
an example

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.970 
an example
who<00:04:01.689> won<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.819> 2004<00:04:03.819> World<00:04:04.209> Series<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.930> Poker

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
who won the 2004 World Series of Poker

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.619 
who won the 2004 World Series of Poker
so<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.159> is<00:04:06.310> still<00:04:06.519> much<00:04:06.790> better<00:04:07.090> than<00:04:07.329> typing

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
so this is still much better than typing

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.610 
so this is still much better than typing
in<00:04:07.719> that<00:04:07.870> whole<00:04:08.049> sentence<00:04:08.409> with<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
in that whole sentence with the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.429 
in that whole sentence with the
on-screen<00:04:08.889> keyboard<00:04:09.250> Greg<00:04:09.879> Raymer<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:11.170> next

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
on-screen keyboard Greg Raymer so next

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.259 
on-screen keyboard Greg Raymer so next
up<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.799> installed<00:04:12.159> all<00:04:12.340> my<00:04:12.459> favorite<00:04:12.819> apps<00:04:13.000> like

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
up I installed all my favorite apps like

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.119 
up I installed all my favorite apps like
next<00:04:13.599> launcher<00:04:13.900> 3d<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.590> bunch<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.889> media

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
next launcher 3d and a bunch of media

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.620 
next launcher 3d and a bunch of media
playback<00:04:15.370> apps<00:04:15.819> just<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.269> see<00:04:16.449> how<00:04:16.570> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
playback apps just to see how the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.569 
playback apps just to see how the
performance<00:04:17.199> was<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.680> having<00:04:18.160> all<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.430> apps

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
performance was and having all the apps

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.830 
performance was and having all the apps
installed<00:04:18.759> really<00:04:19.299> didn't<00:04:19.539> change<00:04:19.570> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
installed really didn't change the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.360 
installed really didn't change the
performance<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.470> system<00:04:20.769> was<00:04:20.919> still<00:04:21.130> nice

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
performance the system was still nice

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.850 
performance the system was still nice
and<00:04:21.400> stable<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.210> actually<00:04:22.870> really<00:04:23.229> fast

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
and stable and actually really fast

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.520 
and stable and actually really fast
so<00:04:24.280> first<00:04:24.550> off<00:04:24.729> I<00:04:24.849> ran<00:04:25.090> cpu-z<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:26.259> that<00:04:26.349> just

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
so first off I ran cpu-z and that just

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
so first off I ran cpu-z and that just
gives<00:04:26.710> some<00:04:26.830> information<00:04:27.340> about<00:04:27.400> the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
gives some information about the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.219 
gives some information about the
processor<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.330> system<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.169> see

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
processor and the system and you can see

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.990 
processor and the system and you can see
the<00:04:29.590> processor<00:04:30.099> can<00:04:30.250> go<00:04:30.340> all<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.490> way<00:04:30.550> up<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.820> 2

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
the processor can go all the way up to 2

clock<00:04:33.820> speed<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.599> you<00:04:35.259> know<00:04:35.349> they<00:04:35.470> crank<00:04:35.740> up

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
clock speed and you know they crank up

not<00:04:39.039> being<00:04:39.190> used<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:40.330> I've<00:04:40.810> been<00:04:40.930> checking<00:04:41.139> on

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
not being used and I've been checking on

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:42.779 
not being used and I've been checking on
my<00:04:41.440> watt<00:04:41.590> meter<00:04:41.830> while<00:04:42.039> I'm<00:04:42.130> doing<00:04:42.460> all<00:04:42.580> this

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
my watt meter while I'm doing all this

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.210 
my watt meter while I'm doing all this
and<00:04:43.090> when<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.169> processor<00:04:44.620> is<00:04:44.680> busy<00:04:45.039> it's

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
and when it the processor is busy it's

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.680 
and when it the processor is busy it's
running<00:04:45.460> about<00:04:45.610> 5<00:04:45.820> watts<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.270> when<00:04:46.389> it's<00:04:46.509> not

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
running about 5 watts and when it's not

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.570 
running about 5 watts and when it's not
busy<00:04:46.990> it's<00:04:47.110> running<00:04:47.349> about<00:04:47.500> 2<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.860> 3<00:04:48.070> watts<00:04:48.250> and

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
busy it's running about 2 to 3 watts and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.089 
busy it's running about 2 to 3 watts and
when<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.509> box<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.810> on<00:04:49.930> standby<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:50.710> actually

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
when the box is on standby it's actually

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.550 
when the box is on standby it's actually
down<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.280> zero<00:04:51.669> watts<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.270> nice<00:04:52.990> power

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
down to zero watts so nice power

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.460 
down to zero watts so nice power
performance<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.490> so<00:04:55.389> next<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.810> ran<00:04:56.020> antutu

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
performance on this so next I ran antutu

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.529 
performance on this so next I ran antutu
and<00:04:56.889> this<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.580> latest<00:04:57.880> version<00:04:58.180> it

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
and this is the latest version it

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.839 
and this is the latest version it
actually<00:04:58.930> just<00:04:59.139> came<00:04:59.349> out<00:04:59.560> today<00:04:59.740> and<00:05:00.099> it

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
actually just came out today and it

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.080 
actually just came out today and it
scored<00:05:01.210> an<00:05:01.330> amazing<00:05:01.630> 38<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.800> 65<00:05:03.430> but<00:05:03.970> this

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
scored an amazing 38 for 65 but this

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.909 
scored an amazing 38 for 65 but this
number<00:05:04.389> is<00:05:04.449> actually<00:05:04.599> a<00:05:04.870> bit<00:05:05.110> high<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.800> I

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
number is actually a bit high and I

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.379 
number is actually a bit high and I
think<00:05:06.099> it's<00:05:06.220> because<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.639> is<00:05:06.699> a<00:05:06.849> new<00:05:07.120> version

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
think it's because this is a new version

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.560 
think it's because this is a new version
of<00:05:07.630> antutu<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.039> ran<00:05:09.250> antutu<00:05:09.610> last<00:05:10.060> week<00:05:10.360> on

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
of antutu but I ran antutu last week on

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.240 
of antutu but I ran antutu last week on
it<00:05:10.720> on<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> old<00:05:11.110> version<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.889> it<00:05:12.070> got<00:05:12.220> a

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
it on the old version and it got a

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.279

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
score I've ever seen at 30,000 just

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.140 
score I've ever seen at 30,000 just
awesome<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.500> one<00:05:30.370> more<00:05:30.520> thing<00:05:30.699> on<00:05:30.880> here<00:05:31.120> I

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
awesome and one more thing on here I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.490 
awesome and one more thing on here I
thought<00:05:31.300> was<00:05:31.449> kind<00:05:31.659> of<00:05:31.720> interesting

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
thought was kind of interesting

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.409 
thought was kind of interesting
I<00:05:32.530> thought<00:05:32.889> I<00:05:32.949> saw<00:05:33.159> a<00:05:33.190> super<00:05:33.639> user<00:05:33.789> window<00:05:34.240> pop

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
I thought I saw a super user window pop

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.719 
I thought I saw a super user window pop
up<00:05:34.449> so<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.960> ran<00:05:35.380> root<00:05:35.710> checker<00:05:35.949> on<00:05:36.130> here<00:05:36.639> and

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
up so I ran root checker on here and

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.899 
up so I ran root checker on here and
sure<00:05:37.300> enough<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.630> came<00:05:37.840> pre<00:05:38.229> rooted<00:05:38.620> with

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
sure enough it came pre rooted with

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.760 
sure enough it came pre rooted with
4.4.2<00:05:39.909> so<00:05:40.630> that's<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:41.050> nice<00:05:41.199> little<00:05:41.229> feature<00:05:41.650> to

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
4.4.2 so that's a nice little feature to

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.439 
4.4.2 so that's a nice little feature to
have<00:05:42.070> if<00:05:42.370> you<00:05:42.520> want<00:05:42.669> to<00:05:42.729> run<00:05:42.880> apps<00:05:43.180> that

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
have if you want to run apps that

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.270 
have if you want to run apps that
require<00:05:43.570> root<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:44.830> won't<00:05:44.979> have<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.159> go

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
require root and you won't have to go

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.560 
require root and you won't have to go
through<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.580> trouble<00:05:45.909> of<00:05:45.969> rooting<00:05:46.300> it<00:05:46.419> or

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
through the trouble of rooting it or

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.200 
through the trouble of rooting it or
installing<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:47.020> custom<00:05:47.169> ROM<00:05:47.469> yourself<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:49.030> next

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
installing a custom ROM yourself so next

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.330 
installing a custom ROM yourself so next
I<00:05:49.360> did<00:05:49.509> a<00:05:49.539> quick<00:05:49.750> video<00:05:50.229> test<00:05:50.560> on<00:05:50.770> here<00:05:51.070> just<00:05:51.219> to

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
I did a quick video test on here just to

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.249 
I did a quick video test on here just to
show<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:51.610> how<00:05:51.849> well<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.180> works<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.750> all<00:05:53.139> these

Amma logic devices are actually really

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.270 
Amma logic devices are actually really
solid<00:05:55.389> but<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:55.990> is<00:05:56.169> actually<00:05:56.320> 60<00:05:56.949> frames<00:05:57.219> per

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280

nice and smooth it's playing on 1080p

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.430 
nice and smooth it's playing on 1080p
but<00:06:09.310> it<00:06:09.670> can<00:06:09.880> handle<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.210> 4k<00:06:10.630> files<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.350> I<00:06:11.410> can
