00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.589
 4 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.719
 the host country 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 6 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
 he can you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.670
 this is difficult, according to citi, in a quiet street in July 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.850
 desert 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 the inhabitants of the town are very quiet people 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.760
 they are sitting on a bench 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.380
 so is a good book 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.240
 legal or take a leisurely stroll to the utmost board 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.330
 can really relax and unwind 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
 the making themselves come in somewhere 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:23.849
 services that house yes 3 what a sick yes it adorns he is not going yet is a lot 

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.400
 or four b's 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.859
 even couples in love take it easy 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.470
 i'm hot in 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.740
 sisters arrive too fast 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 they were by far the quietest people 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870
 from the whole wild west around ten o'clock 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.420
 nevertheless it was an occasion where the residents were more bound to work quietly 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.600
 horse racing 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.700
 on Sunday afternoon a horse race was in town but of course everyone went 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.680
 entered the entire city was turned into a public grandstand the deposit finisthe 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 pulled in the typhoon that were full 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.980
 only the race could begin 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.180
 a bag 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 there were sunday evening 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.810
 appear at the start 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.899
 that is one of the largest 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 blessed is he 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.579
 spss 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.040
 was definitely something new 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.139
 other places 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
 to 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.939
 and like an exciting competition every Sunday afternoon 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.509
 hundreds of residents clearly have a preference for a park 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.549
 that is a good one in the orange park that just isn't his day 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 so that everyone was just as exciting again 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.099
 O 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.080
 but the mood kept getting grim lotus goes much better with the 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.579
 lunch break 2000s outside 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.019
 this happened at it 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.159
 if this is not the best yes 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.989
 with the utmost good he just does not go today 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.439
 because the supporters became a lot less friendly once the match 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.439
 started 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.039
 the second childish the winner 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.579
 no bad losers 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.430
 the inhabitants could no longer be enjoyed 9 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.589
 I think this is a nice color but yes 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.479
 and what's wrong with this tour 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.479
 How much 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.289
 medvedev that the supporters measures as a trainer 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.009
 Wilmerstraat could not do more normal than the game 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.979
 started 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.039
 but it has since been cleared 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
 look at the really this way 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.229
 what is it all but mainly 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.099
 no one was safe anymore 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.090
 bit for each 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.090
 green at this level 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.000
 we know 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.569
 that is actually all spacecraft arrows 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.389
 there were a few pounds awful on your de pee 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.249
 what do you want to know more 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.219
 sorry sorry brooks 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.249
 all trees fell 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.120
 we do that with green 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.120
 Christian light were renewed 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.520
 Hans near the town had turned into a war zone 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.140
 but who today 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.060
 it had to do but it can also be difficult 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.370
 there, by the way, he sat on the rock in the surf every time 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.639
 Iniquities He would have said from afar that a horse race had begun 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.639
 race the party most horses 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.900
 Jan Hommen CEO 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.319
 I don't like it 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.319
 the top club 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 that sportiness is hard to find 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.349
 Congratulations 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.379
 but really happy I am not we want to ride for the competition 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.449
 but they immediately turn it into a battlefield 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.089
 that is because no tournament has won 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.049
 Pinkpop can't do anything about that, I just don't have a slower option with one 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:52.229
 adapted driving technology, this problem can be solved quickly 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.830
 it's beautiful I've gel about that 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.069
 and so it turned out that the cobolli also made an excellent driving instructor 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.069
 what a siren 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.369
 the Middle Ages 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.199
 they both seemed gentlemen 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.460
 hold the concentration 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.379
 what oddly enough 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.449
 that was fun to do 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.979
 You have passed the horse dressage 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.099
 and so it was a completely different horse race that Sunday 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.669
 I started with Cruijff 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.159
 aoyama 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.439
 what is rss 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.909
 I have some nonsense 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.909
 raul bobadilla apple 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.869
 bubbles exactly at the same time 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:14.869
 the 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.539
 from that day on the supporters never have music together 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:27.559
 in fact they did everything together 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:29.259
 no of course not 

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.550
 for baked our century always a good cause 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:40.999
 bleacher 3 by 4 m over two years am so tired veenboer the nonsense that never again 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:42.389
 to serve someone 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.389
 take our losses this is done the city is saved 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:47.639
 and I have a long journey ahead of me
