might<00:01:29.940> have<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.390> teleport<00:01:30.869> away<00:01:31.050> I<00:01:31.409> think

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
might have been to teleport away I think

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.609 
might have been to teleport away I think
teleport<00:01:32.069> yes<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:32.490> obviously<00:01:33.470> caused<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
teleport yes which obviously caused it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.480 
teleport yes which obviously caused it
or<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.759> we've<00:01:35.850> seen<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.240> far<00:01:37.280> maybe<00:01:38.280> he

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
or not but we've seen so far maybe he

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.160 
or not but we've seen so far maybe he
needs<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> take<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.909> good<00:01:39.240> swig<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> redbull

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
