as<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> whole<00:00:50.280> bunch

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
as you can see I have a whole bunch

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.709 
as you can see I have a whole bunch
there<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.600> come<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.960> 25<00:00:52.379> boxes<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.719> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
there they come with 25 boxes and I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
there they come with 25 boxes and I
think<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.039> depending<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> size

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
think it's like depending on the size

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.250 
think it's like depending on the size
would<00:00:57.780> affect<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> cost<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.149> for<00:01:00.149> these<00:01:00.300> 25<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
would affect the cost but for these 25 I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
would affect the cost but for these 25 I
paid<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.910> 26<00:01:03.480> bucks<00:01:03.750> shipped<00:01:04.670> the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.790 
10 inches and then the height of the box
is<00:02:16.440> um<00:02:17.880> 6<00:02:18.880> inches<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:20.140> guys<00:02:20.320> can<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.680> of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
is um 6 inches so you guys can kind of

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.590 
is um 6 inches so you guys can kind of
base<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.130> off<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:22.090> could<00:02:22.240> probably<00:02:22.390> get

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
base it off that you could probably get

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.450 
base it off that you could probably get
away<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:22.840> something<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.070> less<00:02:24.190> than

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
away with something a little less than

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.850 
away with something a little less than
16<00:02:24.910> lengths<00:02:25.150> but<00:02:25.900> that's<00:02:26.170> just<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> went

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
16 lengths but that's just what I went

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.950 
16 lengths but that's just what I went
with<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.580> could<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.420> fit<00:02:28.600> LeBron

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
with just so it could kind of fit LeBron

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.530 
with just so it could kind of fit LeBron
boxes<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.280> your<00:02:30.490> standard<00:02:31.090> new

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
boxes so this is your standard new

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.590 
boxes so this is your standard new
bounce<00:02:31.780> box<00:02:32.310> everything's<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.550> be<00:02:33.640> like

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
bounce box everything's going to be like

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.940 
bounce box everything's going to be like
a<00:02:34.630> size<00:02:35.020> 10<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:35.920> 1/2<00:02:36.010> or<00:02:36.490> 11<00:02:37.030> fitting<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.200> you

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
a size 10 and 1/2 or 11 fitting so you

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.680 
a size 10 and 1/2 or 11 fitting so you
guys<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.370> base<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.730> off<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.090> or<00:02:40.330> I'll<00:02:40.480> just

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
guys can base it off that or I'll just

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.230 
guys can base it off that or I'll just
get<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> ruler<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.740> measure<00:02:41.800> your<00:02:42.490> boxes<00:02:43.000> see

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
get a ruler and measure your boxes see

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.750 
get a ruler and measure your boxes see
so<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:45.340> something<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.640> go

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so you can kind of have something to go

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.060 
so you can kind of have something to go
off<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.270> go<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:47.020> maybe<00:02:47.560> one<00:02:47.860> or<00:02:48.040> two

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
off and then go like maybe one or two

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.890 
off and then go like maybe one or two
inches<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.790> little<00:02:49.120> bit<00:02:49.239> more<00:02:49.450> than<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
inches a little bit more than the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.320 
inches a little bit more than the
measurements<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.940> how<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.150> New

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330
