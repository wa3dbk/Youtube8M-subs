00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.730
 do not 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.170
 very good to all and welcome once 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.580
 more to a video of grand theft auto ' 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.380
 online in which I'm going to teach you and 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.270
 learn to get all the planes 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.920
 available they all have several 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.689
 locations and depending on your 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.430
 you can find it in one or the other 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.079
 first of all you must know that the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.239
 vehicles that you can get are the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.599
 titan malar and peru as well as 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.880
 also the pe 9 966 and unfortunately the 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.309
 rest or you have to buy it as the luxor 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.530
 the mammatus the samÃ¡n the cuban the duster 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.480
 possibly they can not be used as is 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.219
 the case of commercial aircraft for 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.019
 those that can be achieved I'm going 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.059
 to teach their locations and their 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.399
 requirements is also important that 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.929
 You know that you meet the requirements 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.640
 means that one hundred percent goes to 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.030
 be there the plane but you're going to have 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 more possibilities many more but it's not going 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.870
 to be one hundred percent always like this in 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.940
 first place we have the titan that is the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.370
 large military transport plane that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.559
 is based on 130 ago which can 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.780
 be found at the airport from the 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.550
 level 20 approximately we can 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.409
 find at the international airport 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.420
 of the saints and we will start 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.810
 Also found at airport 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 sandy source what I know 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.649
 the airport of trevor but only to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.850
 from level 30 from that 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.200
 level because we would see it more 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.930
 frequently I in fact since 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.759
 I reached level 30 I always see him in that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.320
 location also of course what 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.259
 we will find from any level 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.270
 in what is the military base but that's what 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.619
 sometimes exposes most of the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 Sometimes it's not going to be there, we're not going to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.649
 find that plane there I know if I 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.060
 you want to get in an easy way 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.369
 you have to have a pretty high level 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.530
 so if you want to raise the level quickly 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.270
 you have a video at your disposal in 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.220
 my channel in fact you do not have one you have 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.110
 several that you can access through the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.729
 link that appears on screen in second 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.009
 place we have both the malar and the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.170
 bellum which are two planes without any more 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.569
 spices planes one more than 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.360
 competition like the malar and another one 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.099
 on more than travel like it is to see one that 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 we can find both at the airport 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.509
 international of the saints as in the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740
 sandy airport are just that in the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.259
 airport is andy we're just going to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.450
 find up to level 30 that is from the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.700
 30 below we will find there the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.940
 30 up is going to be replaced by the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 titan as it is logical because it only goes to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.000
 appear one of the two will not come out 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.860
 never the two planes the time 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
 so if we want to get it in that 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730
 airport we are going to have to be less 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.230
 of level 30 from level 30 only 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.160
 the titan is going to go out there instead 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.350
 we can also find it in the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 airport at any level we're going to 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.860
 find in many locations of the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.980
 airport in fact it is likely that there 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.959
 several planes of these at once what 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.250
 yes it is true is that most of the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.170
 occasions will be the volume that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.080
 let's find in these places the malar is 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.310
 very rare spawn ea very rarely but 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 we should know that we can also 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.650
 finally buy the pe 996 leiser that 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.209
 it is the fighter the typical fighter we can 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.459
 find of course and how is it 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.350
 evident in the military base from 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.489
 any level just start if 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.470
 we go to the military base, we're going to 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.510
 find in six locations 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.760
 different within the military base that 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.530
 they can be ignored because nothing else 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.330
 to the military base we will see in some 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.400
 site let's see one of these fighters we 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.110
 let's see at a glance it 's very easy 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.180
 go start one of the two hangars 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.910
 from the side or those in the middle 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.380
 track are pretty pretty simple 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.300
 They also take off very quickly, which 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.070
 they are very easy to remember 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.780
 that both the luxor and the mammatus the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.160
 sama del kuban and the duster you can 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.620
 acquire by buying 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.270
 through travel.com elites through 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.220
 of your mobile enter your 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.470
 mobile you enter that address and you can 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.660
 buy are pretty high prices 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.550
 because they are airplanes, well, 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.990
 decent but for example the duster what 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.850
 you can find pretty cheap 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.190
 thank you very much for joining me in this 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.230
 new video once again I invite you to 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.690
 you add me to the play to play together 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.580
 my idea is Carlos 97 as well as remember you 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.710
 that you can follow on twitter in maquilas 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.370
 spain without a greeting and even the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.670
 next 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.670
 goodbye
