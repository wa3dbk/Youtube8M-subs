first time today although we've known it
probably<00:03:13.510> was<00:03:13.690> for<00:03:13.900> quite<00:03:14.080> some<00:03:14.350> time

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920

as<00:03:15.370> soon<00:03:15.640> as<00:03:15.790> certainties<00:03:16.330> are<00:03:16.510> available<00:03:17.380> you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
as soon as certainties are available you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.680 
as soon as certainties are available you
can<00:03:17.620> calculate<00:03:17.890> risks<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.060> risks<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.510> now

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
can calculate risks the risks have now

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
so it's a simple decision so basically

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.040 
so it's a simple decision so basically
it<00:03:24.160> wasn't<00:03:24.340> anything<00:03:24.880> really<00:03:25.270> new<00:03:25.480> since<00:03:25.959> a

so<00:05:05.350> there<00:05:05.530> could<00:05:05.710> be<00:05:05.770> no<00:05:06.070> pressure<00:05:06.340> from<00:05:06.639> the

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
so there could be no pressure from the

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.760 
so there could be no pressure from the
French<00:05:06.970> or<00:05:07.330> from<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.600> French<00:05:08.229> no<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:08.500> don't

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
French or from the French no I don't

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.640 
French or from the French no I don't
think<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:08.979> interestingly<00:05:09.789> enough<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:11.500> again

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
think so interestingly enough and again

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.260 
think so interestingly enough and again
this<00:05:11.949> is<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.130> piece<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.310> speculation<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.240> my

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
this is a piece of speculation on my

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.180 
this is a piece of speculation on my
part<00:05:13.479> but<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:13.990> think<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.770> French<00:05:14.919> were

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
part but I think that the French were

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.430 
part but I think that the French were
really<00:05:15.460> rather<00:05:15.639> glad<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.270> see<00:05:16.449> Concorde<00:05:17.050> still

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
really rather glad to see Concorde still

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.469 
really rather glad to see Concorde still
continuing<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.250> operate<00:05:18.400> even<00:05:18.910> if<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.270> felt

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
continuing to operate even if it felt

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.360 
continuing to operate even if it felt
awful<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:19.990> they<00:05:20.259> themselves<00:05:20.470> couldn't<00:05:21.190> I

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
awful that they themselves couldn't I

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.740 
awful that they themselves couldn't I
think<00:05:21.550> politically<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.419> would<00:05:22.509> have<00:05:22.660> been

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
think politically it would have been

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.469 
think politically it would have been
absolutely<00:05:23.139> impossible<00:05:23.949> for<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.490> French<00:05:24.729> to

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
absolutely impossible for the French to

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.420 
absolutely impossible for the French to
have<00:05:25.599> operated<00:05:26.110> Concorde<00:05:26.590> at<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:26.830> moment<00:05:27.220> and

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
have operated Concorde at the moment and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.100 
have operated Concorde at the moment and
so<00:05:27.759> soon<00:05:28.030> after<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.539> accident

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
so soon after the accident

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.760 
so soon after the accident
I<00:05:29.199> mean<00:05:29.979> politically<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:31.590> state-owned<00:05:32.590> company

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
I mean politically a state-owned company

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.249 
I mean politically a state-owned company
isn't<00:05:33.280> it<00:05:33.520> well<00:05:33.729> us<00:05:33.940> no<00:05:34.180> it<00:05:34.300> isn't<00:05:34.570> only<00:05:34.720> that<00:05:34.900> I

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
isn't it well us no it isn't only that I

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.740 
isn't it well us no it isn't only that I
mean<00:05:35.320> think<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.849> people<00:05:37.210> who<00:05:37.479> died<00:05:37.720> in

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
mean think of the people who died in

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.400 
mean think of the people who died in
this<00:05:38.259> were<00:05:38.560> Germans<00:05:39.419> Germany<00:05:40.419> is<00:05:40.570> absolutely

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
this were Germans Germany is absolutely

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.290 
this were Germans Germany is absolutely
horrified<00:05:41.949> by<00:05:42.190> this<00:05:42.250> tragedy<00:05:42.820> there<00:05:43.090> if<00:05:43.210> they

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
horrified by this tragedy there if they

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.170 
horrified by this tragedy there if they
admire<00:05:43.570> Concorde<00:05:44.199> but<00:05:44.440> but<00:05:45.039> you<00:05:45.400> know<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.940> think

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
admire Concorde but but you know I think

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.850 
admire Concorde but but you know I think
it<00:05:46.270> would<00:05:46.419> would<00:05:46.690> seem<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.169> travesty<00:05:47.830> for

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
it would would seem like a travesty for

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.040 
it would would seem like a travesty for
Air<00:05:48.250> France<00:05:48.280> to<00:05:48.729> have<00:05:48.820> resumed<00:05:49.180> I<00:05:49.389> don't<00:05:49.840> think

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
Air France to have resumed I don't think

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.839 
Air France to have resumed I don't think
they<00:05:50.139> could<00:05:50.410> have<00:05:50.530> done<00:05:50.560> until<00:05:50.949> things<00:05:51.699> were

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
they could have done until things were

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.510 
they could have done until things were
more<00:05:52.120> certain<00:05:52.570> now<00:05:53.139> things<00:05:53.470> are<00:05:53.770> more<00:05:54.009> certain

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
more certain now things are more certain

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.149 
more certain now things are more certain
so<00:05:55.330> far<00:05:55.599> from<00:05:55.840> getting<00:05:56.020> Air<00:05:56.320> France<00:05:56.620> back<00:05:56.889> into

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
so far from getting Air France back into

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.070 
so far from getting Air France back into
the<00:05:57.250> air<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.610> has<00:05:57.880> now<00:05:58.090> made<00:05:58.360> things<00:05:58.659> certain

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
the air it has now made things certain

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.990 
the air it has now made things certain
enough<00:05:59.349> that<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.889> risks<00:06:00.190> are<00:06:00.310> too<00:06:00.460> high<00:06:00.760> and

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
enough that the risks are too high and

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.969 
enough that the risks are too high and
therefore<00:06:01.539> Concorde<00:06:02.199> has<00:06:02.409> been<00:06:02.620> grounded

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
therefore Concorde has been grounded

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.500 
therefore Concorde has been grounded

conference<00:06:09.370> tomorrow<00:06:09.610> is<00:06:09.849> it<00:06:09.940> all<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.240> it

conference tomorrow is it all that it
has<00:06:10.449> to<00:06:10.570> happen<00:06:10.690> like<00:06:11.020> this<00:06:11.260> that<00:06:11.530> even

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
has to happen like this that even

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.960 
has to happen like this that even
perhaps<00:06:11.830> British<00:06:12.190> Airways<00:06:12.370> don't

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
perhaps British Airways don't

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.100 
perhaps British Airways don't
necessarily<00:06:13.389> know<00:06:13.510> why<00:06:13.659> they're<00:06:13.840> grounded

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
necessarily know why they're grounded

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.689 
necessarily know why they're grounded
their<00:06:14.229> feet<00:06:14.380> as<00:06:14.770> I<00:06:14.919> understand<00:06:15.370> you<00:06:15.460> British

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
Airways do not know I think we heard the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.080 
Airways do not know I think we heard the
person<00:06:18.880> from<00:06:19.000> the<00:06:19.090> CIA<00:06:20.699> saying<00:06:21.699> that<00:06:21.909> he

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
person from the CIA saying that he

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.060 
person from the CIA saying that he
didn't<00:06:22.630> actually<00:06:22.870> know<00:06:23.320> yes<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:23.889> he<00:06:23.949> was

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
didn't actually know yes and he was

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.439 
didn't actually know yes and he was
going<00:06:24.190> to<00:06:24.250> be<00:06:24.340> told<00:06:24.490> tomorrow<00:06:24.820> it's<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.330> Air

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
pressure on who the AAI be have been

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.779 
pressure on who the AAI be have been
working<00:06:32.650> closely<00:06:32.680> with<00:06:33.159> their<00:06:33.520> French

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
working closely with their French

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.760 
working closely with their French
counterparts<00:06:33.849> and<00:06:34.659> they<00:06:35.080> are<00:06:35.229> technical

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
counterparts and they are technical

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.499 
counterparts and they are technical
experts<00:06:36.159> and<00:06:36.340> it<00:06:36.580> could<00:06:36.820> well<00:06:37.030> be<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.449> suppose

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
experts and it could well be I suppose

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.330 
experts and it could well be I suppose
again<00:06:38.050> the<00:06:38.349> speculation<00:06:38.919> at<00:06:39.009> Heathrow

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
again the speculation at Heathrow

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.189 
again the speculation at Heathrow
suggests<00:06:39.849> is<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.419> French<00:06:40.630> experts<00:06:41.080> have

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
suggests is that the French experts have
