00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
with these sets it's kind of a weird

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.580 
with these sets it's kind of a weird
verdict<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.170> not<00:02:40.320> really<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
verdict here because it's not really a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.350 
verdict here because it's not really a
sought-after<00:02:40.830> collector's<00:02:41.400> item<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.240> if

sought-after collector's item but if

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360

you're getting the wizard driver and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.860 
you're getting the wizard driver and
various<00:02:44.700> other<00:02:44.820> items<00:02:44.880> from<00:02:45.150> wizard<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.630> can't

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
see why not to get it just because

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.550 
see why not to get it just because
