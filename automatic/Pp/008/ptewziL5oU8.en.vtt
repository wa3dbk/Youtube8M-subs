00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.710
 and go on a journey that you don't often take 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 let's say you always copper your steps way 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.170

 and what are you not planted now we 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.069
 must be formed and you need x 3 because 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.799
 what you don't know can't say 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.450
 that will help you even if you are not looking 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 it is but how it will help you and you will 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.260
 to have some kind of gene and something I'm not yours 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.010
 help you understand something you didn't understand 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.519
 before that what happens in their lives is 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.910
 garden these very little things do 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.920
 the biggest difference therefore it costs 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.600
 him or generally if you don't want 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.400
 meet someone you know 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.500
 a long time ago call someone to and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.829
 long ago wanted to meet with 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.569
 by them 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.790
 open someone met a long time ago 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.980
 to some party but they 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.560
 you are not friends with them they are somehow you 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 you know we always wanted with them all 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.810
 because it doesn't look interesting 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.090
 your moment to call and talk because 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.780
 what can they give you children or 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.760
 help you as you think that what 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.130
 you have not thought before because what 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.440
 they say it change your me 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.269
 need something to dry very often 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.519
 so you want to talk to him and really 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.800
 you thought they were very interesting people yet 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.060
 one thing i think can match if you 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.430
 you are at some party and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.950
 praised anywhere that you find and with 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.350
 here try to meet friends 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.000
 someone new if myself but if you 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.910
 go yourself wire meet with 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 someone new and talk out with your 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.470
 friends to know and they are good at 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.690
 conversations and children will meet the wave 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.610
 sometimes it's nice to talk to 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.580
 someone that you don't know at all and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.920
 start to have some sort of 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.609
 relationship but some kind of relationship 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.860
 talk and something new what is life in 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.180
 not interested in this man the fact that 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.450
 can not say whether they like 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.920
 looked just feel something 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.490
 or see something that you don't always 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.230
 enter and i think what i want 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.750
 tell you all this video is just 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.970
 need to change your lifestyle but not all 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.190
 like party and change everything that you 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.010
 do all the time but if you feel 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.860
 what are you stuck you don't have all this 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.250
 inspirations need to change something in 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.770
 your life or in your relationships and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.900
 something else to do because sometimes 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.450
 these things are about yours because you have everything 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.760
 just very ordinary on 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.970
 and just everything is the same and there is nothing 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.560
 new what do you want by watching discoveries 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.270
 and nadya she was talking to someone that you 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.570
 maybe you would never say they 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.570
 there were such shlamazl and that would never 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.370
 talked to them 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.740
 that does not come to me can not be 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.169
 very interesting people and you will have 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.330
 some lovely 9 fresh if you 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.240
 can make it go find a new one 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.090
 music it can be pieces she just 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.610
 sat youtube and play different songs 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.250
 let's say you pour out how I love baths 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.950
 head and write on youtube and and one 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.030
 family of songs but aside you see full 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.760
 other artists 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.240
 click on them listen to them sometimes not 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.759
 may be 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.069
 just from the arena and therefore not two days 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.250
 keep up with what you know all the time 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.110
 change music music helps a lot 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.930
 that you are listening to something and you feel a 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.380
 I want to do so much now this 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.509
 music you need to find good music that you 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.599
 like new you didn't listen to the radio and 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.389
 listen to her less want something 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.210
 make even lie on the bed and listen 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:19.569
 music and without doing anything you can 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.949
 bring ideas yearlings work on when 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:27.699
 survive or how to get out of power 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:30.520
 well so all these were my ideas light and and 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:34.479
 Things I know I personally tried to do 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.030
 at some point and you're not all the time 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:41.590
 it works but of course my ideas are not 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.960
 for everyone and if I say it at all 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.419
 smarter interests you and you do not think that 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.819
 well, you just write like that 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.430
 what do you think can help someone 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.849
 find them not inspiration or be you 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.070
 inspired by something because if you 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.159
 immediately littering you can't 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.789
 nothing to do we are not mitnik emotion you are not 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:06.009
 a cooper of something so i feel so i 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.990
 were my moments where that i 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.659
 feel just lost but because u 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.449
 I have no air is not something new 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:16.360
 what I want to just specifically do or 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:19.750
 I see what I want to do 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:25.000
 so I think inspiration is this 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:28.180
 the beginning of everything personally, I see it like this 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.659
 all this chairs tell you today 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.659
 I hope that I said this will help you 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.969
 and if you were interested I jump a little bit 

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.110
 and snakes clothes at the moment I tell you 

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:40.599

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.539
 interested and here she is seen nothing 

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:46.090
 so there is not a lot of clothes because I 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.969
 I just want somebody everywhere if 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:52.750
 are you interested in this if yes I am of course 

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:54.009
 I will add more and so everything will be something 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.879
