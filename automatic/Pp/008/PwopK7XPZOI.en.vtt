00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
saber-tooth but really what we're

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.939 
saber-tooth but really what we're
looking<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:15.120> maybe<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> Kali<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.800> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
here than I just because this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
here than I just because this
concentration<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.960> caught<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.280> one

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
concentration was caught on that one

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:30.609

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so just kind of some things to think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310 
so just kind of some things to think
about<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> knife<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:36.320> restricted

so<00:02:02.970> when<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.179> comes<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:06.110> he<00:02:07.110> comes<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.619> slices

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.370 

he<00:02:12.690> comes<00:02:12.930> head<00:02:13.670> many<00:02:14.670> things<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:16.110> try

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
he comes head many things that just try

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.520 
he comes head many things that just try
not<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.980> cut<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:18.269> that's<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> main<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.380> mean

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
not to be cut as that's the main I mean

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620 
not to be cut as that's the main I mean
that's<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.340> main<00:02:20.519> arteries<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's in the main arteries that's the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.120 
that's in the main arteries that's the
goal<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.019> it<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.440> we'll<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.709> kind<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> play<00:02:23.099> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
goal of it so we'll just kind of play a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:33.530 
goal of it so we'll just kind of play a
little<00:02:23.340> bit

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:46.380
