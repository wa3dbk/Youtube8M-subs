sources you add into these into your

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.679 
sources you add into these into your

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
phone the longer it takes it to search

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.959 
phone the longer it takes it to search
the<00:01:47.990> information<00:01:48.740> just<00:01:49.070> puts<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.520> just

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
the information just puts it just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.480 
the information just puts it just
creates<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.899> lot<00:01:51.110> more<00:01:51.320> information<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
creates a lot more information that the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.090 
creates a lot more information that the
phone<00:01:52.700> has<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:53.180> go<00:01:53.329> through<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.740> which<00:01:54.920> you'll

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
phone has to go through so which you'll

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.130 
phone has to go through so which you'll
keep<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.460> down<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.969> four<00:01:56.210> or<00:01:56.420> five<00:01:56.659> or<00:01:56.869> six

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
keep it down to the four or five or six

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.219 
keep it down to the four or five or six
best<00:01:57.700> sources<00:01:58.700> available<00:01:58.969> then<00:01:59.810> you'll<00:02:00.049> do<00:02:00.200> a

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
best sources available then you'll do a

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.050 
best sources available then you'll do a
lot<00:02:00.500> better<00:02:00.710> rather<00:02:01.159> than<00:02:01.340> trying<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.820> add

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
lot better rather than trying to add

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.050 
lot better rather than trying to add
every<00:02:02.539> source<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:03.109> find<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:04.460> first<00:02:04.789> one

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
every source you find the first one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.270 
every source you find the first one
you're<00:02:05.180> going<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.539> need<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.840> do<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.770> get<00:02:06.979> the
