00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.190
 Here I would like to show you a small picture today 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.180
 the fog but a process and make Mareike Arndt and that with her something 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.370
 then comes second-generation Albert Fetsch the iPod Touch the third 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.690
 Generation and the iPod Touch fourth generation and the wireless 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 run against Ghana percent supplements offer make numbers like 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 count from the processor 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.560
 the AMS selected the game Gangster Gangsterboss Plus almost 2 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.190
 on a freely chosen the iPod version on all four devices Mendig 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.229
 and we will start now 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.170
 OK 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.840
 and then there's the song Bohmann Dante Neuland must and 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.900
 Percent boxes will see dangerous difference extremes 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.150
 I have now finished as when starting and when the help worried 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.490
 and then it starts so then we start with the Sweetest and buy 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.490
 and Jesus 3 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.630
 then missing 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.160
 here are simple mistakes 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.160
 around the heritage the terrible strongs quite happily 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.760
 Investor for himself 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.920
 why the shop is not the only one on the third try 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.710
 all at the same time to buy a new player 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.720
 Something you see which devices are connecting in use 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.409
 to the 3 2 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.350
 1 place 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 OK 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.870
 alone at 8 percent understands the iPad is a legacy game with 12% going and 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.740
 their characters that strike goes 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.390
 the second division still at 18 25 24 16 16 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.190
 but somebody has a bit faster 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.250
 as the company is already almost done at 76 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.050
 percent 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.069
 and the iPad is ready and the fourth generation is fast at 72 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.170
 28 16 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.539
 76 and finish 76 20 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.020
 we clearly see no difference here 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.350
 So now that's the third generation ready 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 and Albert Scherr second generation still lagging behind with 24 percent 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.819
 28 in debates is just time you're done so it's one 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.499
 have a small impression 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.179
 how fast that works 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:31.129
 that is already possible extremists in Tyrol at 72 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.569
 allegedly all wrong already 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.559
 we are the iPod Touch third generation still hangs 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.009
 behind those of the fourth generation 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.109
 especially at 78 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.039
 and as now AtatÃ¼rk said second generation finished so possible 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.739
 extreme difference 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 and then 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.429
 then we make it little difference from Oliver Teutsch 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:59.330
 2 gg at the moment it's about a lot going on in the graphics 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.590
 so bring immense times the power is watching how different the force 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.979
 path 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.079
 to iPod Touch 4g to 3gs 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.430
 and you can do that when you're in 3d 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.530
 and here we see it holding my arm 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.689
 Who does not have such rough pixels here to race 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.309
 animated around then fall here 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.299
 the camera is done 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.469
 it's really saying the flashing is a bit too much overall that is 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.510
 At the same time, however, are expected that the fourth generation 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.919
 to take 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.809
 ten meters no pixels at all 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:32.809
 the 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.129
 the game is right 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.469
 the graphics are not off and the room and 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.359
 So men are also for the circles 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.629
 Of course, this would not be so perfect for them 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.749
 but you really do not recognize any single pixels from mom 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.090
 and that is crass so in contrast 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.909
 to third-generation iPod Touch here again 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.699
 and recognizes the individual pixels here 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.719
 in the fourth generation iPod Touch, there's nothing left 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.700
 So really blatant as the difference 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.209
 of these two devices is 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.969
 and behind that said this video had been there to watch Golfes and then until 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.969
 next time 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.910
 damned 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.180
 Tasci 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.550
 Today I know that I did not say so
