00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.600
 Hello, Sir, Welcome to the modest cuisine 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.320
 in this section we reach our beautiful Ardahan 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 and "Hünkar Soup" 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 But let's take a look at the list of materials before you want 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.960
 2 pieces of boiled chicken leg 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 1 piece of dry onion 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.680
 3 tablespoons flour 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.040
 1 tbsp butter 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.720
 3 tablespoons oil 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.360
 2 cups of milk 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.080
 6 cups of chicken broth 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.640
 1 teaspoon turmeric 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.280
 and enough salt 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.120
 For the above; 1 tbsp butter 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.480
 1 teaspoon of chili peppers 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.040
 and 1 tsp dry mint 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.560
 Yes, let's start by chopping our onion to the making of our soup soup. 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 We have 1 dry bulb 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.240
 Let's start by trying to chop the onion 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.920
 let's go to the fire to roast now 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.200
 first we put our pot on fire 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.040
 we are transferring our liquid oil to the pot 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.840
 and add the onion we cut 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.200
 we use butter instead of oil 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 and 3 tablespoons of roasted flour 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.960
 while the onion and flour are roasted separately 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960
 we need to use hot milk 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.600
 let's warm up here 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.200
 now we add the flour we roast on our onion 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 we are beautiful 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.560
 we will turn together for a while 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.160
 in the meantime, we divided the chicken we have scattered into small pieces. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 we've broken the bones ahead 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.520
 now we add our chicken 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.040
 for a while we roast with chicken 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.000
 our milk is warmed, our milk is pouring 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.120
 a description of this Ardahan to be forgotten 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.560
 now we add chicken water after weaning 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.440
 salt to the extent that we ... 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.600
 we're gonna go with the latest turmeric. 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.280
 boiled soup, we boiled for 5 minutes after boiling 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.640
 now we add our turmeric 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 important to give color, if you can't find it is not necessary 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.520
 for a few seconds 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.840
 now we can turn off the stove 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.360
 close the lid of the saucepan and take a little rest 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.840
 we also prepare the upper material in the meantime 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640
 you know we have butter 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.960
 add dry mint and flake pepper 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 you're a little girl 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.440
 let's meet now 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.200
 yes, let's serve the künkar soup now 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 rest for a few minutes 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.840
 nutritious and different flavor 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 hot Hot... 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.920
 Let's move the peppermint butter 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.560
 and let's eat well 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.480
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.840
 We reached out to our border city Ardahan 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.400
 and "Hünkar Soup" 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.440
 I would like you to try as soon as possible, remember us and Ardahan 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.280
 Goodbye sir ...
