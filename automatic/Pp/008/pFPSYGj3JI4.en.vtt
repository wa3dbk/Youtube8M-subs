00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.620 
sensor
so<00:00:22.369> just<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.730> when<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.939> replace<00:00:24.330> this

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so just because when I replace this

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.200 
so just because when I replace this
engine<00:00:25.910> from<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> 528<00:00:28.640> to<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.320> 320i<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
engine from the 528 to the 320i and the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:43.670 
engine from the 528 to the 320i and the
braking<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:35.000> oil<00:00:36.000> sensor<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:42.350> before<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.500> do

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
braking my oil sensor and before you do

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.150 
braking my oil sensor and before you do
this<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.219> sure<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.090> drain<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.160> oil

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this make sure you drain out the oil

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
this make sure you drain out the oil
from<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.399> motor<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:55.370> okay<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.090> drain<00:00:57.390> out

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
from your motor and okay you drain out

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.639 
from your motor and okay you drain out
the<00:00:57.539> oil<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> motor

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the oil from the motor

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.590 
the oil from the motor
you<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> whole<00:00:59.760> pan<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.539> on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you just get a whole pan down here on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.579 
you just get a whole pan down here on
the<00:01:00.660> floor<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.789> what<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.910> using<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.239> here

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
the floor and what I'm using right here

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
the floor and what I'm using right here
it's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.799> 10<00:01:05.070> millimeter<00:01:05.369> 10<00:01:06.030> millimeter<00:01:06.630> rep

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it's a 10 millimeter 10 millimeter rep

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's a 10 millimeter 10 millimeter rep
it<00:01:07.260> looks<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.790> make<00:01:11.790> sure<00:01:11.820> your

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it looks like it so make sure your

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.070 
it looks like it so make sure your
engines<00:01:12.750> cool<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.590> hot<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.540> there's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
engines cool not hot and it just there's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.929 
engines cool not hot and it just there's
just<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.439> bolts<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.390> for<00:01:21.390> those<00:01:21.509> thank<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:37.510 

now<00:01:26.409> sticking<00:01:27.409> them<00:01:27.649> all<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:37.009> reason<00:01:37.340> why<00:01:37.460> is

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
now sticking them all the reason why is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.740 
now sticking them all the reason why is
because<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.850> busted<00:01:38.329> these<00:01:38.479> wire<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.630> I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
because I busted these wire and I

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.039 
because I busted these wire and I
couldn't<00:01:42.049> connect<00:01:42.380> them<00:01:42.530> back<00:01:42.679> together<00:01:42.890> so

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:58.590 

the<00:01:51.009> sensor<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:55.210> happens<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:58.149> you<00:01:58.479> don't

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the sensor what happens if you don't

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.130 
the sensor what happens if you don't
drain<00:01:58.869> your<00:01:59.110> oil<00:01:59.320> or<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.719> going<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.960> drain

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
drain your oil or it's going to drain

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.020 
drain your oil or it's going to drain
oil<00:02:02.200> because<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:02.950> completely<00:02:03.429> drain<00:02:03.729> it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
oil because I completely drain it

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.509 
oil because I completely drain it
because<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.349> new<00:02:08.530> oil<00:02:08.769> pan<00:02:09.069> this<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.310> it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
because it's a new oil pan this is it

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.970 
because it's a new oil pan this is it
this<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.390> 528<00:02:10.569> oil<00:02:11.530> pan

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
this is the 528 oil pan

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.640 
this is the 528 oil pan
okay<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.549> 328i<00:02:13.480> oil<00:02:13.810> pan<00:02:13.989> does<00:02:14.200> not<00:02:14.379> have<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
okay the 328i oil pan does not have the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:36.940 
okay the 328i oil pan does not have the
sensor<00:02:15.040> thing<00:02:15.250> here

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.590 

connect<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.100> wire<00:02:38.310> later<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.940> all<00:02:39.330> we<00:02:39.510> have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
connect the wire later what all we have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.920 
connect the wire later what all we have
to<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:41.630> just<00:02:42.630> get<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.650> new<00:02:43.890> oil<00:02:44.220> sensor<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
to do just get the new oil sensor and

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.110 
to do just get the new oil sensor and
screw<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.650> back<00:02:46.800> on<00:02:48.020> get<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.200> three<00:02:49.440> 10<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
screw it back on get the three 10 the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:01.810 
screw it back on get the three 10 the
three<00:02:51.420> 10<00:02:51.840> millimeter<00:02:52.320> nuts<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.430> place<00:02:59.480> and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
three 10 millimeter nuts and place and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:14.430 
three 10 millimeter nuts and place and
pretty<00:03:02.820> much<00:03:04.370> that's<00:03:05.370> how<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.820> change

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.480 

and<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.630> was<00:03:17.080> called<00:03:17.470> an<00:03:17.620> engine<00:03:17.980> level

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
and and this was called an engine level

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.950 
and and this was called an engine level
sensor<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:22.770> thank<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.640> your<00:03:25.450> car<00:03:25.690> has

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
sensor so thank you here your car has

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.850 
sensor so thank you here your car has
oil<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:27.810> well<00:03:28.810> before<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.260> started<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
oil in it well before I started this

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.210 
oil in it well before I started this
engine<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.570> continue<00:03:31.570> ahead<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.960> make<00:03:32.110> sure

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:52.130 

there's<00:03:36.220> some<00:03:36.490> oil<00:03:36.670> level<00:03:37.210> sensors<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.870> place

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.440 

so<00:03:53.140> that's<00:03:53.650> how<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:53.950> replace<00:03:54.130> oil<00:03:54.550> on<00:03:55.120> level

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
so that's how you replace oil on level

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.690 
so that's how you replace oil on level
sensor<00:03:55.810> thanks<00:03:56.680> for<00:03:56.830> watching<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.460> I'll<00:03:57.580> be

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
sensor thanks for watching and I'll be

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.120 
sensor thanks for watching and I'll be
doing<00:03:57.940> more<00:03:58.060> videos
