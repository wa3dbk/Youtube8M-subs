00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.789 
good look for them um but I don't want
to<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:36.990> overboard<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.710> all

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
to see them go overboard so we all

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.620 
to see them go overboard so we all
remember<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> model<00:01:38.400> 1887<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.540> they

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
remember the model 1887 when they

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
remember the model 1887 when they
patched<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.229> model<00:01:40.530> 1887<00:01:41.100> s<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.400> went<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
patched the model 1887 s they went so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.179 
patched the model 1887 s they went so
overboard<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.990> made<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> gun<00:01:43.409> obsolete<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
overboard they made the gun obsolete I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
overboard they made the gun obsolete I
hope<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.700> doesn't<00:01:44.820> happen<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> fmg9<00:01:45.630> s

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
hope that doesn't happen with the fmg9 s

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.679 
hope that doesn't happen with the fmg9 s
there<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> good<00:01:46.829> gun<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there a good gun and I think that if

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.090 
there a good gun and I think that if
they're<00:01:48.840> balanced<00:01:49.259> correctly<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.950> be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
they're balanced correctly they can be

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300 
they're balanced correctly they can be
fair<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.390> still<00:01:51.720> powerful<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
fair but still powerful so so you know I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
fair but still powerful so so you know I
mean<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.540> job<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
mean if they do a good job with this I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
mean if they do a good job with this I
think<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:57.360> balance<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
think they can really really balance the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
think they can really really balance the
game<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.280> fun<00:01:59.579> and
