00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 moin moin totti is not here again 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.860
 live in color for it with the best I am 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 I hope I mess up whole is scored 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
 ever third start-up because I always 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.780
 It does not matter what's here now 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.369
 Search for gameplay and destroy 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.290
 the map preview I play with the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 We can do the crib and the rest ourselves 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.220
 there are still a few people left 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 clear and it works now 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.890
 so in the background and we do today 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 In the test I'll test you so times 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.200
 you in front of her with your girlfriend 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 go for a walk or just shopping 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.989
 Something absolutely does not matter in any case 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 it must be alive there yes and yours 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 girlfriend must be a fixed girlfriend 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.579
 so even a good known yes it is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.120
 does not matter 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.240
 In any case, the crashes and all 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.220
 get it with you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 so and now I'll ask you two times 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.560
 possibilities to react to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.830
 However, only one is right there looks 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 it nevertheless times who brought the whole table 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.920
 So possibility number one you help 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 your friend promptly asked if 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.180
 she has hurt himself, he offers her 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.610
 a break in that they can only times 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.530
 everything can sit down but not too much 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 so that they are not exactly the same 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.310
 task because there are others 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.470
 to offer people there 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.350
 that would be possible number one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.000
 possibility number two and now comes 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:50.820
 you call according to jacques tilly 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.290
 that was never in life when foul play, the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.829
 often happens more solar boat before 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.840
 laugh 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.240
 I did not call for it again 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.549
 very clear to say that was the a 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.409
 steadily but pretty is the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.390
 fortunately also added fun 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.299
 because we know the types already 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.340
 It's just that longer but it's honest 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:15.959
 that was still with gamepad 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.150
 Now everyone wanted something 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.220
 I will have said that and now I will 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.870
 do not blind to the bomb but let it 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.730
 they explode and with it we too 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.530
 we would have lost the round 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.389
 but nothing would be done then 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.030
 First , I was the last survivor 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.370
 from the team and secondly we have the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.959
 wumme of course well covered I have 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.419
 I looked at someone else somewhere 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.630
 but I could not kick it off 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.829
 was also on war and therefore wanted 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.889
 I do not have the opportunity here now 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.230
 that now will get the ms then 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.880
 because the system is just better 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.299
 the one round divorced lost 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.910
 his 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.549
 better now the ams use me ever 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.919
 also helps to win the next round 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.079
 the whole thing is here public yes that 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.489
 here is no cw where anyway graduation 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.169
 series are switched off 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.880
 Of course it would be a different matter 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.669
 have yet to see it been since times 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.940
 somehow surprisingly pure jumps and 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:11.430
 maybe all the opponents are taken away or 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.079
 unnoticed somehow the bomb too 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.870
 defuse it though I have in one 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.459
 real cw i can now contact 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.139
 do not remember a longer flight 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.220
 therefore, it is always in a good mood 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.370
 everything is a little bit taken care of 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.790
 tactical I wanted to have explained 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.130
 if anyone comes up with the idea 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.699
 and why is he running? 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.449
 not out 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.470
 the round lost the round again 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.790
 interested in searching and destroying 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.320
 maybe a little less than that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.650
 So in general, you win until you get the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.729
 has four points so that one comes to 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.850
 Last thing for me today 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:50.250
 wanted to have addressed keyword 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.019
 facebook I've won before so 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.299
 recently had two pages once 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.600
 the normal side and once this 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.239
 fanpage and the normal page had as 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.410
 the disadvantage that you only 5000 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.320
 can have friends 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.329
 on the fanpage is that you can 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.609
 together somehow possible 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.220
 absolutely not important 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:15.479
 and because it does not work anymore 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.160
 I have to be active on both sides 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.709
 just decided to do it 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.070
 to draw the line and say 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.170
 just do one of the two 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.390
 and I can certainly already indicated 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.270
 more useful is simply the fanpage because 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.010
 because the range is unlimited 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.260
 and no child again 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.820
 must exclude like that on the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.310
 normal side would have been from there 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.540
 on the normal side is soon ending 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.040
 has one or the other already 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.260
 I've got a lot there 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.420
 deleted and I'll go now too 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.010
 and after that we just look forward to it 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.690
 delete and then just enter 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.010
 pull circuit underlined and these are 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.970
 Of course, I will keep on raising people there 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.310
 the list I really have with those 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.550
 what to do that I really know 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.470
 be it by gambling a lot or out 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.480
 the real life and that will be natural 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.540
 because that's how people stay that way 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.320
 actually not only do I know 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.760
 do not know 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.550
 I will then gradually 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.800
 So I just want to mix it 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.800
 retrieve who continues to be informed 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.600
 will here via the channel course 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.320
 on it pictures and times the one or 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.060
 other anecdote or something our in 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.970
 the description is here on youtube 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.850
 the correct facebook page linked 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.330
 there simply click once on it a like 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.460
 set and everything is as usual for you 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.980
 and you 're the same gameplay 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.020
 We have finished the salad you can 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.120
 talking so much does not matter anyway 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.760
 talked enough again 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.540
 Yes, thank you for seeing and being 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.820
 I hope I could hear you 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.560
 to chat 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.150
 perhaps not evaluate forgot 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.830
 do not forget to comment 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.860
 facebook page here as I said 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:00.500
 Also do not forget and say otherwise 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.020
 I like it always a slice too 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.590
 good do not know so far 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:11.020
 of course, as always 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.020
 I hope we will meet again
