00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.580
 I come from a lot of people to do 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.559
 a video where air blue is rising and is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.540
 really very easy but you have to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 just be here as if it was a 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:22.320
 cake measure all the ingredients and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.130
 not to adjust contrary to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.240
 other sets 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.029
 you can add ingredients hard 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.460
 I'm up close to the rhymes and so 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's a little desert is a little talked about 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 but I start with that of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:46.950
 Braised fish cleans braised fish 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.820
 not so star the fish and be 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 generous with seasoning 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 I love my desires inside my 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 fish with seasoning because 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 it really gives a very smell 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.990
 pleasing to the punch after cooking and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 are here I season the fish 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.560
 24 have a pigeon because that's what it is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 I like to do 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.990
 but if you do not have 1.4 season 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.630
 at least four hours before putting 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.630
 Baked and after seasoning men 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.869
 put in the refrigerator and put in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.200
 oven for 30 minutes 1,450 had to do 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.939
 Am I 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.510
 and 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.670
 since I left I hurt 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.830
 as a part of me 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.520
 I will try to think that I can 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.520
 to live without you 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:48.510
 spilled in a big dish and added 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.819
 another d milito is really at this 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.860
 point you can put your hand in the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.959
 mix because it's not very hot 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.410
 so you can add the flour 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:04.100
 from the south 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.959
 the smile 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 pattern 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.640
 another month 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.640

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.340
 I do not 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.340
 two cents 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.380
 b 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.770

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.470
 you know that I can not say about you 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.940
 if you are not there 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.320
 the heat makes it possible to activate a love 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.730
 you man I so you have to watch from 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:09.430
 little bubbles are inside of 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:12.480
 your mix here I used here I 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.400
 used a steam engine and sums 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.650
 little silicone to cook my abs 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.980
 but you can use a 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.730
 couscoussiÃ¨re or just at a 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.860
 dust with a strainer and a 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.860
 saucepan such as you have some 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:36.430
 balance and makes you men 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.290
 could use the small mode in 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.170
 aluminum with a little room to 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.060
 inside you do not have any if I do not 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.400
 show you how it is done this is 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.950
 really cheap that said like he 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:57.550
 must gold in the oven or in an email 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:06:02.860
 sorry warm men water before 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:06.370
 put the steam board mix 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.170
 because if you put so you have to 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.210
 put water on the fire wait until 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.040
 boiled water before putting a 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.040
 dressing and the trees inside 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.450
 you can not just put water 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.330
 on the game and put it on with 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:25.390
 the brax mix inside you 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:31.000
 can be used to blame a word at 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:34.360
 six in barbarian and lower if my eye 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.830
 editions monhÃ©lios a braised fish 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.840
 fruit drinks to know that the harbor 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.660
 is cooked you take yourself a knife 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.760
 wet your media Monday if the household 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.980
 stick to the knife that means that this 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.600
 is not your costs if the mixture of 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.960
 socopa knife that means it's 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.320
 cooked 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.830
 I would say when you put the blu ray 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.060
 the first ten minutes 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.420
 do not remove the cover because you 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:05.120
 risk doing 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:10.480
 to heat check if the noise after if 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.480
 the voice and then after ten minutes
