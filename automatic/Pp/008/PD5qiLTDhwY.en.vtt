00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.940
 I'm on a diet and so 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.940
 with mineral water 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.610
 you know the drink of it I do not miss the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.830

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.860
 tell the truth but hey exactly 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.660
 when you are pregnant you know no 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.240
 He knows how to do times at the end of the day but 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.479
 does not have alcohol is a good option if 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.800
 you can not stand the gas and the craving 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.780
 take a beer with a format of one 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 server beer without alcohol is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.400
 great because it tastes identical 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.850
 Rodrigo wins him loves to do this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.590
 roasted meats and others at home and as 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.060
 He knows that I do not always buy 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 beer without alcohol this if I get to his 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.070

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.720
 he knows that I did not drink they made me some 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.640
 non-alcoholic beers for your klamath or 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.310
 hey hey he wears the flavor ones 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 flavor stone 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.489
 They are very useful because they have to prove 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.959
 and because it's a wonder I'm going to 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.290
 say why they have to try 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.290
 true 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.319
 nothing sticks to the recipe on 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.560
 today I was saying two tablespoons of 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.540
 olive oil here they are and here is 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.430
 the olive oil we did not touch it there was no 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.230
 need because because we are 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.750
 cooking with flay boston pans 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.269
 those that come look at you escape or up 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.580
 of almonds already golden are no longer valid 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.440
 true oil in a beauty to cook 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.060
 with the shuar you have the coat 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.530
 superconducting the material with which 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 they are manufactured technology 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.810
 non-stick flavors asleep is a 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.100
 wonder the truth they do not have anything left 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.530
 stuck and right now they will see it when 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.989
 finish emptying all the almonds 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.670
 remove the hard half nothing left him 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.760
 stuck to the pan and nothing stuck 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.640
 and organism because we are not going to 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.549
 use oil to really cook 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.099
 we do not need to reuse oils 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.890
 fats butters goodbye really to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.480
 god but nothing else oil no no no 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.940
 let's stop consuming oil but 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.580
 that now new interns is much more 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.980
 easy the superconducting layer makes 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.440
 it's hot 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.670

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.000
 bad old that you're going to save yourself a 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.880
 liberal in gas 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.140
 the time is good saving saving 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.890
 it's really about cleaning a pan 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:08.350
 when the doctor when the food 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.910

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.100
 leave the pan soaked overnight 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.990
 previous or whatever it is not because you can not 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.959
 occupy that pan for the next 24 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.380
