00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
little bit of duty which is what I've

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.100 
little bit of duty which is what I've
more<00:01:12.250> known<00:01:12.729> for<00:01:12.759> obviously<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.810> can<00:01:13.990> be

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
more known for obviously and it can be

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.719 
more known for obviously and it can be
used<00:01:14.259> as<00:01:14.410> an<00:01:14.590> alternative<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.280> alcohol<00:01:15.369> but

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
used as an alternative to alcohol but

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:16.950 
used as an alternative to alcohol but
you<00:01:16.060> know<00:01:16.149> again<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.630> psychology

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
you know again it's the psychology

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.690 
you know again it's the psychology
that's<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.009> main<00:01:18.190> point<00:01:18.460> I'm<00:01:18.640> trying

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
that's the the main point I'm trying

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.609 
that's the the main point I'm trying
hard<00:01:19.330> to<00:01:19.479> get<00:01:19.660> excited<00:01:19.990> over<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.380> bit<00:01:20.500> of

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
hard to get excited over a bit of

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.940 
hard to get excited over a bit of
cucumber<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:22.570> I'm<00:01:22.810> over<00:01:23.020> Jen<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.470> Tom<00:01:23.560> they

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
cucumber as I'm over Jen and Tom they

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.889 
cucumber as I'm over Jen and Tom they
say<00:01:24.100> why<00:01:24.250> don't<00:01:24.640> we<00:01:24.850> consume<00:01:25.270> enough<00:01:25.600> fruits

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
say why don't we consume enough fruits

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.080 
say why don't we consume enough fruits
and<00:01:26.020> vegetables<00:01:26.560> no<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.700> know<00:01:27.820> why<00:01:27.910> don't<00:01:27.970> we

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and vegetables no you know why don't we

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.700 
and vegetables no you know why don't we
eat<00:01:28.240> enough<00:01:28.509> we<00:01:28.750> don't<00:01:28.990> eat<00:01:29.170> enough<00:01:29.410> so<00:01:29.560> if<00:01:29.619> you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
eat enough we don't eat enough so if you

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.139 
eat enough we don't eat enough so if you
can't<00:01:29.950> eat<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.190> drink<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:30.819> this<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
can't eat it drink it and this is the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.150 
can't eat it drink it and this is the
way<00:01:31.300> forward<00:01:31.539> just<00:01:31.750> as<00:01:31.899> a<00:01:32.229> juicing<00:01:32.679> radically

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
way forward just as a juicing radically

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.070 
way forward just as a juicing radically
changed<00:01:33.429> my<00:01:33.520> life<00:01:33.640> often<00:01:33.850> better<00:01:34.179> because

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
changed my life often better because

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.469 
changed my life often better because
often<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.679> nutrients<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.340> absorbed<00:01:36.479> much

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
often the nutrients are absorbed much

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.270 
often the nutrients are absorbed much
easier<00:01:38.050> you<00:01:38.229> want<00:01:38.440> big<00:01:38.590> juice<00:01:38.770> extractor

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
easier you want big juice extractor

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.160 
easier you want big juice extractor
anyway<00:01:39.580> Ellen<00:01:39.819> this<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.479> your<00:01:40.690> throat<00:01:40.959> they're
