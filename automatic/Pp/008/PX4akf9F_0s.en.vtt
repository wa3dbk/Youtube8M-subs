00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
pre-show and these two matches I grouped

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
pre-show and these two matches I grouped
together<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.320> they<00:00:13.980> were<00:00:14.040> both<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.969> uphill

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
together as they were both in an uphill

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.609 
together as they were both in an uphill
battle<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.690> they<00:00:15.900> couldn't<00:00:16.139> fight<00:00:16.320> against

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
battle that they couldn't fight against

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980 
battle that they couldn't fight against
this<00:00:16.949> spot<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> card<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.240> awkward<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this spot on the card was awkward and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
this spot on the card was awkward and
there<00:00:19.770> wasn't<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.310> whole<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
there wasn't really a whole lot of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.330 
there wasn't really a whole lot of
energy<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> seemed<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.410> if<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.279> have

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
energy it seemed so if they would have

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.700 
energy it seemed so if they would have
been<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.519> earlier<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.990> pay-per-view<00:00:25.320> they

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
been on earlier in the pay-per-view they

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.519 
been on earlier in the pay-per-view they
might<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.310> tanked<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.449> much<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
might not have tanked as much but I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.009 
might not have tanked as much but I
don't<00:00:29.460> remember<00:00:29.670> crap<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.630> match<00:00:30.810> I

but Toyota so I think titus o'neil needs
him<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:45.930> than<00:01:46.079> he<00:01:46.229> needs<00:01:46.409> Titus<00:01:48.439> mmm-hmm

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
him more than he needs Titus mmm-hmm

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.160 
him more than he needs Titus mmm-hmm
what<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> match<00:01:51.170> Steven

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what do you think about the match Steven

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.310 
what do you think about the match Steven
it<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.159> very<00:01:53.340> lackluster<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it was very lackluster and I think it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.480 
it was very lackluster and I think it
was<00:01:55.439> more<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> prime<00:01:56.250> time

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
was more to do with the prime time

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
was more to do with the prime time
players<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.299> break<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:57.840> great

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
players I don't break them as great

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.139 
players I don't break them as great
entering<00:01:58.530> workers<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.159> opposed<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.759> someone

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
entering workers as opposed to someone

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.020 
entering workers as opposed to someone
like<00:02:00.329> Sara<00:02:00.840> Lynn<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.740> truth<00:02:02.100> glued<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
like Sara Lynn to in truth glued this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
like Sara Lynn to in truth glued this
match<00:02:03.810> together<00:02:04.229> from<00:02:04.439> falling<00:02:04.799> apart

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
match together from falling apart

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
match together from falling apart
totally<00:02:06.979> he's<00:02:07.979> always<00:02:08.160> been<00:02:08.369> impressive

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
totally he's always been impressive

I<00:02:12.440> think<00:02:12.950> Roman<00:02:13.670> reigns<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.840> not<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> bad<00:02:15.230> worker

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
I think Roman reigns is not a bad worker

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.320 
I think Roman reigns is not a bad worker
himself<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.220> mean<00:02:16.370> we've<00:02:16.640> had<00:02:16.910> these<00:02:17.030> first

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
himself I mean we've had these first

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
himself I mean we've had these first
would<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.260> his<00:02:18.350> first<00:02:18.560> singles<00:02:18.860> MEC<00:02:19.010> city

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
would that be his first singles MEC city

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.720 
would that be his first singles MEC city
had<00:02:19.340> recently<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.910> roll<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.720> Daniel<00:02:21.080> Bryan

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
had recently on roll with Daniel Bryan

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.180 
had recently on roll with Daniel Bryan
no<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.690> was<00:02:24.080> probably<00:02:24.260> first<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:24.860> me<00:02:25.070> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
no but it was probably first like me and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.190 
no but it was probably first like me and
events<00:02:25.490> buy<00:02:25.640> at<00:02:25.700> singles<00:02:26.090> match<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:27.080> he's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
events buy at singles match but he's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.750 
events buy at singles match but he's
proven<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.680> he<00:02:27.800> can<00:02:27.830> go<00:02:28.100> as<00:02:28.250> well<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.640> think

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
proven that he can go as well so I think

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.130 
proven that he can go as well so I think
a<00:02:28.940> lot<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.300> falls<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> prime<00:02:29.960> time

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
a lot of this falls on the prime time

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.840 
a lot of this falls on the prime time
players<00:02:30.200> personally<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:31.190> that's<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.670> my

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
players personally but that's just my

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.470 
players personally but that's just my
opinion<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.530> match<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.860> general<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:35.360> was

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
opinion the match in general it was

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
opinion the match in general it was
nothing<00:02:35.720> special<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:36.290> was<00:02:36.380> average<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.240> we<00:02:38.270> got

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
nothing special it was average so we got

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.760 
nothing special it was average so we got
one<00:02:38.570> person<00:02:38.780> saying<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.440> shield's

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770

do you want to do with it break the tie
also<00:02:47.870> part<00:02:48.110> time<00:02:48.260> players<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.710> well<00:02:49.960> because

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
also part time players as well because

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.620 
also part time players as well because
the<00:02:51.800> shield<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.880> times<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.270> said<00:02:53.450> they

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the shield that times like I said they

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.800 
the shield that times like I said they
could<00:02:53.780> pull<00:02:53.930> off<00:02:55.180> pretty<00:02:56.180> good<00:02:56.300> matches<00:02:56.780> for

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
could pull off pretty good matches for

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.800 
could pull off pretty good matches for
people<00:02:57.260> with<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.430> part-time<00:02:58.730> players<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.360> just

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
people with the part-time players I just

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.730 
people with the part-time players I just
think<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.140> was<00:03:00.290> kind<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:01.390> yeah<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:03.410> was<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.590> good

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
think it was kind of yeah it was a good

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.800 
think it was kind of yeah it was a good
standard<00:03:04.130> match<00:03:04.340> anyway<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.510> was<00:03:05.570> one<00:03:05.780> of

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
standard match anyway and it was one of

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.640 
standard match anyway and it was one of
those<00:03:05.900> things<00:03:06.110> where<00:03:07.150> again<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:09.290> got<00:03:09.410> want

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
those things where again I just got want

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.130 
those things where again I just got want
to<00:03:09.740> see<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:09.980> continue<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:10.970> after<00:03:11.720> reading<00:03:11.930> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
to see this continue but after reading a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.960 
to see this continue but after reading a
few<00:03:12.170> spoilers<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:12.890> don't<00:03:13.220> think<00:03:13.460> it's<00:03:13.610> going<00:03:13.940> to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
few spoilers I don't think it's going to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.920 
few spoilers I don't think it's going to
so<00:03:17.740> but<00:03:18.740> in<00:03:18.890> terms<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.430> teams<00:03:20.000> at<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> moment

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
so but in terms of teams at the moment

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.320 
so but in terms of teams at the moment
the<00:03:21.050> shield<00:03:21.320> needs<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.920> be<00:03:22.100> in<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.880> position

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
the shield needs to be in this position

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.370 
the shield needs to be in this position
because<00:03:23.480> they're<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.780> team<00:03:23.990> that<00:03:24.140> needs<00:03:24.320> to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
because they're the team that needs to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.130 
because they're the team that needs to
be<00:03:24.410> big<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:25.300> because<00:03:26.300> they're<00:03:26.630> aligned<00:03:26.930> with<00:03:27.110> a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
be big in because they're aligned with a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.850 
be big in because they're aligned with a
big<00:03:27.350> faction<00:03:28.690> they<00:03:29.690> will<00:03:29.900> probably<00:03:30.110> disband

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
big faction they will probably disband

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.470 
big faction they will probably disband
that<00:03:31.280> what<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.580> attack<00:03:32.000> team<00:03:32.210> itself

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that what the attack team itself

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.510 
that what the attack team itself
probably<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:33.050> span<00:03:33.290> as<00:03:33.560> soon<00:03:33.740> as<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
probably to span as soon as the the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.010 
probably to span as soon as the the
tiles<00:03:35.330> get<00:03:35.810> taken<00:03:36.200> off<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.770> team<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.480> there

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
tiles get taken off of the team so there

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.699 
tiles get taken off of the team so there
you<00:03:39.080> go

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.710
