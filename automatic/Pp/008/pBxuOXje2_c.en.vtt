people how to be lazy motherfuckers now
that<00:00:56.910> rant<00:00:57.210> aside<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:59.039> some

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that rant aside there are actually some

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
that rant aside there are actually some
people<00:00:59.340> who<00:00:59.579> train<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.329> hard<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.960> who

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
people who train pretty hard and who

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
people who train pretty hard and who
most<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> their<00:01:01.590> training<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.399> good

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
most of their training is pretty good

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
most of their training is pretty good
who<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.449> promoting<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> blood<00:01:04.350> flow

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
who are promoting the blood flow

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.820 
who are promoting the blood flow
restriction<00:01:05.100> training<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> they're<00:01:07.560> clearly

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
restriction training so they're clearly

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
restriction training so they're clearly
not<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> category<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.450> let's<00:01:09.630> talk<00:01:09.869> about

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
not in that category so let's talk about

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
not in that category so let's talk about
this<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> minute<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.880> blood<00:01:12.060> flow

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
this for a minute and the blood flow

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
this for a minute and the blood flow
restriction<00:01:12.780> training<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.799> on

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
restriction training is that you put on

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
restriction training is that you put on
your<00:01:13.979> extremities<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.670> obviously<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
your extremities because obviously you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
your extremities because obviously you
can't<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> tourniquet<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.350> pecs

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
can't put a tourniquet around your pecs

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.490 
can't put a tourniquet around your pecs
you<00:01:17.210> wrap<00:01:18.210> tourniquets<00:01:18.780> around<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.170> arms

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you wrap tourniquets around your arms

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.260 
you wrap tourniquets around your arms
and<00:01:19.650> ride<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.950> legs<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> really

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and ride your legs and you do a really

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
and ride your legs and you do a really
lightweight<00:01:21.619> for<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> set<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> restricted

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
lightweight for a set with a restricted

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
lightweight for a set with a restricted
blood<00:01:23.700> flow<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.360> there's<00:01:24.570> data<00:01:24.810> showing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
blood flow because there's data showing

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
blood flow because there's data showing
that<00:01:25.759> when<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.479> tourniquets

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that when you do this with tourniquets

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.469 
that when you do this with tourniquets
it<00:01:28.979> produces<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> lot<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> same

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it produces a lot of the same

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.899 
it produces a lot of the same
metabolites<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> same<00:01:31.680> metabolic<00:01:32.250> after

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
metabolites in the same metabolic after

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
metabolites in the same metabolic after
effects<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.479> lifting<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> heavier<00:01:34.590> weight

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
effects of lifting with a heavier weight

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
effects of lifting with a heavier weight
while<00:01:35.670> using<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.210> lightweight

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
while using a really lightweight

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
while using a really lightweight
sometimes<00:01:36.990> 20<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.439> 50<00:01:37.710> percent<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.070> your<00:01:38.189> max

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
sometimes 20 to 50 percent of your max

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.499 
sometimes 20 to 50 percent of your max
and<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.570> produce<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.900> exact<00:01:40.500> same

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
and it can produce the exact same

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
and it can produce the exact same
hypertrophy<00:01:42.509> results<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.140> theory<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> lifting

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
hypertrophy results in theory is lifting

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.749 
hypertrophy results in theory is lifting
with<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> heavier<00:01:45.149> weight<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.890> let's<00:01:47.250> get<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
with a heavier weight now let's get just

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.120 
with a heavier weight now let's get just
into<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> basic<00:01:48.930> logic<00:01:49.439> behind<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.979> now

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
into the basic logic behind this now

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.630 
into the basic logic behind this now
first<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.689> gets<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.229> same<00:01:52.640> results

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
first of all it gets the same results

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.770 
first of all it gets the same results

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
superior training method it's just

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.880 
superior training method it's just
saying<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.890> similar

potential hypertrophy with a lighter
weight<00:02:01.799> doing<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.869> go<00:02:04.079> by

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
weight doing this so you're gonna go by

weight doing this so you're gonna go by
tourniquets<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.130> through<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> effort<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
tourniquets go through the effort of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
tourniquets go through the effort of
wrapping<00:02:06.299> tourniquets<00:02:06.780> around<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.170> arms<00:02:07.409> of

so that you can get the same results now
on<00:02:15.090> top<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.380> lot<00:02:16.710> more<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
on top of that there's a lot more to

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.280 
on top of that there's a lot more to
training<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.820> development<00:02:18.510> than<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
training and development than just

improving<00:02:37.590> your<00:02:37.740> bone<00:02:37.980> density<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
improving your bone density and the

heavier weight does that you're not

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
heavier weight does that you're not
gonna<00:02:41.040> get<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.700> from<00:02:42.240> using<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.810> lighter

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
gonna get that from using the lighter

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.870 
gonna get that from using the lighter
weight<00:02:43.350> with<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:43.890> you're<00:02:44.040> losing<00:02:44.490> a<00:02:44.580> lot

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
of the benefits of training so it's not

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
probably safer to use then this blood

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.310 
probably safer to use then this blood
flow<00:03:47.190> restriction<00:03:47.760> training<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.900> using<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
flow restriction training so using that

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.410 
flow restriction training so using that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
same a chain of logic none of you guys

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.850 
same a chain of logic none of you guys
should<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.750> natural<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.320> your<00:03:52.470> natural

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860
