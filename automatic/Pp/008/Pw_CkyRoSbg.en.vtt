00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 by far it seems mirage from close up 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 it fits on the screen the world stretches the neck 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.660
 in front of the curve of the neighborhood, the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.150
 high already built by man 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.029
 We're going up there but before that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 brand new wonder and deserves to be 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 contemplated from the ground 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.029
 in concrete and steel inside the glass and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 aluminum on the outside and very bright 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.390
 in dubai the new year had a party again 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 on January 4 to the official number 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.300
 was the well-kept secret until the last 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.820
 second 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 828 meters compared to other building 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.580
 famous empire state in new york 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.860
 it would take two in Paris one in 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.100
 the other to reach the height of the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.350
 tower of dubai the tallest building in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.129
 brazil is a viewpoint of the valley in the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 SÃ£o Paulo the 170 meters a gu ge vai 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.190
 almost 5 million before one covers the language to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 people understand is big 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.510
 the couple of Brazilians have to do 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 gymnastics to fit the building in the photo 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 the greatness of man at the same time. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 time is small by size and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.299
 greatness of being able to be built 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.880
 Luis snows and Brazil talks is what God 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.130
 did in nature 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 of the sea water green and not here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.229
 here is what the human being can do 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 build and it is not that the burj dubai wins 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 it's our nature 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.999
 the corcovado hill is 710 meters with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 the statue of Christ reaches 748 or 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:49.439
 so the tower can be seen at 95 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.400
 kilometers away 167 floors 12 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.280
 thousand workers worked on the construction 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.740
 and many are still working 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.910
 taking care of details as the official name 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.980
 burj khalifa seeks to say tower in Arabic 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.680
 and khalifa is a tribute to the president 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.649
 of the Arab Emirates but everyone calls 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.770
 of burj dubai even the building will only be 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.410
 occupied in February after 5 years and 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.060
 means of works and now the time has come to 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.090
 know the result of all this 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.090
 job 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.810
 the queue is great even with tickets 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.540
 costing the equivalent of 200 reais 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.220
 and here is the gift shop of the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.780
 neighborhood of souvenirs is way to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.420
 say that even the miniature here is giant 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.330
 of the metals sector is only the first step 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.000
 souvenir photo for security we 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 for them goes straight to the files of the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.110
 building surveillance 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 here is a park climate of 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.500
 fun 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.080
 the boxed computer the burj dubai in 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.090
 landscape of cities around the world and 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.480
 Now we're going to travel in the elevators. 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.110
 world's fastest 40 miles per 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800
 hour 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.020
 Fred has 57 pure lifts like this 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.830
 on here 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.660
 The journey lasts 56 seconds, a cold one. 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.720
 on the belly 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:20.110
 we got the video I felt a little bit more 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.120
 the view must compensate now we come to 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.650
 highest observation platform of the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.730
 world and this is the neighborhood 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.680
 the surrounding buildings have 50 floors 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.860
 they look like toys 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.060
 from here you can see all the wonders 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.400
 from the emirate 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.570
 and it seems that the world marked meeting 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.930
 on this platform 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.450
 people of all cultures and Brazil 4 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.560
 on one side since there is one on the other side 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.610
 or close with an entire wooded area 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.650
 The observation point is not very beautiful. 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.880
 stands exactly on top and a little bit 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.280
 more than building up 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.030
 this is the look of the tip of the needle there 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.030
 on 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.000
 the wind here can reach 198 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.890
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.350
 the apartment owners are not so 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.750
 enthusiastic about visitors 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.600
 the crisis brought down the value of the work and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.430
 many have already suffered a loss but what 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.480
 is recorded in history is that dubai 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 arrived the highest first arrived in 20 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.260
 years the rate was a desert and today it's there 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.260
 Are you seeing a fantastic thing? 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.840
 when it darkens the tower surrounded by 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.810
 water dancers is the largest source of 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.350
 bad dance a climate of a thousand and one 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.930
 nights with an account of this oasis but not 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.380
 in the fantasy world or in the dreams of 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.250
 most powerful sultan there was a palace 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.250
 it's so big
