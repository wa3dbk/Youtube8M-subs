00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.140
 food today is making them this 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.110
 video I'm going to make some rich denied from 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.440
 Yucca this is called in my country it's called 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.289
 yucca I do not know if in all the places 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.600
 will call so this can be found in 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.380
 the party 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.480
 the Aztec where they sell meals from 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.779
 our countries there are also many 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.150
 walmart that sometimes also has it 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.000
 these are covered with candy 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.130
 piloncillo 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.130
 and we are going to need cream 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.310
 and we can also use cheese 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.180
 mozzarella but I do not have to show the 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.760
 right now I'm going to use this this is luca 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.450
 and nothing else that I already removed all 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.890
 the shell like that has to stay and let's go 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.890
 to need a grater 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.670
 I'm going to start rolling it for 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.670
 finish it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.010
 more or less like that it has to be staying 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.700
 because then we're going to put it in the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.700
 processor 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.910
 more or less like that it has to be left 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.190
 you can do more finite if you 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.190
 they want but well I 'm like that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.230
 doing is very careful at the time 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.600
 to be reading this because if it's a 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.600
 bit dangerous that can be cut 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.970
 A) Yes 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.350
 also the one that we're going to grate 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.350
 so we can exist here 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 in our countries we use this other 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.540
 kind of cheese but now who do we use 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.939
 here the text is west because I do not have 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.410
 from the other than it should be but if 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.410
 they are very good with this also 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.000
 I have this kind of but of 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.069
 processor I have another one more little ones 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.069
 let's wait and this will work 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.090
 try to use this but this as the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.980
 teeth are very small this is not me 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.980
 it worked then I'm going to have to use 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 this one that I 've always used nothing else 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.769
 that this is very tiny, that's why 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.769
 I wanted to use this 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.959
 to this I put a little milk 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 to make it easier to grind it 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.170
 here we already have all the yucca crushed this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.130
 it was what came out of everything that I 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.130
 king and this we are going to take a little salt 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.520
 very little because this is to escom and it 's 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.640
 what is made with sweet piloncillo and 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.780
 nothing has to be left of salty and 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.780
 let's go cream 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.350
 we are going to explain it well mix earth 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.730
 now what follows is to put them to sautÃ© 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.160
 it's here I have the pan and I put it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.300
 oil and let's hope that the oil 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.300
 be hot 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.460
 here we have them in oil, they are already 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.460
 suffering this we are going to prepare the honey 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.159
 here I already have the sweet of piloncillo yo 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.930
 I put 2 this depends on the amount 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.979
 that you want to use if you like 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.139
 thick or a little weird and I 'm going to 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.849
 put as much water remember that the sweet 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.849
 water is also made 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.740
 we are going to put cinnamon capita 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.120
 this is how they are already suffered 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.860
 the sweet has to look good thick 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.749
 as you can see here is honey from 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.439
 This piloncillo is already boiling if 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:40.439
 it has to be 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.339
 Now what follows is that many of the 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.069
 people what they do is that already when 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:54.729
 they have them over idos they put them in 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.379
 of the sweet of the piloncillo but this if 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.389
 leaves them a lot of time inside the 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.669
 piloncillo this what happens is that 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.039
 they make water 2 and they start making dough 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.270
 I do what I do and he took them for 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:12.410
 separate if you are ready to eat 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.410
 I put them in the bathrooms with honey 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.449
 here they are ready, they are ready 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:31.090
 to eat and well this is all I hope them
