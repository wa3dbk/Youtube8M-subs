00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
in if you choose to use a knot like a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.590 
in if you choose to use a knot like a
polymer<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:20.100> at<00:00:20.550> Riley<00:00:21.029> not<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.510> know

polymer or at Riley not you know

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.269 
polymer or at Riley not you know
something<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.080> takes<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.439> lot<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.619> tying<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
something that takes a lot of tying a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.820 
something that takes a lot of tying a
lot<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.580> cutting<00:00:23.990> I've<00:00:24.990> come<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
lot of cutting I've come up with kind of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.480 
lot of cutting I've come up with kind of
a<00:00:25.920> cross<00:00:26.189> between<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.420> trial<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.109> knot<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a cross between a trial a knot and a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.020 
a cross between a trial a knot and a
clinch<00:00:29.820> knot<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.399> guess<00:00:32.850> it's

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
clinch knot that actually I I guess it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.160 
clinch knot that actually I I guess it's
kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> getting<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> slang<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.050> thus

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
kind of getting the slang of thus

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650 
kind of getting the slang of thus
Carlini<00:00:34.680> knot<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.000> basically<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
Carlini knot but what this basically is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.970 
Carlini knot but what this basically is
is<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> found<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.710> one<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
is what I found to be one of the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.479 
is what I found to be one of the
quickest<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> most<00:00:38.640> efficient<00:00:39.469> not<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
quickest and most efficient not when it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
quickest and most efficient not when it
comes<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> super<00:00:42.090> life<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> basically

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
comes to super life and what I basically

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
comes to super life and what I basically
do<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.460> instance<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.940> fish<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> lot

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
do is here is an instance I fish a lot

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.170 
do is here is an instance I fish a lot
with<00:00:45.809> ten<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.260> spiderwire<00:00:46.770> stealth<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.430> eight

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with ten to spiderwire stealth or eight

with ten to spiderwire stealth or eight
three<00:00:48.450> fireline<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.200> whatever<00:00:49.440> super<00:00:49.860> line

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
three fireline but whatever super line

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
three fireline but whatever super line
you're<00:00:50.280> using<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.360> basically<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:52.079> through

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you're using you basically go through

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
you're using you basically go through
the<00:00:52.440> iater<00:00:52.770> jig<00:00:53.629> once<00:00:55.039> then<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.309> through

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the iater jig once then you go through

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.930 
the iater jig once then you go through
it<00:00:56.610> twice

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it twice

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
it twice
and<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> take<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.190> wrap<00:00:59.370> one

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and then you take it in your wrap one

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.289 
and then you take it in your wrap one
two<00:01:00.449> three<00:01:01.260> four<00:01:02.039> five<00:01:02.820> six<00:01:03.570> seven<00:01:04.290> eight

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
two three four five six seven eight

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.359 
two three four five six seven eight
times<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.890> through<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
times and then you go back through the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.020 
times and then you go back through the
hole<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:10.229> created<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.580> wrapping

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
hole that you created from wrapping

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.440 
hole that you created from wrapping
pinched<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> against<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> jig<00:01:13.590> head<00:01:14.299> pull<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
pinched it against the jig head pull the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
pinched it against the jig head pull the
super<00:01:15.750> line<00:01:15.930> tight<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> voila<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:17.640> done

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
super line tight and voila you're done

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
super line tight and voila you're done
you<00:01:18.600> got<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:19.049> itty-bitty<00:01:19.290> tag<00:01:19.710> line

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you got a little itty-bitty tag line

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
you got a little itty-bitty tag line
that<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.759> clip<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.420> she's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that you don't have to clip and she's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.140 
that you don't have to clip and she's
all<00:01:22.290> tied<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.740> ready<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:24.000> tie

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
all tied up and ready to go I could tie

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.370 
all tied up and ready to go I could tie
this<00:01:24.210> knot<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.780> three<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> four<00:01:25.320> times

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
this knot about three to four times

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740 
this knot about three to four times
faster<00:01:25.860> than<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.610> tie<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> Palomar<00:01:27.119> knot<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
faster than I can tie a Palomar knot and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
faster than I can tie a Palomar knot and
when<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.290> done<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.670> any

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
when I'm done I don't have to do any

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
when I'm done I don't have to do any
clipping<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.570> ready<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.049> rock<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.380> roll

clipping I'm ready to rock and roll

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
clipping I'm ready to rock and roll
the<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.250> like<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> best<00:01:32.610> about<00:01:32.939> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the thing I like the best about this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.819 
the thing I like the best about this
knot<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.049> why<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.409> times<00:01:34.650> you'll
