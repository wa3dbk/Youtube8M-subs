 flight instruction here on the river is a 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.590
 place other than anywhere in the 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.760
 world because we have the mountain to 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.459

 right here behind us is very good, right? 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.430
 generally people are more afraid of 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.470
 time to take off 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.870
 after the person takes his foot off the floor is 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.489
 that she feels the confidence of the equipment 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.870

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.870
