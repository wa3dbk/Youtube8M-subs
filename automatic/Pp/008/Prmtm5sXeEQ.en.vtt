00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.969
 good morning to spring holidays better 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.850
 and more interesting to grow flowers themselves 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.459
 for example bulbous which do not require 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.779
 special care completely unpretentious 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.380
 you just need to comply 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.570
 solar mode olive and temperature for 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.240
 getting a beautiful flower is necessary 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.800
 choose the right bulb she should 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
 be as large as possible 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.380
 no signs of mold and spore fungi for 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.840
 planting will not fit bulbs having 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.120
 unpleasant or sweet smell it 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.980
 signs of disease and after planting 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.290
 bulbs and most likely in a few 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.780
 weeks will rot in order to properly 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.030
 plant bulbs need to be understood 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.880
 how much bulb we will plant in one 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.550
 pot depends on the diameter of the pot 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.040
 on the average bulb pot diameter 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 should be 7 centimeters on pain 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.140
 large 10-12 when landing on the bottom of the pot 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.430
 need to place a small 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.410
 drainage amount 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.380
 as drainage we can use 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:12.219
 expanded clay we fall asleep a small layer of earth 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.149
 now place the bulbs but down slightly 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.329
 pressing down 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:19.859
 when planting we fall asleep with the remnants of the earth 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:23.579
 in this way not to completely close 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:26.679
 bulb your land very tight 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.700
 we press down after landing the groups need 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.740
 carefully shed 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.170
 but the strait should be done like this 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.840
 so that the water does not stagnate in 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.389
 pot for good germination onion 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
 there will be an optimum temperature of 10-15 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:42.039
 degrees and maximum lighting for 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.659
 sprouting at home and 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.010
 getting beautiful flowers 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.190
 well fit daffodils 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.950
 hyacinths and tulips germination 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.110
 bulbous can take a long time but 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.140
 no doubt it will be fascinating 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.330
 process and already in the early spring you 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.330
 get the result of blooming flowers
