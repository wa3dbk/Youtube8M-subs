00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.250
 rosetta had traveled in space for 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.250
 ten years towards a call comet 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.289
 67p churyumov gerasimenko the journey is 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.590
 been long and she falls into a sleep 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.150
 deep that lasted for two years 7 months e 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.060
 12 days 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.730
 but on January 20, 2014 with the help of 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.000
 everyone on earth shouted wake up 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.670
 rosetta she opened her eyes and did 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.550
 to know that everyone was fine there 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.920
 There were so many celebrations and the team 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.290
 of rosetta immediately got to work 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.720
 controlling his health after the long 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.480
 sleep there was still a long way to 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.390
 travel to reach the comet but 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.160
 rosette had a lot to do was not there 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.870
 time to waste 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.180
 all the experiments that have been 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.629
 installed on board veils be put on 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.940
 running together with lander files when 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.829
 they would arrive at the comet they would have 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.860
 discovered all about his 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.159
 surface and dust and gas around 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.470
 it and the scientists at home would have 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.900
 put all these pieces together as a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 puzzles to understand how they work 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.070
 comets in a short time 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.320
 rosetta was able to see the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.240
 comet in the distance approached 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.030
 more and more but there were still many 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.220
 challenges to face the path to the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.720
 comet was complicated and rosette has 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.909
 had to perform some maneuvers 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 difficult had to change her 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.420
 speed between 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.369
 speak to that of the comet otherwise 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.609
 would have flown over a wrong step 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.460
 and he could not make it there 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.009
 there were 10 maneuvers to be performed but rosette 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.840
 she was determined as she checked them 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.479
 all one by one 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.880
 the comet is getting closer and closer 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.149
 was the most wonderful show that 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.130
 rosette has ever seen but knew that 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.590
 once it arrived there would not have been 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.140
 time to rest 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.599
 rosette and file are in charge of 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.929
 do the most important work of the 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.929
 their life
