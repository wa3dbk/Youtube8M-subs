00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:25.320
 I think coffee thinks something 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.140
 It's the same thing the same as that. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 the activity director does the same thing 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:36.059
 because they make me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:44.399
 hi any difference of director design 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 of art that you what is your function 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.600
 here in the forum 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:05.309
 the service also guides the design in the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:07.409
 graphic design 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 much more with a form of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.060
 present the art director but the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.680
 impact of what is going to present a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 thing like that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.530
 the designer his butt but have serum 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.610
 so thicker but I like the target 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.610
 of art director 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:35.500
 the site does not speak in the boat the leader 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:36.580
 speech is that's it's design was the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:44.850
 olive trees 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.850
 the art director year in the top 100 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.750
 The problem is that I do what I do 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.790
 that defines me 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.510
 I have to look here from art that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.340
 person who will be commanding the whole 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.080
 really the person who is 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.530
 the caption participating the service 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.720
 within an agency or within a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.470
 design studio 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.260
 go that knowledge and domain 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.290
 about the techniques for which he can 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.420
 charge and require a level of work to be 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.130
 person from the beginning to the end of the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.260
 process containing a series of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.620
 people can be an advertiser like 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.540
 generally the same graphic design has 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.940
 really connect with the person who 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.070
 was putting his hand on the dough is 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.070
 day-to-day development of a role that 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.950
 is receiving a steak and you 're talking 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.239
 being coordinated by the art director 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.510
 an event in English which means 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.489
 project and always has a function with a 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.680
 form is a form that is in function of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.150
 class since it is necessary it must 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 will be used for the consumer 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.769
 Such specific public is at all 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.110
 is any dimensional creation that you 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.840
 can observe you have a design be 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.269
 that good or bad design the direction of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.250
 art she always worked with design 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.870
 and graphic design is part of the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.760
 day-to-day art director who are 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.980
 graphic design publishing campaigns 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.750
 electronic concepts that are 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.430
 created precisely in function and a 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.530
 advertising objective is to make 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.480
 public to promote and promote 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.510

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.870
 in advertising and advertising design 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.329
 it may or may not exercise the function 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.440
 master of art is therefore 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.180
 all aspects involving the creation of 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.470
 advertising its parts or 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.600
 art director he needs to master 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.880
 all aspects involving the creation of 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.709
 advertising the creation of pieces that 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.480
 Do you want to photograph you have to understand? 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.700
 demonstration of understanding of colors understand 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 of technology typography has to 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.109
 understanding is of audiovisual 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.540
 camera sesdec have to understand of 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.730
 audiovisual editing has to understand 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.440
 stage direction has to know how to make 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.480
 the script has to know how to read the script has 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.769
 that know how to direct script or 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.959
 art director he needs to understand 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.459
 everything that involves setting up agencies 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.090
 advertising 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.319
 Something else they keep asking me 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.239
 also the art director needs to 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.340
 understand programs need to know 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.420
 to draw or who knows how to 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.120
 art director he has to understand 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.620
 this does not necessarily mean 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.540
 technically for example the director of 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.330
 art has to understand what it wants and 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.459
 where he wants to get it is what kind of 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.720
 color type lighting is suitable 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.489
 for that audience for that effect 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.389
 that you want to go through with that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.060
 campaign 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.500
 he has to understand is what kind of source 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.850
 which is most appropriate to use for 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.410
 achieve campaign objectives 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.660
 remembering that the whole campaign 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.180
 has an objective of consumption 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.740
 the goal of selling when we are 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 talking about movies from any other area 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.830
 of the art director 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.540
 the goal is the same always pass a 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.280
 idea is to convey a sense of 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.310
 experience with the advertising 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 is creating and can not be confused 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.389
 program's with the director role 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.490
 with the function of design what the 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.169
 graphic design involves is fundamental 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.610
 to be a good art director 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.740
 so new today open that people 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.789
 finalize this debate on design and 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.750
 art direction 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.789
 we have here is the book of nilton caesar 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.100
 direction of art propaganda is right 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.060
 in this book is already in the eighth edition he 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.530
 it's a book that we thought 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.000
 professionals who are mainly 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.740
 beginning in the direction of art to 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.900
 understand this conceptual difference then 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.500
 the 15 commandments of the art director of 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.360
 fn art direction from here the director of 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.639
 art ready com.br 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.260
 and we have here in show design design 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.940
 art direction what is your role in the world 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.650
 understand a little more about advertising 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.150
 propaganda from the director's point of view 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.919
 of art and design 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.610
 I hope you had fun and 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.840
 Until another day, you get angry at the difference. 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.840
 says invention of art 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:46.300
 [Music] 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:51.539
 due to the difference of designers and 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:06:00.270
 theaters or even another in creating 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:06:00.270
 any branch
