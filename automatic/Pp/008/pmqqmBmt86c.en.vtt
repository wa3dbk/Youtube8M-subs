lock first today we're going to talk
about<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.910> two<00:00:47.090> inch<00:00:47.330> flexi<00:00:47.930> lap<00:00:48.110> belt<00:00:48.410> well

about the two inch flexi lap belt well

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.340 
about the two inch flexi lap belt well
currently<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:50.000> pulldown<00:00:50.420> configuration

currently and a pulldown configuration

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.050 
currently and a pulldown configuration
they<00:00:51.800> can<00:00:51.950> be<00:00:52.040> very<00:00:52.190> easily<00:00:52.430> changed<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
they can be very easily changed to a

they can be very easily changed to a
pull-up<00:00:53.650> first<00:00:54.650> we<00:00:55.460> actually<00:00:55.820> start<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.210> undo

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
pull-up first we actually start to undo

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.090 
pull-up first we actually start to undo
it<00:00:56.600> where<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:56.960> clip<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.380> cam<00:00:57.590> lock<00:00:57.830> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
it where we clip in the cam lock and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.690 
it where we clip in the cam lock and
it's<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:58.820> by<00:00:58.940> reversing<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.420> procedure<00:01:00.700> so

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's just by reversing the procedure so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.060 
it's just by reversing the procedure so
at<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:02.270> point<00:01:02.570> what<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.620> this<00:01:03.830> kind

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
at this point what you do is this kind

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.530 
at this point what you do is this kind
of<00:01:04.159> involves<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.610> little<00:01:04.729> bit<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:05.059> finger<00:01:05.420> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
of involves a little bit of a finger and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.999 
of involves a little bit of a finger and
a<00:01:06.200> push<00:01:06.439> with<00:01:06.590> your<00:01:06.619> thumb<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.299> you<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.509> see

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
a push with your thumb so as you can see

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.980 
a push with your thumb so as you can see
as<00:01:10.009> you're<00:01:10.939> pulling<00:01:11.210> with<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.330> finger<00:01:11.659> work

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
as you're pulling with the finger work

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.969 
as you're pulling with the finger work
the<00:01:12.290> webbing<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.799> with<00:01:13.189> your<00:01:13.340> thumb<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:15.710> slowly

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the webbing in with your thumb to slowly

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.609 
the webbing in with your thumb to slowly
release<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.820> webbing<00:01:17.509> at<00:01:17.689> sides<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.380> pull<00:01:18.560> at

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
release the webbing at sides you pull at

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.989 
release the webbing at sides you pull at
the<00:01:18.679> same<00:01:18.859> time<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.429> see<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.700> slide

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
the same time you can see it slide

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:24.370 
the same time you can see it slide
through<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.960> cam<00:01:21.200> lock<00:01:21.439> clip<00:01:22.899> at<00:01:23.899> this<00:01:24.109> point

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
through the cam lock clip at this point

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.440 
through the cam lock clip at this point
basically<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.399> wrap<00:01:25.549> will<00:01:25.729> fall<00:01:25.909> completely

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
basically the wrap will fall completely

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.980 
basically the wrap will fall completely
out<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:27.499> we<00:01:27.560> have<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.009> blank<00:01:28.399> belt<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.810> what

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
out and now we have a blank belt so what

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.999 
out and now we have a blank belt so what
we<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.439> switch<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.859> around<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:33.009> reverse

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
we do is switch it around and reverse

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.599 
we do is switch it around and reverse
procedure<00:01:34.310> first<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.359> take<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.659> lv4<00:01:36.460> slide<00:01:37.460> it

most common stall is a snap in where we
use<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> SG<00:02:34.600> 22<00:02:35.050> hardware<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.220> we'll<00:02:36.310> start

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
use the SG 22 hardware so we'll start

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.050 
use the SG 22 hardware so we'll start
with<00:02:36.700> that

of<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.489> angle<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.239> what's<00:03:58.450> nice<00:03:58.599> about<00:03:58.660> this

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
of the angle and what's nice about this

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.170 
of the angle and what's nice about this
piece<00:03:59.349> is<00:03:59.530> you<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.769> bend<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.129> 90<00:04:00.579> degrees<00:04:00.849> this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
piece is you can bend it 90 degrees this

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.970 
piece is you can bend it 90 degrees this
way<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.690> also<00:04:01.959> twist<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:02.530> 90<00:04:02.890> degrees

mounting<00:04:05.829> we<00:04:06.670> also<00:04:06.819> have<00:04:07.000> what's<00:04:07.120> called<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
mounting we also have what's called a

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.180 
mounting we also have what's called a
b24<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.530> for<00:04:08.709> bolt<00:04:09.010> and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
b24 and this is for bolt and

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:30.730 
b24 and this is for bolt and
applications<00:04:10.049> son<00:04:11.049> wrap<00:04:11.400> b14<00:04:12.400> real<00:04:12.760> quick

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.999 

and<00:04:31.740> just<00:04:32.340> as<00:04:32.460> we<00:04:32.610> did<00:04:32.639> with<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.300> b14<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.830> can

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
and just as we did with the b14 we can

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.610 
and just as we did with the b14 we can
do<00:04:35.099> just<00:04:35.340> with<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.550> b-24<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:36.990> we<00:04:37.080> take<00:04:37.289> it

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
do just with the b-24 so we take it

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.339 
do just with the b-24 so we take it
facing<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.610> angle<00:04:38.910> down<00:04:39.090> come<00:04:40.020> through<00:04:40.259> the
