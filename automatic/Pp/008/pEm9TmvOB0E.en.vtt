00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
sewing so we are going to make sure that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.450 
sewing so we are going to make sure that
the<00:00:16.770> needle<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.609> topmost<00:00:17.910> position

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
the needle is in the topmost position

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.670 
the needle is in the topmost position
yes<00:00:20.460> there<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> top<00:00:21.600> foots<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.500> so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
yes there it is then the top foots up so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
yes there it is then the top foots up so
I<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.890> put<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> paper<00:00:23.400> under<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.330> we're

I can put the paper under it and we're
putting<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.650> down<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.670> black<00:00:27.180> line<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
putting it down so that black line is

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
putting it down so that black line is
going<00:00:29.699> right<00:00:30.300> down<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.750> middle

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the stitches the more control you have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.139 
the stitches the more control you have
and<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> focus<00:01:02.910> on

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and right now we're going to focus on

control<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> first<00:01:04.619> couple<00:01:04.860> lines

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
control so for the first couple lines

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
control so for the first couple lines
