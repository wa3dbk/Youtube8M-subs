00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello youtube friends with him alone 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.830
 I hope that well in this video tutorial 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.299
 I will teach you how to be an operator or 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.780
 administrator on one of those servers 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:14.150
 of control strike 1.6 this to do 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.180
 that should download the file on 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.080
 file that I will leave in description 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.150
 when the subject unloading it 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.029
 unzip on the desktop and open it 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.490
 the real point file and inside that 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.660
 file runs inside of mx 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.130
 mode x 1.8 point 1 point xxi give the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.059
 guardian in that little window of variety in 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 the s 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.780
 accepted our net terms 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.780
 leave us if you install them 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.210
 but we will make it install 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.809
 good we will give it to finish 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 if there would not be another one mentalist 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.720
 we could have accepted the terms of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.280
 selective director and select is 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.280
 lending the premises and only 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.540
 next and here we will look for the folder 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.600
 where we have our counter installed 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.600
 strike 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 then we will go to acs strike 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 inside the installation folder of the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.090
 strike context 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 and we arrived here and we waited for him to install 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 and in the riot we closed this file and 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.850
 that now to do the operators 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.340
 we will have to know this idea is extracted from 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.980
 your body I told you I bring you for six 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.440
 and the installation will have paid off 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:48.500
 will have given this new folders called 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.650
 we will open it we will go to mxx with fish and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.570
 where you say you use dot in and we open this 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.310
 this point file we would have 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.700
 in many, we will do for the best 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.490
 vision and good now in this they reach the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.330
 end of the part but at the end of the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.090
 document and where it says is and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.060
 we will buy all this little column what 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.510
 we will copy 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.780
 we will copy and now we will touch the button 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.840
 enter and we paste 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 what we will have to do is modify 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.190
 this column always copy make it 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.610
 a copy as I have done good 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.200
 now next in the first 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.340
 where it says the bucks in this from below 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.750
 we have to put our name 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.750
 he knows me from this name 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.700
 but we put our name and where 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.390
 are in these two lines we will place 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.640
 the password for our for the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.660
 administrator period this is 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960
 we 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.820
 in my case it will be I do not know 123 the case you 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.630
 right in any where it says of 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.440
 we'll place this leave it like this even though the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.670
 village that nothing good next 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.450
 we will keep in the changes that we have 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.050
 done and we will close the file by and 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.050
 check if it works 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.220
 flower if it worked 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.160
 to do this they must open their 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.530
 server 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.910
 only but here 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.910
 they have to open in their server 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.209
 but we'll do it until I made a server 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.480
 dedicated and good when all the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.000
 money a server was minimized and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.000
 we will open the counter strike 1.6 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.330
 to do that good now we have to 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.330
 enter the server 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.010
 when we have the contrast 16 we will have 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:19.900
 that place this command set 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:23.260
 info7 info wv 1 2 3 in your password 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.870
 w words and a space and its password 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.400
 We will leave this and command I will leave it 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.800

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.870
 server 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.210

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.039
 loading 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.220
 we have to check if there are many 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.220
 administrators 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.780
