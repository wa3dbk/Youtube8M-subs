00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello no that my kids I hope that 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.190
 you are well today I you 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.160
 finds 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.090
 review on a Japanese product the mask 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.800
 dewatering for people who do not 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.390
 do not know this mask it is about 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.180
 made of a black coal mask so 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.489
 like when I read a cute little 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.849
 little redhead shows on the picture that 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.680
 know took off his black peas so I 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.890
 will show you how it looks 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.540
 like that you 're fixed so yes it's 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.370
 a little bit of fun so success of the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.530
 sherbrooke / black coal obviously the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.870
 product is black it comes in a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.659
 form a little liquid 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.890
 finally see liquid we understand these 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.409
 consistent liquids I have not we 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.059
 explain to me and it's pretty thick like 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.010
 consistency but it's still a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.800
 little bit proud it's not a big 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.019
 super thick leg short it flows a 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.989
 little bit and so you apply this 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.479
 mask on the areas where you have some 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.440
 blackheads is so me 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.940
 basically on the nose even though I do not 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.600
 am not a really affected person 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.600
 by this scourge 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.270
 thankfully because this is this product 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.470
 personally I appreciate it but 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 no more because I'm not a 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.160
 nobody prone to blackheads 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.230
 if I make you this review it's thanks 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
 the car is especially for the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.270
 people who have a lot of points 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.160
 blacks who have tried every 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.540
 possible alternatives so I had done 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.040
 another video also about how 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.720
 remove these blackheads so 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.800
 natural with gelatin and milk 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.850
 and the patches that is extremely expensive 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.500
 this product if my cost between 5 and 10 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.210
 euros it depends on the game buyer so 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.910
 I made a video on the site 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.560
 aliexpress so a role and I talked about it 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.200
 if you're interested, I'll put you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.460
 the link of the video in the bar 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.570
 info and so this product me if I 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.579
 you talk about it here it's really for 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.810
 give you the maximum chance of 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.210
 can you get rid of it because 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.429
 it's still something pretty 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 embarrassing when we have a lot 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.250
 so I read so positive reviews 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.380
 that negatives are some people who 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.849
 where does it work thunder 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 to others where it does not work 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.900
 so this is a product to test 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.010
 personally - I do not have the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.180
 because of the ten bullets I do not see 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.599
 enormously different but I have when 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.330
 same as my skin has a little less 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.670
 so let's go for the review of the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.750
 product so here I did a close up 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.730
 for you to see a little bit better 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.130
 how to apply it so it's a 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.579
 produces this tube bottom of 80 grams 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.910
 which looks like this so you 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.610
 take on your finger a tiny 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.319
 amount of product a small hazelnut 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.870
 I'll use that to my nose it 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.940
 will be ample 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.230
 I shut up invoked nonsense that is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.680
 produce because it's fine 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 world so beforehand they say of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.359
 clean the skin and dry it 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:06.019
 correctly and then you apply 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:08.150
 so the product like these are only 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.950
 not extremely good I sometimes hide 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.950
 without passing 40 61 product with us 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.739
 it's a kind of thing for that 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.739
 market 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:54.060
 I do not have me it is a form that has me 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.010
 do me well everywhere you have to leave 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.390
 act for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.739
 I personally advise you 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.540
 plus 15 minutes pass like that you 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.489
 are sure that the mask is enough 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.510
 hard since it would have it will harden and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.060
 that's why you can 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.850
 snatch black dots 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 so we'll be back in fifteen minutes 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.440
 and we'll see what it's going to give to everything 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.760
 right now 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.560
 the mask is now dry so you 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.070
 see that the texture has become 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.890
 mast 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.310
 so I'm going to get a little bit 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.190
 for you to see a little bit better 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.010
 so when you shoot like this yes 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.370
 already who orders to kill to go away 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.840
 so it's going to go back in film form 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.180
 like a kind of small leaves so 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.450
 it's super easy you do like 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:49.169
 these is then you shoot like this 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:52.890
 is that's when all 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.180
 the black dots actually get removed 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.010
 personally I do not find it 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.190
 painful but apparently some 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:05.510
 people had a lot of pain doing 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.510
 this this step 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 personally it's okay 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.310
 circus axa so is you can 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.220
 then admire the magnificent points 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.740
 blacks that were torn off so if 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.740
 I can focus 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.130
 so here you can admire the 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.340
 black dots that were ripped from the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.770
 surface so obviously I do not have 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.380
 not much for almost not because 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.920
 that ben I am not a subject person 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.630
 to blackheads as you can the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.120
 so notice when there are still 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.110
 little traces like these are waiting 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.990
 and I still want to put in mode 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.510
 normal it's a little bit a little bit 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.150
 chelou game but we have team but when 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.210
 but there are limits 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.610
 so this kind of his gills so you 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.860
 have small traces on the nose 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.480
 do not worry it smells great 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.210
 easily with water you take a 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.830
 little water engulfs high and it's gone 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.570
 besides if when you tear off the pat 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.380
 you find that it's too much 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.610
 badly you can wet it then sarr of 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.040
 the order in cash but then the action 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.090
 is not going to work it's just me 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.830
 personally I do not find it 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.500
 hurt but I apparently read that 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.690
 some places of the skin it was 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.190
 extremely badly 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.510
 so do not worry seven years the 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.270
 May 20 no problem just take them 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.650
 boils and it will become liquid 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.540
 then after doing this step 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.610
 but you can still feel that 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.490
 your your skin is a little bit more 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.870
 smooth do I advise you to 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.800
 to do is moisturize afterwards because 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.420
 that it dries to moisturize it for 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.160
 to rehydrate it because I imagine 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.360
 that since it has its chances is not 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.800
 super good for the number a bola the leg 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.070
 so here I hope that this little 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.080
 video on black charcoal mask 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.090

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.560
 discovered a product for people 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.880
 who will ask in question 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.370
 how does it work and 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.750
 it's okay now here you know 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.750

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.280

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.990

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.270
 place on the part of a video fault 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.850
 where I put all the coordinates with 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.040
 the price etc knowing that it can change 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.900
 from one personality to have to another 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.580
