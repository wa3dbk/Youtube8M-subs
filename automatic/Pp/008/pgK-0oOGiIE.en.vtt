00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello people and I came to make a video here 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.639
 a little different, I remember that in the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.050
 end of the year the law about 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.799
 Christianity a constituted religion 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.540
 by men is not when I talked about 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 This I said in the sense of what they did 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.850
 This Christianity is I want to say that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 A little bit about some leaders exists 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.230
 your exceptions exist 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 there are some religious leaders I 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.410
 I'm referring to the fact that there are pastors 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.250
 bishops apostles to babalorixÃ¡s to parents 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 and many other religious leaders who 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 there are exceptions that are men of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.460
 character of man positions 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.510
 seek to benefit society 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.570
 men looking to help people 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 institutions and people who help 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 marriages in the matter pass by busting 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.850
 and arrives with his due advice 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.579
 there is a structuring of people who are 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.610
 good in religion and make their 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.130
 something very beneficial and not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.290
 evil that this time I'm 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.150
 with you here on the internet and I'm 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 analyzing content and sometimes analyzing 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.840
 behavior of some people does not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 I'm saying that I'm the man 100% 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.240
 a hunger nobody is in this world 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 so I come here to make it say no 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.729
 I know there are religious leaders and not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.280
 solid more people humans 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.439
 are good not because they are linked to a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.170
 but they are good because they have a 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.810
 beneficial character and other persons who 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.579
 had a bad character had an attitude 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.549
 bad before society 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.189
 religion helped them very much is the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.470
 Christian religion the spiritist religion 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.180
 kardecism catholicism 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 they call it or the Muslim religion at last 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.659
 there is a beneficent evil side and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.060
 all religions 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.140
 just as there are beneficial and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.540
 evil 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 then all this then sometimes some 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 people are bothered by some of the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 my videos but if it bothers you it 's 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.030
 because something is being good 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.510
 advantage or hope you bother me 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.790
 be likely to 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.829
 search but not become a person 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.700
 worse for a religion you follow 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:24.209
 So you have to do your own thing. 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.250
 religion is good for you and your 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.970
 family and those who are at your 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.340
 around 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.010
 so here 's a video of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 thanks to the religious leaders who 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.140
 have their good character and make the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.090
 difference in society 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.190
 but this video here is also the video 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.220
 I am saying to you leader who is bad 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.609
 character that you make of your religion a 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.819
 trash a crap a a manipulation 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.500
 to manipulate people to get a good 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.129
 benefit over them 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.069
 So this video for you that you 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:02.519
 should be a person within the 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.190
 society excluded because for those who deal 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.500
 with human beings must at least 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.870
 say of what you believe to be 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.129
 these people are true. 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.769
 better logical 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.040
 change comes from every human being but 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 a religion it can greatly influence 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.919
 in helping the psychological for many 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.790
 People then do not criticize religions 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:32.940
 critical to manipulations and content 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.000
 legalist that is used to manipulate 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 so you have a vote to congratulate 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.060
 all religious leaders who have a 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.150
 good character and makes the difference in 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.799
 society in their religion and in the world 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.799
 thank you until the next champions
