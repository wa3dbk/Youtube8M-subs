there to open up this area down here

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.750 
there to open up this area down here
there's<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:29.039> there's<00:00:29.310> gonna<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.580> two

there's first there's gonna be two

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
there's first there's gonna be two
sockets<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:32.630> here<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.340> then<00:00:36.290> there<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.530> one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
sockets here here and then there was one

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
sockets here here and then there was one
more<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> needed<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> use<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.239> needed<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> use<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
more I needed to use I needed to use the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.610 
more I needed to use I needed to use the
8<00:00:40.469> millimeter<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> ground<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.620> but

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
8 millimeter for the ground here but

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
8 millimeter for the ground here but
anyways<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> passport<00:00:47.420> 9500<00:00:48.420> X<00:00:48.780> I

anyways so I have the passport 9500 X I

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.700 
anyways so I have the passport 9500 X I
and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.340> fed<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> wire<00:00:51.300> through<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and I fed the wire through here it's a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520 
and I fed the wire through here it's a
bit<00:00:53.460> difficult<00:00:53.640> without<00:00:54.210> any<00:00:54.629> credit<00:00:55.260> card<00:00:55.440> or

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
bit difficult without any credit card or

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
bit difficult without any credit card or
anything<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.280> sure<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.940> two

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to push it in there so I push it in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.209 
to push it in there so I push it in
through<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.620> open<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
through here I open this up this is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
through here I open this up this is
fairly<00:01:02.520> easy<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.940> open<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fairly easy to open it you just have to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.399 
fairly easy to open it you just have to
pop<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:06.030> pull<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.659> once<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
pop it out here and pull up once you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
pop it out here and pull up once you
pull<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.119> bit

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
pull that up you can have a little bit

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
pull that up you can have a little bit
of<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.390> opening<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.439> feed<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of an opening and then you just feed the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.590 
of an opening and then you just feed the
wire<00:01:11.060> through<00:01:12.500> feed<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> wire<00:01:13.799> through<00:01:14.100> here

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
wire through feed the wire through here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.980 
wire through feed the wire through here
going<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.590> until<00:01:17.479> here<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
going all the way down until here this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.370 
going all the way down until here this
area<00:01:19.290> pops<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:20.159> fairly<00:01:20.909> easily<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
area pops out fairly easily it's this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
area pops out fairly easily it's this
part<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:24.090> grab<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> hole<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
part right here you just grab a hole to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.010 
part right here you just grab a hole to
that<00:01:25.080> spot<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> pop<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> out

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
that spot right there and pop it out

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
that spot right there and pop it out
once<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> wire<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
once you get the wire through there you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.870 
once you get the wire through there you
can<00:01:29.579> feed<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> wire<00:01:30.180> through<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
can feed the wire through here and it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.770 
can feed the wire through here and it
goes<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> got<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:36.270> all

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
goes in here and then I got it going all

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
goes in here and then I got it going all
the<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.009> wire<00:01:38.189> from<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> radar

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the way this is the wire from the radar

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
the way this is the wire from the radar
I<00:01:39.030> got<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:39.990> through<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I got it going through here and then I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
I got it going through here and then I
connected<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.659> smart<00:01:43.259> cord<00:01:44.360> thing<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
connected it to my smart cord thing so I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.980 
connected it to my smart cord thing so I
can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.079> right<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.619> whenever<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.990> am

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
can see that right there whenever I am

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
can see that right there whenever I am
driving<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.130> driving<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> road

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
driving you know I'm driving on the road

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.080 
driving you know I'm driving on the road
I<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> down<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> hooked<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I can see it down there so I hooked it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.289 
I can see it down there so I hooked it
up<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.880> wire<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
up to here and that's the the wire that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
up to here and that's the the wire that
goes<00:01:57.360> from<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.590> radar<00:01:58.979> to<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.500> wire<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
goes from the the radar to the wire that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.410 
goes from the the radar to the wire that
goes<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.350> radar<00:02:04.560> plus<00:02:05.299> connecting<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
goes to the radar plus connecting to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.050 
goes to the radar plus connecting to
here<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.619> there's<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.459> power<00:02:08.640> wire

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
here and then there's the power wire

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.720 
here and then there's the power wire
which<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> connect<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.410> connected<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.400> going

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
which you connect I connected it going

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.289 
which you connect I connected it going
through<00:02:11.910> here

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
through here

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.569 
through here
and<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.989> wires<00:02:14.260> very<00:02:14.530> short<00:02:15.159> they<00:02:15.310> give<00:02:15.459> you

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
and the wires very short they give you

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.280 
and the wires very short they give you
very<00:02:15.609> short<00:02:16.090> wires<00:02:16.269> so<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:16.719> a<00:02:16.750> truck<00:02:17.109> it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
very short wires so for a truck it's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.580 
very short wires so for a truck it's
kind<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.560> hard<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:18.000> find<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.180> spot<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:20.379> luckily

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
kind of hard to find a spot but luckily

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.830 
kind of hard to find a spot but luckily
I<00:02:20.799> had<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.640> little<00:02:22.590> intercom<00:02:23.590> system<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
I had a little intercom system here that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.789 
I had a little intercom system here that
I<00:02:25.840> connected<00:02:27.599> connected<00:02:28.599> this<00:02:28.780> wire<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.590> this

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
I connected connected this wire to this

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.440 
I connected connected this wire to this
is<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.980> why<00:02:30.099> they<00:02:30.250> give<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.639> connect<00:02:31.359> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
is the why they give you connect this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.879 
is the why they give you connect this
video<00:02:31.689> a<00:02:31.719> little<00:02:31.900> fuse<00:02:32.319> with<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.739> well<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
video a little fuse with it as well I

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:40.050 
video a little fuse with it as well I
connected<00:02:35.889> that<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.859> power<00:02:39.060> side

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
connected that to the the power side

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.970 
connected that to the the power side
which<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.349> red<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.769> I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
which is you know the red here I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.009 
which is you know the red here I
connected<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:46.019> this

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
connected it to that and this this

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.080 
connected it to that and this this
intercom<00:02:47.560> system<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.280> hooked<00:02:48.819> up<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
intercom system is hooked up to a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.159 
intercom system is hooked up to a
something<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.239> whenever<00:02:52.419> I<00:02:52.599> turn<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
something that whenever I turn on the

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.140 
something that whenever I turn on the
ignition<00:02:55.379> it<00:02:56.379> turns<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.609> right<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:57.939> it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
ignition it turns on so right now it's

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.399 
ignition it turns on so right now it's
off<00:02:58.299> that's<00:02:59.260> off<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.250> my<00:03:00.400> radars<00:03:00.819> off<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:02.349> I

off that's off and my radars off and I

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.490 
off that's off and my radars off and I
just<00:03:02.560> wanted<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.799> see<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.239> works<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.810> so

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
just wanted to see if this works here so

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.709 
just wanted to see if this works here so
I<00:03:05.530> got<00:03:05.739> my<00:03:05.859> keys<00:03:07.469> I<00:03:08.969> turned<00:03:09.969> it<00:03:10.060> into<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.659> C

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
comment down below this is the best I

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.580 
comment down below this is the best I
could<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.659> with<00:03:43.659> what<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.870> had

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
could do with what I had

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.640 
could do with what I had
once<00:03:45.340> again<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:46.359> wires<00:03:46.659> really<00:03:47.139> short<00:03:47.470> so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
once again this wires really short so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.990 
once again this wires really short so
there's<00:03:47.829> nowhere<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.310> could<00:03:48.459> really<00:03:48.609> hook<00:03:48.879> it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
there's nowhere you could really hook it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.020 
there's nowhere you could really hook it
up<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.329> unless<00:03:49.659> you<00:03:49.810> find<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.049> different<00:03:50.349> spot

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
up to unless you find a different spot

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.750 
up to unless you find a different spot
that'd<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.150> cool<00:03:52.269> all<00:03:52.689> right
