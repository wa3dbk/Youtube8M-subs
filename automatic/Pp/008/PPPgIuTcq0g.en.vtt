middle mouse button or the T key by
default<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.900> if<00:00:32.410> you<00:00:32.469> don't<00:00:32.619> have<00:00:32.739> it<00:00:32.829> bound

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:32.979 
default and if you don't have it bound

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:34.469 
default and if you don't have it bound
to<00:00:33.069> something<00:00:33.339> that's<00:00:33.519> comfortable<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.210> easy

that so that's a mouse thumb button or
the<00:00:39.309> Q<00:00:39.639> key<00:00:39.850> or<00:00:40.059> even<00:00:40.359> the<00:00:40.449> V<00:00:40.629> key<00:00:40.899> for<00:00:41.170> some

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
the Q key or even the V key for some

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.610 
the Q key or even the V key for some
people<00:00:41.589> depending<00:00:41.739> on<00:00:42.190> your<00:00:42.399> hand<00:00:42.670> position

that I guess and the fact that there is
a<00:02:14.019> delay

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
a delay

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.680 
a delay
while<00:02:14.890> coming<00:02:15.280> down<00:02:15.430> from<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.730> sprint<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.540> this

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
while coming down from a sprint so this

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.210 
while coming down from a sprint so this
isn't<00:02:16.870> an<00:02:17.050> ice<00:02:17.200> specific<00:02:17.710> thing<00:02:17.890> though<00:02:18.040> it's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
isn't an ice specific thing though it's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.340 
isn't an ice specific thing though it's
with<00:02:18.400> everything<00:02:18.640> if<00:02:19.240> you're<00:02:19.420> sprinting<00:02:19.900> it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
with everything if you're sprinting it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.720 
with everything if you're sprinting it's
gonna<00:02:20.500> take<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.830> longer<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> aim<00:02:21.310> down<00:02:21.340> sights

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
gonna take you longer to aim down sights

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.400 
gonna take you longer to aim down sights
gonna<00:02:22.030> take<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.270> longer<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.510> throw<00:02:22.720> c4<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
gonna take you longer to throw c4 and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.860 
gonna take you longer to throw c4 and
even<00:02:24.250> longer<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.610> hipfire<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.780> is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
even longer to hipfire and this is

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.270 
even longer to hipfire and this is
because<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> game<00:02:26.410> factors<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.040> what's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
because the game factors in what's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.760 
because the game factors in what's
probably<00:02:27.520> about<00:02:28.030> half<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.450> second<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:29.530> to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
probably about half a second of time to

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.040 
probably about half a second of time to
come<00:02:30.010> down<00:02:30.040> from<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.850> sprint<00:02:31.150> or<00:02:31.480> otherwise

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
come down from a sprint or otherwise

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.320 
come down from a sprint or otherwise
return<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.710> walking<00:02:33.100> speed<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:34.180> has

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
return to walking speed and this has

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.730 
return to walking speed and this has
implications<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:35.050> course<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.620> you're

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
implications of course because if you're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.470 
implications of course because if you're
chasing<00:02:35.980> an<00:02:36.280> enemy<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:37.030> know<00:02:37.150> you're<00:02:37.300> right

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
chasing an enemy you know you're right

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.850 
chasing an enemy you know you're right
on<00:02:37.600> their<00:02:37.720> tail<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.960> mean<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.320> right<00:02:38.620> behind

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
on their tail I mean like right behind

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.650 
on their tail I mean like right behind
them<00:02:39.280> oftentimes<00:02:39.970> you're<00:02:40.240> gonna<00:02:40.330> miss<00:02:40.510> your

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
them oftentimes you're gonna miss your

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.420 
them oftentimes you're gonna miss your
knife<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.080> that's<00:02:41.710> because<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.220> half

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
knife and that's because of the half

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.980 
knife and that's because of the half
second<00:02:42.820> delay<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.240> you're<00:02:43.360> also<00:02:43.540> losing

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
second delay where you're also losing

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.030 
second delay where you're also losing

you that said the knife can be pretty

you that said the knife can be pretty
iffy<00:03:23.459> at<00:03:23.549> times<00:03:23.760> I've<00:03:24.060> had<00:03:24.209> many<00:03:24.450> times<00:03:24.659> where

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
iffy at times I've had many times where

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.780 
iffy at times I've had many times where
I'd<00:03:25.319> knife<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.680> guy<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:25.980> twice<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> row<00:03:26.549> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I'd knife a guy just twice in a row and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
I'd knife a guy just twice in a row and
the<00:03:27.150> second<00:03:27.450> knife<00:03:27.569> would<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.140> any<00:03:28.290> damage

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the second knife would not do any damage

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830 
the second knife would not do any damage
and<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.430> way<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.579> circumvent<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.480> seems

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
and the way to circumvent this it seems

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.020 
and the way to circumvent this it seems
is<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.470> wait<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.920> fraction<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.700> second

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
is to just wait a fraction of a second

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.759 
is to just wait a fraction of a second
longer<00:03:33.150> after<00:03:33.840> your<00:03:33.959> first<00:03:34.109> knife<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.620> then

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
longer after your first knife and then

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.860 
longer after your first knife and then
you<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.129> your<00:03:35.310> second<00:03:35.700> knife<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.120> there<00:03:36.720> are

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
you do your second knife and there are

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.780 
you do your second knife and there are
some<00:03:37.349> Kona<00:03:37.709> fire<00:03:37.890> attributes<00:03:38.400> attached<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
some Kona fire attributes attached to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
some Kona fire attributes attached to
the<00:03:38.879> knife<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> stats<00:03:39.660> screen<00:03:40.079> for

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the knife and the stats screen for

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.660 
the knife and the stats screen for
whatever<00:03:40.620> reason<00:03:41.069> but<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.250> don't<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.519> they

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
whatever reason but I don't think they

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.520 
whatever reason but I don't think they
actually<00:03:41.940> play<00:03:42.150> into<00:03:42.359> this<00:03:42.599> or<00:03:42.780> anything<00:03:43.019> else

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
actually play into this or anything else

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.990 
actually play into this or anything else
the<00:03:43.829> problem<00:03:44.190> probably<00:03:44.430> stems<00:03:44.760> from

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
the problem probably stems from

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000 
the problem probably stems from
oversampling<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> weapon<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.799> you're

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
oversampling the weapon so you're

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.470 
oversampling the weapon so you're
clicking<00:03:47.190> too<00:03:47.489> fast<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.239> plays<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
clicking too fast so it plays the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.630 
clicking too fast so it plays the
animation<00:03:49.079> but<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.349> doesn't<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.799> do

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
animation but it doesn't actually do

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.830 
animation but it doesn't actually do
anything<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.060> doesn't<00:03:51.180> actually<00:03:51.390> have<00:03:51.720> an

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
anything it doesn't actually have an

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.809 
anything it doesn't actually have an
effect<00:03:51.930> at<00:03:52.829> least<00:03:52.920> that's<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.459> kind<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.730> what

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
effect at least that's just kind of what

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.150 
effect at least that's just kind of what
I<00:03:53.849> guess<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.299> going<00:03:54.450> on

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.090 

so<00:03:58.030> that's<00:03:58.210> the<00:03:58.360> knife<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.780> nutshell<00:03:58.990> as<00:03:59.350> far

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
so that's the knife in a nutshell as far

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.590 
so that's the knife in a nutshell as far
as<00:04:00.220> general<00:04:00.460> strategy<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:00.970> concerned<00:04:01.180> there

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
as general strategy is concerned there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.540 
as general strategy is concerned there
are<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> few<00:04:02.110> things<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:03.190> should<00:04:03.220> think

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
are a few things that you should think

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.150 
are a few things that you should think
about<00:04:03.930> lead<00:04:04.930> with<00:04:05.140> your<00:04:05.290> weapon<00:04:05.590> first<00:04:05.860> and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
about lead with your weapon first and

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.340 
about lead with your weapon first and
then<00:04:06.460> your<00:04:06.640> knife<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:07.210> finish<00:04:07.540> doing<00:04:08.080> it<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
then your knife to finish doing it the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.600 
then your knife to finish doing it the
other<00:04:08.470> way<00:04:08.620> around<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:09.010> slower<00:04:09.370> because

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
other way around is slower because

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.790 
other way around is slower because
remember<00:04:10.330> that<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.570> damage<00:04:11.140> comes<00:04:11.410> instantly

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
remember that the damage comes instantly

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.860 
remember that the damage comes instantly
as<00:04:12.130> soon<00:04:12.370> as<00:04:12.460> you<00:04:12.580> press<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.970> button<00:04:13.240> but<00:04:13.750> then

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
as soon as you press the button but then

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.510 
as soon as you press the button but then
you're<00:04:13.990> subject<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.560> delay<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.190> going

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
you're subject to the delay of going

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.400 
you're subject to the delay of going
through<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.880> knife<00:04:16.030> animation<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.840> pulling

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
through the knife animation and pulling

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.620 
through the knife animation and pulling
your<00:04:17.500> weapon<00:04:17.709> back<00:04:17.890> up<00:04:18.100> so<00:04:18.670> your<00:04:19.060> knife<00:04:19.239> should

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
your weapon back up so your knife should

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.720 
your weapon back up so your knife should
be<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.020> finisher<00:04:20.620> always<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.370> should<00:04:21.550> not<00:04:21.670> be

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
be a finisher always and should not be

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.370 
be a finisher always and should not be
an<00:04:21.910> opener<00:04:22.300> unless<00:04:22.600> you're<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.990> be

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
an opener unless you're going to be

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.860 
an opener unless you're going to be

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
pulling off a to swing kill for the sake

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.950 
pulling off a to swing kill for the sake
of<00:04:25.930> humiliation<00:04:27.180> this<00:04:28.180> plays<00:04:28.420> into<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.750> first
