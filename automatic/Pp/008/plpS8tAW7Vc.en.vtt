00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.500
 must distinguish we have this in 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.210
 this week both at league level 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.669
 as well as with the fb very intense 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.699
 have had sessions concern the second 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.499
 game class factum is 13 14 changed 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.390
 Once nothing at all goes now 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.970
 it is assumed that 14 15 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.349
 the regional league champions directly 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.609
 but it is still possible 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.640
 not only did not it pronounce it 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.289
 there are two regional allies and at the moment 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.270
 Looks like the amateur is not 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.710
 can ascend even if you master 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.640
 become 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.410
 I believe that this is the last word 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 not yet spoken and us 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.320
 often just think about it 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.510
 the boys are developing now 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.989
 how we do that best possible 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.820
 can 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.350
 We are here in the very, very proud of what 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.789
 also, therefore, gaga will be with this young 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.739
 troupe and we really play along 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.980
 a young troupe in the regionalliga 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.570
 The east has reached this autumn 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 is the future exhibitor from the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.170
 academy come after good bush and me 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.150
 can promise as if everything for it 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.750
 do the best of conditions 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.549
 create 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.020
 and as I said the league discussion is 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.509
 not finished yet for me 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.920
 there is a big chance but that's what i do 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.619
 also said the week it is unfortunately 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.990
 so the self-interests are diverse 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.720
 clubs and associations the development of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.899
 Austrian football so to speak 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.070
 exceed 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.659
 but we will not let it 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.130
 stay with austria vienna are up 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.810
 A good way and these are the amateur 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.700
 a very important beautiful one always has to 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.369
 Sporting and striving for the highest 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.280
 if it were possible and we did 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.549
 could feel there because then it has to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.439
 our goal is but I say now 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.210
 we saw with our young team 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.549
 certainly very good in the regionalliga 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.750
 canceled 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.930
 our young players are very good 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.439
 and you have to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.180
 watch 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.909
 I think that it is important for 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.810
 him one 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.090
 a game that you can just there 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.130
 to really get a hold of you 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 At that time warriors would say that's it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.679
 something else in the regionalliga 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.619
 that looks dr there is the fight yet 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.690
 Harder gets four points and I think 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.069
 That should definitely be back 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 The amateur teams will be introduced 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.239
 can get up again because I think 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.860
 we have very good players 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.739
 this earned investors higher 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.930
 play and that is in my opinion 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.799
 very important for the event 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.760
 but also for the Austrian 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:30.150
 wm football again 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.860
 would be sought by solutions then 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.620
 then I have to say if that again 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.930
 relegation comes and so on if so 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.959
 what is there in the room so then must 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.480
 they interphone if that then again 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.640
 makes sense and then again may soar 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.280
 directly on a game again relegation 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 or not or I know that me 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:59.549
 but it's like I think so 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.260
 that it would be sporty possible if 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.790
 you already go into the season and what 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.440
 you can do more effort then it is 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 of course, think the sense of the thing 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.790
 I 'm with the one the regionalliga 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.650
 ascend to the third league of course 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.459
 a great springboard for the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.280
 bundesliga ladies regionalliga bundesliga 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.080
 is 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.730
 at first then maybe even relatively 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.700
 big jump some people manage it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.500
 shops and the honest is natural 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.140
 easier if you already have a professional team 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.850
 play the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.160
 partial ambitions have the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.600
 to play the Bundesliga and I think so 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.420
 that they have enough of ours from mine 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.230
 vintage miscellaneous about the game then 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.010
 have evolved and there now 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.140
 Bundesliga game 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.740
 But our goal must be the matter of the boy 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.920
 team to approach the young talents 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.410
 lead and and that come in the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.930
 regionalliga high star very good though 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.280
 of course his ambitious round and because 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.430
 one is naturally shocked best 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.590
 get out and if it would rise there 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.110
 in the second league then then must 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 give it to him as an opel if it then reach 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.930
 This is also used by other paper sheets 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.489
 we tried this in this 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.040
 We are always involved in discussions 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.000
 I'm also in the in the said 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.709
 league function 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.090
 We have to remember the clubs 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.769
 At the time it understood this 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 experimentally given to the twelve league 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.519
 with 33 rounds that's not ideal though 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.959
 Many things are mixed up 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.400
 I think we have to be athletic 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.780
 economically and infrastructural 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.430
 to find the best option 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.990
 But we also know that models like 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.910
 For example, Salzburg with the world 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.020
 delivery or pasching also not the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.090
 wisdom last conclusion are the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.800
 Importance is for us to form 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.390
 academy great players for mixes 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.470
 give a platform with the second 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.330
 team and that he works best 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.190
 can develop upwards and that 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.020
 We will think about what I am for us 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.330
 can promise that we will leave this 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.979
 and best for our amateurs 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.450
 become flat and in the league 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.870
 Discussions and bring in so far 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.450
 become 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.640
 what i always said in ours 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.440
 Development were the amateur team 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
 in the second performance level the best 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.180
 there are the careers of heinz 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.610
 lindner markus shoves or michael 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.780
 Madl we saw today 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.130
 originated and many simkovic us 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.950
 green forest etc 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.330
 So that was something and I think so 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.890
 that is our responsibility that we 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.630
 our young players also after the 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.789
 Academy the best possible transition 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.900
 shape and how we find ourselves in the liga- 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.900
 and fit again
