00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.510 
reports that there's 50 million pounds
at<00:01:10.330> stake<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:10.869> that's<00:01:10.990> what<00:01:11.289> he's<00:01:11.680> reportedly

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
at stake and that's what he's reportedly

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.550 
at stake and that's what he's reportedly
has<00:01:12.759> offered<00:01:13.270> her<00:01:13.420> but<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.930> seems<00:01:14.200> like<00:01:14.440> the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
has offered her but it seems like the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.800 
has offered her but it seems like the
sticking<00:01:15.009> point<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.810> confidentiality

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
sticking point is a confidentiality

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.029 
sticking point is a confidentiality
clause<00:01:17.080> at<00:01:17.350> least<00:01:17.500> that's<00:01:17.710> what's<00:01:17.890> been

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
clause at least that's what's been

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.830 
clause at least that's what's been
reported<00:01:18.190> which<00:01:18.970> would<00:01:19.210> forbid<00:01:19.420> her<00:01:19.810> from

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
reported which would forbid her from

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380 
reported which would forbid her from
ever<00:01:20.200> talking<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.369> divorce<00:01:21.729> once<00:01:22.149> it's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
ever talking about the divorce once it's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.149 
ever talking about the divorce once it's
finalized<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.560> seems<00:01:23.770> like<00:01:23.920> Heather's

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
finalized and it seems like Heather's

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.160 
finalized and it seems like Heather's
reluctant<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.360> sign<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.780> thing<00:01:25.840> which

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
reluctant to sign this thing which

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.279 
reluctant to sign this thing which
actually<00:01:26.860> makes<00:01:27.069> a<00:01:27.250> lot<00:01:27.369> of<00:01:27.429> sense<00:01:27.819> because<00:01:28.720> if

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
actually makes a lot of sense because if

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.800 
actually makes a lot of sense because if

of horses I think a lot of people are
also<00:02:05.500> wondering<00:02:06.130> why<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:06.850> was<00:02:07.000> no<00:02:07.149> prenup<00:02:07.659> I

also wondering why there was no prenup I

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.990 
also wondering why there was no prenup I

thing that a lot of people don't know I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.170 
thing that a lot of people don't know I
think<00:02:11.440> it's<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.769> very<00:02:11.890> Hollywood<00:02:12.220> concept<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
think it's a very Hollywood concept the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.270 
think it's a very Hollywood concept the
prenup<00:02:13.630> but<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.019> England<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:14.980> law<00:02:15.220> today
