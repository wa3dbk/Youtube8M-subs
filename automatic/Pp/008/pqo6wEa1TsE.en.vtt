makes it so easy so you can see the
lines<00:02:57.340> through<00:02:57.610> there<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> would<00:02:58.060> trace<00:02:58.480> all

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
lines through there so I would trace all

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.050 
lines through there so I would trace all
those<00:02:59.080> lines<00:02:59.380> out<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.920> then<00:03:00.610> I'm<00:03:00.730> going<00:03:01.000> to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060 
those lines out and then I'm going to
cut<00:03:01.390> apart<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.170> fusible<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.770> I'm<00:03:02.860> just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070

cut apart on the fusible and I'm just
going<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.250> trace<00:03:03.610> one<00:03:04.710> piece<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:06.070> then<00:03:06.160> I'm

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280

light weight that I'm playing with

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.530 
light weight that I'm playing with
that's<00:03:30.430> really<00:03:30.730> cool<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.120> then<00:03:31.330> there'll<00:03:31.510> be

I<00:03:37.360> do<00:03:37.420> not<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.020> tattoo<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.620> says<00:03:38.860> heat

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
I do not have a tattoo that says heat

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.210 
I do not have a tattoo that says heat
and<00:03:39.459> bond<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.260> guess<00:03:41.260> if<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.590> did<00:03:41.860> though<00:03:42.040> and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and bond I guess if I did though and

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.330 
and bond I guess if I did though and
then<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.340> had<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> removed<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.660> think<00:03:43.900> I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
then I had to have it removed I think I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.390 
then I had to have it removed I think I
take<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.520> mm<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.450> N<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.200> bond<00:03:47.440> off<00:03:47.890> and

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
take the mm the N and the bond off and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.580 
take the mm the N and the bond off and
then<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.630> heat<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.170> what<00:03:50.290> I'm<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
then it's a heat so what I'm in the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.710 
then it's a heat so what I'm in the
nursing<00:03:50.950> home<00:03:51.070> they<00:03:51.220> take<00:03:51.400> off<00:03:51.580> he's<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.030> lot<00:03:52.420> it

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
nursing home they take off he's a lot it

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.380 
nursing home they take off he's a lot it
says<00:03:52.930> heat<00:03:53.140> okay<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.370> let's<00:03:54.670> say<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.060> trace

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
says heat okay so let's say that I trace

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.530 
says heat okay so let's say that I trace
this<00:03:55.570> whole<00:03:55.840> thing<00:03:56.080> out<00:03:56.290> okay<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:58.209> what

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
this whole thing out okay so then what

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.780 
this whole thing out okay so then what
when<00:03:58.900> you're<00:03:59.140> cutting<00:03:59.680> out<00:03:59.950> with<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.310> fusible

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
when you're cutting out with a fusible

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.470 
you to do it because you're getting
fusible<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.920> edge<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.250> each<00:04:28.460> piece<00:04:28.820> do<00:04:29.210> not

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
fusible to the edge of each piece do not

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.600 
fusible to the edge of each piece do not
cut<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.230> you're<00:04:30.410> drawn<00:04:30.650> line<00:04:31.040> until<00:04:31.370> it's<00:04:31.490> on

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
cut on you're drawn line until it's on

cut on you're drawn line until it's on
the<00:04:31.850> back<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.240> fabric<00:04:32.390> so<00:04:33.320> what<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.560> will<00:04:33.710> do

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
the back of the fabric so what I will do

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.210 
the back of the fabric so what I will do
is<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.640> will<00:04:34.720> cut<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:36.110> between<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.800> two<00:04:36.980> pieces

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
is I will cut in between the two pieces

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.430 
is I will cut in between the two pieces
see<00:04:38.000> I've<00:04:38.300> left<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.630> little<00:04:38.780> bit<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.080> fusible

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
see I've left a little bit of fusible

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.490 
see I've left a little bit of fusible
around<00:04:39.860> each<00:04:40.040> piece<00:04:40.570> then<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.600> will<00:04:41.990> fuse<00:04:42.320> it

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
around each piece then I will fuse it

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.220 
around each piece then I will fuse it
this<00:04:42.800> goes<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> blue<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.540> then<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.750> will<00:04:45.020> fuse

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
this goes to a blue so then I will fuse

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.560 
this goes to a blue so then I will fuse
it<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> back<00:04:45.830> of<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.130> blue<00:04:46.310> then<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.760> will

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
it to the back of the blue then I will

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.240 
it to the back of the blue then I will
cut<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.930> my<00:04:48.080> drawn<00:04:48.350> line<00:04:50.380> this<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.440> one<00:04:51.920> block

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
cut on my drawn line this is one block

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.300 
cut on my drawn line this is one block
and<00:04:52.730> I<00:04:53.450> tell<00:04:53.750> you<00:04:53.900> how<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.170> mark<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:55.070> black

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
and I tell you how to mark the black

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.730 
and I tell you how to mark the black
borders<00:04:55.880> on<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.270> blocks<00:04:56.540> that's<00:04:57.440> put

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
borders on the blocks that's put

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.890 
borders on the blocks that's put
together<00:04:57.860> as<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:58.610> now<00:04:58.910> when<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> have<00:04:59.660> you

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
draw a chalk line that goes down through

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.700 
draw a chalk line that goes down through
the<00:05:03.260> center<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.800> across<00:05:04.370> in<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:04.820> center<00:05:05.270> I

the center and across in the center I

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.430 
the center and across in the center I
draw<00:05:06.710> my<00:05:06.950> pattern<00:05:07.460> so<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:07.790> this<00:05:08.330> tip<00:05:08.810> will

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
draw my pattern so that this tip will

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.590 
draw my pattern so that this tip will
line<00:05:09.680> up<00:05:09.710> with<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.160> chalk<00:05:10.430> line<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:10.760> this<00:05:11.270> tip

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
will line up with a chalk line there is

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.570 
will line up with a chalk line there is
no<00:05:14.090> way<00:05:14.420> to<00:05:14.960> mess<00:05:15.200> up<00:05:15.440> on<00:05:15.650> this<00:05:15.860> because<00:05:16.160> mahmud
