00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
warming filter is pretty good for this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.180 
warming filter is pretty good for this
type<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.210> photo<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.590> want<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.009> add

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
