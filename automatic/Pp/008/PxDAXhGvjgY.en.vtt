we<00:00:03.540> thought<00:00:03.780> that<00:00:03.810> you'd<00:00:04.080> like<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.259> see<00:00:04.560> a

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we thought that you'd like to see a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.530 
we thought that you'd like to see a
couple<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.220> samples<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.940> fabrics<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.450> are

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
couple of samples of fabrics that are

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.890 
couple of samples of fabrics that are
usually<00:00:06.930> very<00:00:06.960> difficult<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.859> print<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.900> this

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
usually very difficult to print and this

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.690 
usually very difficult to print and this
one<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> lightweight<00:00:10.559> polyester<00:00:11.250> mesh

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
one is a lightweight polyester mesh

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.060 
one is a lightweight polyester mesh
usually<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> put<00:00:13.139> additives<00:00:13.559> into

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
usually you have to put additives into

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.250 
usually you have to put additives into
your<00:00:14.219> ink<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:15.210> even<00:00:15.389> think<00:00:15.599> about<00:00:15.690> printing<00:00:16.080> on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
your ink to even think about printing on

this fabric here this this sample was

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
this fabric here this this sample was
printed<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.100> two<00:00:20.250> transparent<00:00:20.939> colors<00:00:21.390> of

job<00:00:34.969> here's<00:00:35.969> another<00:00:36.270> sample<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> stretch

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
job here's another sample of a stretch

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
job here's another sample of a stretch
fabric<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> spandex<00:00:39.989> or

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
fabric and this is like a spandex or

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010 
fabric and this is like a spandex or
lycra<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.829> used<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.190> swimwear<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.870> can

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
lycra that's used in swimwear you can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
lycra that's used in swimwear you can
see<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> ink<00:00:43.710> coating<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> very

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
see that the ink coating is very

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.560 
see that the ink coating is very
flexible<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> special<00:00:47.760> polymer<00:00:48.180> resin

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
flexible it's a special polymer resin

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
flexible it's a special polymer resin
and<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.960> also<00:00:49.079> helps<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> pigment

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and it also helps that the pigment

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
and it also helps that the pigment
particles<00:00:50.129> are<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.700> fine<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.780> only<00:00:51.989> takes<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
particles are so fine it only takes a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
particles are so fine it only takes a
thin<00:00:52.590> coat<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> resin<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> completely<00:00:53.940> adhere

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
thin coat of resin to completely adhere

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.350 
thin coat of resin to completely adhere

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the color to the fabric this makes for

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
the color to the fabric this makes for
the<00:00:57.510> extra<00:00:57.870> soft<00:00:58.109> feel<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.430> natural<00:00:59.640> fall

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the extra soft feel and the natural fall

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
the extra soft feel and the natural fall
