00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
are we going to do once you give us an

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.929 
are we going to do once you give us an
intro<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.699> balance<00:00:29.330> this<00:00:29.510> here<00:00:29.720> problem<00:00:30.939> you

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
intro that balance this here problem you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.810 
intro that balance this here problem you
can<00:00:32.150> feel<00:00:32.510> it<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:32.870> can<00:00:33.080> hear<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:34.220> is

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
can feel it you can hear it it is

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.350 
can feel it you can hear it it is
vibrating<00:00:36.309> we'll<00:00:37.309> test<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:37.699> out<00:00:37.820> with<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.150> piece

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
vibrating we'll test it out with a piece

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.259 
vibrating we'll test it out with a piece
of<00:00:38.570> tape<00:00:38.839> on<00:00:38.989> one<00:00:39.050> side<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.909> sounds<00:00:41.239> like

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
of tape on one side and that sounds like

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.630 
of tape on one side and that sounds like
a<00:00:41.390> severe<00:00:42.019> imbalance<00:00:42.650> problem<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.339> I'll

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
a severe imbalance problem but I'll

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.170 
a severe imbalance problem but I'll
still<00:00:44.210> start<00:00:44.540> with<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:45.370> one<00:00:46.370> inch<00:00:46.549> long<00:00:46.850> piece

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
still start with a one inch long piece

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.149 
still start with a one inch long piece
of<00:00:47.210> tape<00:00:47.540> first<00:00:47.870> we'll<00:00:48.110> find<00:00:48.350> out<00:00:48.559> which<00:00:48.769> bleed

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
of tape first we'll find out which bleed

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.170 
of tape first we'll find out which bleed
it<00:00:49.400> is<00:00:49.580> that<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.150> weak<00:00:50.330> wants<00:00:50.780> -<00:00:50.900> could<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.170> be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.789 

round<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.449> round<00:00:56.629> she<00:00:56.750> goes<00:00:56.869> and<00:00:57.049> where<00:00:57.650> she

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
round and round she goes and where she

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.039 
round and round she goes and where she
stops<00:00:57.979> nobody<00:00:58.430> knows<00:00:58.820> well<00:00:59.540> put<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.780> little

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
stops nobody knows well put a little

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.539 
stops nobody knows well put a little
green<00:01:00.379> dot<00:01:00.739> on<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.549> yellow<00:01:01.850> tip<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:03.549> all

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
green dot on the yellow tip but all

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.750 
green dot on the yellow tip but all
right<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:04.760> this<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.479> starter<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.549> so<00:01:07.549> it

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
right so this is the starter one so it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.740 
right so this is the starter one so it
feels<00:01:08.000> like<00:01:08.359> this<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:13.149> actually<00:01:14.149> worse<00:01:14.450> so

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
feels like this with actually worse so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.990 
feels like this with actually worse so
that<00:01:14.780> might<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.560> blade<00:01:15.850> sounded<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.939> little

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
that might be the blade sounded a little

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.240 
that might be the blade sounded a little
better<00:01:17.299> well<00:01:17.570> let's<00:01:18.049> put<00:01:18.289> a<00:01:18.320> bigger<00:01:18.710> piece<00:01:19.039> of

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
better well let's put a bigger piece of

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.899 
better well let's put a bigger piece of
tape<00:01:19.490> oh<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:21.049> move<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.740> further<00:01:22.039> towards<00:01:22.640> the

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
tape oh and move it further towards the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.649 
tape oh and move it further towards the
tip<00:01:26.679> still<00:01:27.679> vibrating<00:01:28.219> that<00:01:28.909> could<00:01:29.149> mean<00:01:29.359> that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
tip still vibrating that could mean that

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.779 
tip still vibrating that could mean that
we<00:01:29.840> want<00:01:30.020> more<00:01:30.619> tape<00:01:31.009> on<00:01:31.219> there<00:01:31.429> let's<00:01:31.640> try

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
we want more tape on there let's try

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.669 
we want more tape on there let's try
that<00:01:32.030> first<00:01:34.030> nope<00:01:35.030> not<00:01:35.509> doing<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.170> let's

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
that first nope not doing it so let's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.130 
that first nope not doing it so let's
try<00:01:36.890> another<00:01:37.070> blade<00:01:40.630> just<00:01:41.630> remember<00:01:41.990> what

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
try another blade just remember what

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.529 
try another blade just remember what
direction<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.679> go<00:01:42.829> in<00:01:43.149> clockwise<00:01:44.149> or

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
direction you go in clockwise or

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.599 
direction you go in clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:44.960> that's<00:01:45.619> away<00:01:45.859> let's<00:01:46.429> try

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
counterclockwise that's away let's try

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.760 
counterclockwise that's away let's try
this<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:46.999> I<00:01:49.299> think<00:01:50.299> that<00:01:50.450> one's<00:01:50.689> better<00:01:51.049> trial

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
this one I think that one's better trial

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
this one I think that one's better trial
and<00:01:51.859> error<00:01:52.039> trial<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.579> error<00:01:52.729> good<00:01:52.909> ok<00:01:53.420> and

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.200 

so<00:01:59.790> next<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.690> we<00:02:00.870> do<00:02:00.990> clean<00:02:01.440> off<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.890> blades

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
so next thing we do clean off the blades

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
so next thing we do clean off the blades
with<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> piece<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.540> tape<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.320> applying<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
with a piece of tape but applying and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
with a piece of tape but applying and
removing<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.300> tape<00:02:06.510> repeatedly<00:02:07.410> anything

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
removing the tape repeatedly anything

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420 
removing the tape repeatedly anything
that<00:02:08.310> sticks<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.850> tape<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:10.649> come<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:11.130> on

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that sticks to the tape will come off on

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
that sticks to the tape will come off on
the<00:02:12.240> tape<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.930> won't<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.440> blade

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the tape and it won't be on the blade

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.320 
the tape and it won't be on the blade
anymore<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.520> final<00:02:14.910> piece<00:02:15.150> of

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
anymore and then your final piece of

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.480 
anymore and then your final piece of
tape<00:02:15.540> will<00:02:15.720> stick<00:02:15.840> really<00:02:16.200> well<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:17.070> right

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
tape will stick really well all right

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.030 
tape will stick really well all right
well<00:02:17.640> cut<00:02:17.910> our<00:02:18.120> long<00:02:18.450> piece<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.710> blade

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
well cut our long piece for this blade

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
well cut our long piece for this blade
and<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.110> try<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> keep<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.709> hands<00:02:23.010> off

blade revolves at a huge high speed now
in<00:02:35.400> theory<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.480> better<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.959> put<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> blade<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
in theory it's better to put the blade I

because<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.580> theory<00:02:42.150> you'll<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.780> building<00:02:43.260> up

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
because in theory you'll be building up

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.820 
because in theory you'll be building up
your<00:02:44.390> airfoil<00:02:45.390> shape<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.320> tape<00:02:46.560> by

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
your airfoil shape on the tape by

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.940 
your airfoil shape on the tape by
putting<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> front<00:02:47.640> side<00:02:47.970> thereby

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
putting it on the front side thereby

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150 
putting it on the front side thereby
creating<00:02:49.950> more<00:02:50.190> thrust<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:53.040> looks

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
creating more thrust but if it looks

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
creating more thrust but if it looks
better<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> back<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.209> put<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> back

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
better on the back I put it on the back

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.070 
better on the back I put it on the back
and<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.430> goes<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.570> green<00:02:57.780> blade

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and this one goes on the green blade

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.030 
and this one goes on the green blade
which<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.410> right<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:02.480> rub<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.769> good

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
which is right I rub it on really good

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.199 
which is right I rub it on really good
by<00:03:05.459> squeezing<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.480> blade<00:03:07.019> between<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:08.209> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
by squeezing the blade between my it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.690 
by squeezing the blade between my it
rubs<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.810> tape<00:03:10.080> on<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.709> blade<00:03:11.010> alright<00:03:11.549> let's

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
rubs the tape on the blade alright let's

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.470 
rubs the tape on the blade alright let's
test<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.000> again<00:03:14.900> beautiful

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.030 

Wow<00:03:19.510> that's<00:03:20.200> got<00:03:20.470> some<00:03:20.680> hust

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:55.649 

very<00:03:27.040> nice

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.479 

do<00:03:56.659> not<00:03:56.900> stick<00:03:57.260> your<00:03:57.499> finger<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.219> prop

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
do not stick your finger in the prop

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.829 
do not stick your finger in the prop
important<00:03:59.420> safety<00:03:59.599> tip<00:03:59.900> thank<00:04:00.650> you
