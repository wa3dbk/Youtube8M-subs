against Samoa against tomorrow we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.610 
against Samoa against tomorrow we
expected<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.940> tough<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.410> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
expected a tough game because they like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.779 
expected a tough game because they like
to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> through<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> head<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
to be up and through the head and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
to be up and through the head and
absolutely<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.660> knew<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> we

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
absolutely think so we knew that we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
absolutely think so we knew that we
couldn't<00:00:58.530> build<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:59.280> bigger<00:00:59.520> targets<00:01:00.000> which

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
couldn't build two bigger targets which

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
couldn't build two bigger targets which
we<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.230> did<00:01:01.410> fairly<00:01:01.649> well<00:01:01.789> they<00:01:02.789> played

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
we we did fairly well they played

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
we we did fairly well they played
surprisingly<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.260> different<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.339> we

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
surprisingly a different game to what we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.080 
surprisingly a different game to what we
expected<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.530> got<00:01:07.530> away<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> 19-8<00:01:08.700> victory

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
expected so got away with a 19-8 victory

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
expected so got away with a 19-8 victory
which<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.830> paper<00:01:11.040> sounds

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
which you know on paper sounds

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.920 
which you know on paper sounds
comfortable<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> probably<00:01:12.479> wasn't<00:01:12.689> as

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
comfortable but it probably wasn't as

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.679 
comfortable but it probably wasn't as
easy<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.830> looked<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
easy as it looked and then this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
easy as it looked and then this
afternoon<00:01:16.229> against<00:01:17.220> Brunei<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.820> an

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
afternoon against Brunei that was an

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.490 
afternoon against Brunei that was an
extremely<00:01:18.330> tough<00:01:18.630> game<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.200> played

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

fantastic you know we had to really

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
fantastic you know we had to really
battle<00:01:23.820> hard<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.810> through<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.350> but
