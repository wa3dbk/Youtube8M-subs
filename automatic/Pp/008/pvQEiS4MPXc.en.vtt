through<00:06:22.539> brisbane<00:06:23.440> proper<00:06:23.860> so<00:06:23.979> let's<00:06:24.159> go

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
through brisbane proper so let's go

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.620 
through brisbane proper so let's go
ahead<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.550> zoom<00:06:24.669> in<00:06:24.849> very<00:06:24.909> quickly<00:06:25.360> here

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
ahead and zoom in very quickly here

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.300 
ahead and zoom in very quickly here
because<00:06:25.870> i<00:06:25.960> do<00:06:26.020> want<00:06:26.349> to<00:06:26.380> show<00:06:26.590> you<00:06:26.650> a<00:06:26.889> couple

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
of areas one of them in particular right

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.499 
of areas one of them in particular right
along<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.680> Brisbane<00:06:30.099> River<00:06:30.280> here<00:06:30.909> the<00:06:31.180> water

in the afternoon hours we could see this
river<00:06:46.599> rise<00:06:46.960> atop<00:06:47.590> those<00:06:47.919> levels<00:06:48.430> the

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
was that here in 1974 cannot be compared

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:54.990 
was that here in 1974 cannot be compared
to<00:06:53.979> the<00:06:54.099> boom<00:06:54.250> that<00:06:54.430> has<00:06:54.550> happened<00:06:54.909> in
