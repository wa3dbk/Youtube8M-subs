see this what you will see are X's which

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.429 
see this what you will see are X's which
means<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.399> string<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.850> not<00:01:38.030> played<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.229> when

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
means the string is not played so when

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.820 
means the string is not played so when
we<00:01:39.649> strum<00:01:40.189> down<00:01:40.490> again<00:01:41.119> over<00:01:41.750> three<00:01:42.530> or<00:01:42.649> more

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.279 
we strum down again over three or more
notes<00:01:43.100> played<00:01:43.549> at<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.759> same<00:01:43.970> time<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:45.170> to
