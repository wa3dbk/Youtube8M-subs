00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
we're on a spell a tried with the helix

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.220 
we're on a spell a tried with the helix
tell<00:00:19.540> us<00:00:19.630> all<00:00:19.750> about<00:00:19.779> it

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
tell us all about it

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.150 
tell us all about it
yeah<00:00:20.619> this<00:00:21.279> is<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.580> helix<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.830> our<00:00:23.950> best

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
yeah this is the helix one of our best

yeah this is the helix one of our best
freestyle<00:00:24.580> boards<00:00:24.820> in<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.029> line<00:00:25.210> it's<00:00:25.689> an

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
freestyle boards in the line it's an

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.280 
freestyle boards in the line it's an
isometric<00:00:26.230> cord<00:00:26.950> it<00:00:27.070> means<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.970> haircut<00:00:28.689> has

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
isometric cord it means the haircut has

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.400 
isometric cord it means the haircut has
a<00:00:29.369> hasn't<00:00:30.369> different<00:00:30.759> radius<00:00:31.119> at<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.599> S<00:00:32.050> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
a hasn't different radius at the S the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.670 
a hasn't different radius at the S the
front<00:00:32.829> side<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.420> allows<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.110> give

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
front side and so it allows you to give

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.410 
front side and so it allows you to give
you<00:00:35.860> a<00:00:35.890> more<00:00:36.190> fluent<00:00:36.640> feeling<00:00:37.030> if<00:00:37.180> you're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
you a more fluent feeling if you're

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.780 
you a more fluent feeling if you're
going<00:00:38.170> on<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.559> back<00:00:38.739> side<00:00:38.950> because<00:00:39.399> it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
going on the back side because it's

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.880 
going on the back side because it's
following<00:00:40.300> your<00:00:40.480> body<00:00:40.690> structure<00:00:41.140> if<00:00:41.590> you're

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
following your body structure if you're

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.400 
following your body structure if you're
if<00:00:42.610> you're<00:00:43.059> looking<00:00:43.269> at<00:00:43.750> your<00:00:43.870> body<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.379> are

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
if you're looking at your body you are

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.470 
if you're looking at your body you are
more<00:00:44.739> flexible<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.429> the<00:00:45.519> front<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.059> your<00:00:46.239> knees

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
more flexible in the front to your knees

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.569 
more flexible in the front to your knees
into<00:00:46.719> your<00:00:46.960> back<00:00:47.170> but<00:00:47.379> not<00:00:47.620> in<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.399> back

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
into your back but not in the back

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.130 
into your back but not in the back
that's<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.969> problem<00:00:49.239> if<00:00:49.539> you're<00:00:49.780> giving<00:00:50.050> the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
that's the problem if you're giving the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.599 
that's the problem if you're giving the
pressure<00:00:50.410> on<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.739> back<00:00:50.890> side<00:00:51.070> so<00:00:51.129> it<00:00:51.399> makes

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
pressure on the back side so it makes

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.759 
pressure on the back side so it makes
sense<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:52.329> write<00:00:52.539> in<00:00:52.719> different<00:00:53.019> radius<00:00:53.589> on

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
sense to write in different radius on

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.340 
sense to write in different radius on
the<00:00:53.890> backside<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:55.030> gives<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.659> a<00:00:55.899> better

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
the backside and it gives you a better

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.139 
the backside and it gives you a better
feeling<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.920> writing<00:00:57.339> you<00:00:57.489> have<00:00:57.640> more<00:00:57.909> board

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
feeling of writing you have more board

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.259 
feeling of writing you have more board
control<00:00:58.539> it<00:00:58.690> makes<00:00:58.870> more<00:00:59.140> fun<00:00:59.379> if<00:00:59.589> you're

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
control it makes more fun if you're

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.229 
control it makes more fun if you're
going<00:01:01.269> on<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.480> kicker<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.199> you're<00:01:03.239> you're

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
going on a kicker and you're you're

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.790 
going on a kicker and you're you're
starting<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.750> backside<00:01:05.110> turn<00:01:05.379> when<00:01:05.620> you're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
starting a backside turn when you're

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.100 
starting a backside turn when you're
when<00:01:06.280> when<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.120> your<00:01:07.300> take<00:01:07.480> off<00:01:07.659> it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
when when you have your take off it's

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.870 
when when you have your take off it's
much<00:01:08.350> more<00:01:08.590> easier<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.280> give<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.640> board<00:01:09.850> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
much more easier to give the board the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.060 
much more easier to give the board the
right<00:01:10.150> spin<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.750> makes<00:01:11.020> makes<00:01:11.800> your

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
right spin and it makes makes your

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.240 
right spin and it makes makes your
writing<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.640> very<00:01:12.909> better<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:14.290> kind<00:01:15.100> of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
writing a very better and this kind of

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.950 
writing a very better and this kind of
Port<00:01:15.670> building<00:01:16.150> with<00:01:16.270> an<00:01:16.420> asymmetrical

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
Port building with an asymmetrical

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.690 
Port building with an asymmetrical
sidecut<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:17.800> for<00:01:18.010> sure<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.310> right<00:01:18.460> way<00:01:18.640> to

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
sidecut it's for sure the right way to

build a snow books why isn't everybody

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.410 
build a snow books why isn't everybody
doing<00:01:20.410> this<00:01:20.740> we<00:01:21.160> are<00:01:21.250> happy<00:01:21.490> about<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.880> some<00:01:22.390> of

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
doing this we are happy about it some of

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.500 
doing this we are happy about it some of
them<00:01:22.690> are<00:01:22.930> doing<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.350> but<00:01:24.010> I<00:01:24.460> cannot<00:01:25.180> tell<00:01:25.450> you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
them are doing it but I cannot tell you

them are doing it but I cannot tell you
but<00:01:25.870> we<00:01:26.050> are<00:01:26.140> thinking<00:01:26.620> that<00:01:26.680> this<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.400> the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
but we are thinking that this is the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.980 
but we are thinking that this is the
best<00:01:27.700> way<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:27.940> build<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.390> snow<00:01:28.630> board<00:01:28.810> and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
best way to build a snow board and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.600 
best way to build a snow board and
making<00:01:29.230> you<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> better<00:01:29.740> snowboarder

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
making you a better snowboarder

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.760 
making you a better snowboarder
we<00:01:30.880> developed<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.810> tested<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:32.350> with<00:01:32.530> our

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
we developed it and tested it with our

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.540 
we developed it and tested it with our
team<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.420> tests<00:01:35.260> are<00:01:35.470> saying<00:01:35.980> that<00:01:36.310> this<00:01:36.490> is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
team that tests are saying that this is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.970 
team that tests are saying that this is
the<00:01:37.060> better<00:01:37.300> way<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:38.080> build<00:01:38.260> a<00:01:38.440> snowboard<00:01:38.890> you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
the better way to build a snowboard you

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.350 
the better way to build a snowboard you
don't<00:01:39.220> recognize<00:01:39.730> it<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.180> have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
don't recognize it that you have

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.390 
don't recognize it that you have
indifferent<00:01:40.900> inside<00:01:41.230> radius<00:01:41.410> but<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:42.250> you're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
indifferent inside radius but if you're

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.220 
indifferent inside radius but if you're
writing<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.910> you're<00:01:43.150> you're<00:01:43.570> recognizing

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
writing it you're you're recognizing

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.860 
writing it you're you're recognizing
that<00:01:44.380> your<00:01:44.760> body<00:01:45.760> movement<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.420> everything

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
that your body movement and everything

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.710 
that your body movement and everything
is<00:01:47.290> more<00:01:47.590> fluent<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.310> better<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.300> edges

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
is more fluent and better and your edges

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240 
is more fluent and better and your edges
better<00:01:49.960> on<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> snow<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.770> you're<00:01:50.890> getting

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
better on the snow and you're getting

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.370 
better on the snow and you're getting
your<00:01:51.430> power<00:01:51.760> better<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.360> backside<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.900> it

your power better on the backside and it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.640 
your power better on the backside and it
gives<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.800> just<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.340> better<00:01:55.210> better<00:01:56.200> feeling
