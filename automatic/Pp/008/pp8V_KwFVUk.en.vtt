00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
they're dealing with is muscle spasm

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
they're dealing with is muscle spasm
and<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> explain<00:01:21.150> muscle<00:01:21.450> spasm<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and the way I explain muscle spasm it is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
and the way I explain muscle spasm it is
it's<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.369> body<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.880> trying<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's your body actually trying to do a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's your body actually trying to do a
good<00:01:24.869> thing<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.189> doing<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> bad

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
good thing but it's kind of doing a bad

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
good thing but it's kind of doing a bad
thing<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> mean<00:01:27.600> by<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.110> muscle

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
thing and what I mean by that is muscle

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.649 
thing and what I mean by that is muscle
spasm<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> defense<00:01:29.820> mechanism<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
spasm is a defense mechanism of your

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.010 
spasm is a defense mechanism of your
body

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
body

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
body
I<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.619> explain<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> people<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.460> muscles

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I was explain to people that muscles

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.050 
I was explain to people that muscles
their<00:01:33.540> job<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> body<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> specifically

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
their job in the body and specifically

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
their job in the body and specifically
in<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> spine<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.290> support<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> spine<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
in the spine is to support the spine and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.880 
in the spine is to support the spine and
protected<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.689> muscles<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.619> hold

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
protected your muscles are what hold

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
protected your muscles are what hold
your<00:01:41.040> spine<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.729> stabilize<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.630> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
your spine up and stabilize it and so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.830 
your spine up and stabilize it and so
muscles<00:01:44.280> family<00:01:44.640> has<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:44.970> underlying<00:01:45.420> cause

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
muscles family has an underlying cause

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.889 
muscles family has an underlying cause
and<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> mean<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.399> usually<00:01:48.090> what

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and what I mean by that is usually what

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
and what I mean by that is usually what
will<00:01:49.020> happen<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.100> facet<00:01:50.490> joint<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
will happen is the facet joint in the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.270 
will happen is the facet joint in the
spine<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> hinge<00:01:52.740> joints<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
spine which are the hinge joints in the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609 
spine which are the hinge joints in the
spine<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> nerve<00:01:54.840> root<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> nerve

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
spine or the nerve root or the nerve

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.190 
spine or the nerve root or the nerve
roots<00:01:55.829> exit<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.399> spine<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.689> maybe<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
roots exit out the spine or maybe in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
roots exit out the spine or maybe in the
disk<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.040> injured<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.329> of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
disk could be injured but in one of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.319 
disk could be injured but in one of
those<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.710> three<00:02:02.009> areas<00:02:02.399> there's

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
those but you know three areas there's

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
those but you know three areas there's
inflammation<00:02:03.750> there's<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.439> problem<00:02:04.740> there's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
inflammation there's a problem there's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.069 
inflammation there's a problem there's
something<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> muscle

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
something going on and so the muscle

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.609 
something going on and so the muscle
reads<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.330> problem<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.500> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
reads that as a problem and so it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.270 
reads that as a problem and so it
literally

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
literally

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.030 
literally
eases<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.670> or<00:02:11.880> spasms<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:13.110> protect<00:02:13.920> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
eases up or spasms up to protect that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.430 
eases up or spasms up to protect that
area<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.630> patient<00:02:16.020> comes<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.350> my

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
area so when that patient comes in my

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.070 
area so when that patient comes in my
office<00:02:16.740> again<00:02:17.010> they're<00:02:17.370> usually<00:02:17.520> having

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
office again they're usually having

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.570 
office again they're usually having
they're<00:02:19.080> having<00:02:19.319> some<00:02:19.440> nerve<00:02:19.620> compression<00:02:19.860> or

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
they're having some nerve compression or

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.059 
they're having some nerve compression or
they're<00:02:21.060> having<00:02:21.180> joint<00:02:21.810> inflammation<00:02:22.110> or

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
they're having joint inflammation or

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.470 
they're having joint inflammation or
maybe<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:23.850> bit<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.270> disk

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
maybe they have a little bit of disk

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.820 
maybe they have a little bit of disk
injury<00:02:24.720> which<00:02:25.140> could<00:02:25.319> be<00:02:25.380> putting<00:02:25.620> pressure

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
injury which could be putting pressure

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.059 
injury which could be putting pressure
on<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.160> nerve<00:02:26.780> but<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.930> problem<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.500> causing

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
on the nerve but that problem is causing

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.360 
on the nerve but that problem is causing
the<00:02:29.790> muscle<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.209> spasm<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the muscle of spasm up you know as a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
the muscle of spasm up you know as a
defensive<00:02:32.970> mechanism<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.260> muscle<00:02:34.620> goes<00:02:34.800> into

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
defensive mechanism the muscle goes into

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.340 
defensive mechanism the muscle goes into
protective<00:02:35.520> mode<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.300> spasm<00:02:36.810> muscle<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
protective mode and this spasm muscle is

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.750 
protective mode and this spasm muscle is
what's<00:02:37.590> causing<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.250> much<00:02:38.400> pain<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
what's causing so much pain and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.870 
what's causing so much pain and
inability<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.810> move<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.830> usually<00:02:41.160> when<00:02:41.760> you're

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
inability to move so usually when you're

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.460 
inability to move so usually when you're
having<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.330> severe<00:02:42.720> pain<00:02:42.989> that's<00:02:43.170> usually

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
having that severe pain that's usually

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.680 
having that severe pain that's usually
due<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.709> muscle<00:02:43.920> spasm<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
due to muscle spasm you know and that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.020 
due to muscle spasm you know and that
patient<00:02:46.019> will<00:02:46.140> often<00:02:46.410> say<00:02:46.620> oh<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:48.000> just
