00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810

attempt<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> anymore<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
attempt to do that anymore but the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.130 
attempt to do that anymore but the
reason<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.570> bedroom<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.960> now

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
reason that I'm in my bedroom right now

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.490 
reason that I'm in my bedroom right now
is<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.309> tried<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.390> last<00:00:33.899> night<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is because I tried all last night and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.119 
is because I tried all last night and
all<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.790> today<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.210> far<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.920> live

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
all of today so far to get that live

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
all of today so far to get that live
stream<00:00:38.520> video<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.270> four<00:00:39.510> hours<00:00:39.540> long<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
stream video up it's four hours long and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.459 
stream video up it's four hours long and
it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.770> taking<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.780> crazy<00:00:43.200> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it is taking so long it's crazy it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
it is taking so long it's crazy it's
still<00:00:43.680> processing<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.520> I'm<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.789> hoping

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
still processing and I'm just hoping

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
still processing and I'm just hoping
that<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.719> time<00:00:45.780> hoping<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.860> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that it works this time hoping that this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
that it works this time hoping that this
is<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> end<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> works<00:00:48.660> after<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
is the end that it works after this but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.260 
is the end that it works after this but
I<00:00:50.370> figured<00:00:50.910> rather<00:00:51.210> than<00:00:52.610> confuse<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I figured rather than confuse the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
I figured rather than confuse the
internet<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.649> by<00:00:56.340> trying<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> upload

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
internet that's here by trying to upload

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
internet that's here by trying to upload
another<00:00:57.090> video<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.289> wouldn't

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
another video on there i just wouldn't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
another video on there i just wouldn't
tempt<00:00:59.010> fate<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.640> would<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.850> upload<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
tempt fate and I would just upload a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
tempt fate and I would just upload a
video<00:01:00.449> through<00:01:00.780> my<00:01:00.989> phone<00:01:01.199> internet<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.829> think

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
video through my phone internet I think

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
video through my phone internet I think
that<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.579> easier<00:01:02.879> even<00:01:03.180> though

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that that's a bit easier even though

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050 
that that's a bit easier even though
this<00:01:03.539> video<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.470> grey<00:01:04.760> it's<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.880> video
