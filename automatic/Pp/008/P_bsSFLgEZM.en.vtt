00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.310
 but would be very high 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.880
 but we have a great mood in the 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.820
 moment that we all fit together well 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.160
 and we are all very successful so 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 last year in the speed disciplines 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.500
 we were all on the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 protest and won almost all that was 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 really amazing 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.040
 and yes, that's great at the moment 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 and I think that we stay because 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.030
 that it's the new times and we have 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 I really would be a one team 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.820
 think 44 44 years as well as the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 support everyone and we are very 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.729
 happy if the other on the protests 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 be a great result so have the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.810
 is really great because it did not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 always so happens and the support 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 of all certainly there yes I am one 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 hard worker 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 but i am also i like tall shoes 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.570
 and clothes and yes I am very 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.110
 Female and since you do not see so often 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:05.640
 when running but that's the other one 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:11.610
 page could not explain that like him 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.310
 is because always other school and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 he laughs now more than probably yes I have 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.600
 really no idea who he is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.670
 be fast in solln be for the races 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:30.880
 because i have with nobody i lose 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.360
 was only alone in July 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.690
 training and I have a few runs of 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.940
 the other - looked but no idea 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.850
 and you can if you can not say that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.320
 that does not matter if you, you know who 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.710
 It's quick to witness because of the training 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.040
 is another race and that is always 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.030
 a surprise who wins here has 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.030
