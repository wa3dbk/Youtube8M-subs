drills that elicit muscle stretch reflex
or<00:00:50.059> help<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:50.949> get<00:00:51.949> your<00:00:52.129> muscles<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.610> respond

or help you get your muscles to respond
faster<00:00:53.390> more<00:00:53.899> explosively<00:00:54.469> than<00:00:54.710> they

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
faster more explosively than they

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.799 
faster more explosively than they
normally<00:00:54.980> would<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.180> case<00:00:56.449> we're<00:00:56.660> going

normally would in this case we're going

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.349 
normally would in this case we're going
to<00:00:56.899> do<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.020> jump<00:00:57.320> rope<00:00:57.500> first<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.670> like<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.059> go<00:00:59.210> in

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
to do a jump rope first we like to go in

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.250 
to do a jump rope first we like to go in
very<00:00:59.629> short<00:00:59.899> segments<00:01:01.480> 15<00:01:02.480> seconds<00:01:02.960> or<00:01:03.050> less

very short segments 15 seconds or less
generally<00:01:03.829> we<00:01:03.949> go<00:01:04.070> around<00:01:04.160> 10<00:01:04.550> seconds<00:01:05.149> that

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
generally we go around 10 seconds that

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.609 
generally we go around 10 seconds that
way<00:01:05.509> we're<00:01:05.720> working<00:01:06.050> on<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.229> right<00:01:06.350> energy

another<00:01:30.549> plyometric<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.360> did<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.570> low-impact

plyometric is a Dow jumped in this case

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.139 
plyometric is a Dow jumped in this case
it<00:01:34.539> took<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:35.079> one<00:01:35.590> inch<00:01:35.770> wooden<00:01:36.069> dowel<00:01:36.369> cut<00:01:37.060> it

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
it took a one inch wooden dowel cut it

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.270 
it took a one inch wooden dowel cut it
down<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.450> middle<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.929> it's<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.079> half<00:01:38.289> inch<00:01:38.590> we

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
down the middle so it's a half inch we

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.219 
down the middle so it's a half inch we
simply<00:01:39.819> want<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.119> do<00:01:40.299> this<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:40.840> force

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
simply want to do this so we force

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.990 
simply want to do this so we force
Jeremy<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.799> hit<00:01:41.950> his<00:01:42.100> feet<00:01:42.369> off<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.610> ground

ground hit the ground explosively with
his<00:01:47.950> feet<00:01:48.189> but<00:01:48.369> also<00:01:48.490> be<00:01:48.880> on<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.090> ground<00:01:49.270> very

short period go do a lateral Dow jump
when<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.349> do<00:01:53.560> this<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:53.979> do<00:01:54.130> eight<00:01:54.340> seconds

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
when we do this we do eight seconds

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.410 
when we do this we do eight seconds
intervals<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:57.459> Jeremy's<00:01:57.909> case<00:01:58.119> he's

intervals and in Jeremy's case he's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.339 
intervals and in Jeremy's case he's
getting<00:01:58.689> thirty<00:01:58.929> six<00:01:59.289> reps<00:02:00.899> hop<00:02:01.899> which<00:02:02.200> is

getting thirty six reps hop which is

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.559 
getting thirty six reps hop which is
really<00:02:02.649> very<00:02:02.890> fast<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:03.909> can't<00:02:04.209> do<00:02:04.390> that

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
really very fast and you can't do that

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.300 
really very fast and you can't do that
unless<00:02:04.750> he<00:02:04.840> has<00:02:05.020> very<00:02:05.229> good<00:02:05.349> control<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:06.159> if

explosive movement in this case we call
these<00:02:24.370> switching<00:02:24.850> goes<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.720> we'll<00:02:25.900> switch<00:02:26.020> we

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
these switching goes so we'll switch we

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.220

drum and then switch back maybe to
lateral<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.590> then<00:02:32.680> we'll<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.040> them<00:02:33.190> say

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
lateral and then we'll have them say

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.070 
lateral and then we'll have them say
we'll<00:02:33.670> give<00:02:33.790> them<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.910> cube<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.450> don't<00:02:35.020> go

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
we'll give them a cube go don't go

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.620 
we'll give them a cube go don't go
they'll<00:02:35.620> go<00:02:35.770> crossed<00:02:36.160> one<00:02:36.790> down<00:02:37.030> over<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.540> the

they'll go crossed one down over to the

they'll go crossed one down over to the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
vertical loop and what we're looking for

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.710 
vertical loop and what we're looking for
is<00:03:26.010> very<00:03:26.310> explosive<00:03:26.730> movements<00:03:27.420> both

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
directions and wanting to do it as

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.740 
directions and wanting to do it as
quickly<00:03:30.990> as<00:03:31.260> possible<00:03:31.370> but<00:03:32.370> also<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.910> high<00:03:33.240> on

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
quickly as possible but also is high on

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
quickly as possible but also is high on
the<00:03:33.930> vertical<00:03:34.230> jump<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:34.680> possible<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.400> is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the vertical jump as possible and is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.420 
the vertical jump as possible and is
long<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:37.080> lateral<00:03:37.440> runners<00:03:37.770> possible<00:03:38.310> so

we're<00:03:38.580> looking<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:38.970> efficient<00:03:39.450> movement

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
we're looking for efficient movement

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.860 
we're looking for efficient movement
which<00:03:40.530> incorporates<00:03:41.250> strength<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.360> speed

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
which incorporates strength and speed

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.090 
which incorporates strength and speed
okay

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
okay

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.160 
okay
so<00:03:44.520> in<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.790> case<00:03:45.030> we're<00:03:45.300> going<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.480> use<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> 40

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so in this case we're going to use a 40

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.100 
so in this case we're going to use a 40

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
routinely in the offseason he can get

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.750 
routinely in the offseason he can get
significantly<00:03:58.590> higher<00:03:58.890> than<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.610> is

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
significantly higher than this which is

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.850 
significantly higher than this which is
really<00:04:00.060> impressive<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.350> watch<00:04:01.590> him

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
really impressive when you watch him

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.540 
really impressive when you watch him
you'll<00:04:02.010> see<00:04:02.190> again<00:04:02.430> break<00:04:02.790> Trump<00:04:03.150> stability
