00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello tankers with you houses 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 Apparently obviously one of you wants me to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 forgot how to fight in random and whole 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.540
 spent days instead riding alone 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 empty server 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 okay, I can't refuse you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.949
 I understand that everyone is waiting for updates and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 anticipating new tanks and once again 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 I will remind you that after the release of the update 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.849
 1 and 11 I will re-do vidos by 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
 all this tank when you can already 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.730
 run in battles and lay in your head 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.309
 some final picture of the tank 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 will be a well 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.930
 Today, with one eye, look at 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 Soviet medium tank seventh either 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 lacquer 13 this damn dozen first 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.329
 his turn is interesting because his 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 location in the research tree 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.680
 combines two branches 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.770
 betka tyazhe to IS-7 and st step to t-62a then 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 if there is heavy deflating 1c 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.920
 want to go ps more then 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.439
 explore kv-13 deflate it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 and voila you had to ride tanks 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.600
 from 2 to 6 lvl in the next branch 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 This feature is due to the fact that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 KV-13 in real life was designed 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 as a replacement for tank and to in and thirty 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 the fourth, that is, on paper, the tank should 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.380
 was to have a heavy tank reservation and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.229
 average mobility 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.259
 but when built prototypes then 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.020
 things went right off bad tank broke 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.509
 very and very often and can even lead 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.780
 such quotes designer turtles anyone 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.149
 most of all I remember this tank 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.680
 so that he broke down every day as 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 just left the factory 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 some workers even argued on 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.899
 a piece of sugar will break the damn 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.149
 dozen behind the gate of the plant or will have time 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.640
 return from the landfill remember how one 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.790
 elderly worker sneak baptized 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.899
 outgoing tank but nothing helped it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.659
 broke again 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.819
 as not difficult to guess the project turned 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.420
 and returned to the release of kb tanks and 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.670
 thirty fourth but all developments were 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.610
 used 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.780
 the creation of the legendary heavy tank 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.300
 Joseph Stalin 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.569
 looking at apt-13 in principle it is understandable 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.000
 they are very similar and have even 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.280
 same booking and its corners 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.980
 tilt that's just turned out 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.980
 the consequence is much more and lost in 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.260
 mobility but back in blitz since 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.120
 us tank can't break from it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 exploited but at least with me 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.590
 have never been able to do that 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.959
 we have a conceived car with armor 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.790
 heavy tank mobility and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.060
 armament from medium 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.180
 on let's look at tth very 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.980
 interested in this tank to be honest 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.370
 booking is much higher than all 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 classmates for the above reasons 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.330
 minimum reduced armor in the forehead 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.489
 is 108 millimeters in the cheeks 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.880
 towers when in the hull even the bottom 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.519
 the frontal part has been cast to 124 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.640
 but not in millimeters this car pulls 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.430
 even the strikes 6 break through such a thickness 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.390
 leveled off if properly vented all 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.400
 the thing is exactly gorgeous tilt angles 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.519
 ricochet this armor in the forehead constantly 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.750
 fighting off shells even wrote 9 levla when 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.450
 proper luck 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.459
 in general, all have already met a hundred times 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.549
 usual 1 of a in battles 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.980
 honestly everything is absolutely the same and you know 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.570
 as he tanks we go further what 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.450
 concerns mobility 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.760
 KV-13 is clearly on 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.760
 last place but with a little 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.000
 maximum speed lag 50 kilometers 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.640
 hour power density of almost 17 ponyashek 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.459
 per ton and turning in 40 degrees 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.430
 a second so that you could clearly understand 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.590
 more clearly understand how strong you are 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.799
 inferior to his colleagues made for you 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.079
 such q fat wounds are generally more or less 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.930
 there is only big difference 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.970
 agility but still 40 is the same 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.150
 I can not name a decent figure 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.299
 its bad especially since the tower spins 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.459
 with a speed of 48 problems with targeting 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.280
 maneuverable opponents even on very 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.440
 close range will not be if anyone 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.940
 I wonder how much different 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.580
 mobility from out 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.970
 but because the hull is still very similar 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.820
 here's a comparison for you 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.130
 KV-13 is quite a mobile tank which 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.070
 can break into the forefront or 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.250
 quickly dump further as for 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.420
 guns then this is the same gun as u 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.420
 neighbor t-43 and that means big alpha 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:53.650
 200 average accuracy and small 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.740
 breaking left for 7 la 144 but since 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.830
 kv-13 need to balance he was taken away 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.440
 h1 rate of rounds per minute and 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.390
 so dad there salki he does not divide 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.090
 second place with your neighbor 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.900
 and ranked fourth anyway 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.630
 panther and t20 but that's what's the worst thing 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.750
 cannon to 12 so this is the declination angle iii 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.490
 just five down so on the hilly 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.750
 cards will have to exhibit your 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.910
 armored hull 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.340
 it is more or less even such 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.820
 canal well or city metal boogie to you 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.200
 will feel chic and so 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.020
 we have in the end 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.419
 and we have a medium tank that can 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.050
 behave in combat as hard but not 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.530
 altogether 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.070
 Alpha Isav 400 is not enough yet for 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.560
 of this 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.050
 Well, you know in my opinion in the face 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.930
 repeats the same story as in 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.950
 real life on paper 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.190
 in my words 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.730
 tth tank but in general everything is fine and 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.430
 mia brand will prove that the armor is not so 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.520
 and mobility is needed yet not so much 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.140
 good slopes are port impressions 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.050
 tanks and stuff 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.620
 some small cons can do 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.770
 the tank is not very comfortable but it will show 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.340
 only random after update 1 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.010
 and 11 she is already very, very soon now 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.600
 we can only wait 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.360
 I will not draw further conclusions 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.230
 because there is no full picture yet 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.770
 this tank and so i have today 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.350
 everything 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.320
 like this video if you want 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.849
 so that I am already back in random and I could 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.219
 will continue to do reviews already on 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.279
 dunes and tanks and the top damn already unlearn 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:41.419
 fight at this rate the sand germans and 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.659
 Sherman Jumbo 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.689
 I will have to update only after well 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:53.979
 and with you and for you as always there was a half 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:53.979
 see you soon tankers me
