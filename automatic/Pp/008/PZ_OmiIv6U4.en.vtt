00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.930
 the profession of future king has many 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.520
 easements 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.010
 to begin by delivering speeches 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.930
 to squeeze soft hands or me you are 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.160
 stayed standing for hours trying all 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.440
 the whims of the weather 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.970
 but when we put the Prince of Wales and 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.400
 future chief of the commonwealth 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.990
 the task becomes downright harsh because it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.910
 is not to displease all 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.700
 diverse populations of a vast empire 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.039
 after learning to greet with the nose 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.719
 in the Maori way to climb in a 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.780
 dugout with the aborigines of australia 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.360
 worn loincloth of remote tribes 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 from Africa even covering himself the head of a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 cowboy hat or feathers 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 of Indian women according to the circumstances 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.230
 prince charles found himself a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 new disguise that changes it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.239
 singularly from his Scottish kilt to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.470
 the less we can not blame him for his 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 lack of involvement 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 during his second official trip in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 Saudi Arabia with two of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.399
 two brothers of king abdallah of good 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.770
 grace 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 visiting ryad the British heir 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.119
 introduced to traditional dance 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 of the arda at the annual festival of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.530
 jenadriya wearing the dress and the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.289
 red and white checkered keffiyeh 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.049
 saudi a golden dagger at the waist 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.119
 surrounded by co2 princely heir of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.829
 throne of england aged 65 years must 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.929
 remember is that they were undertaking alone 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.420
 without a camille to his official trip in 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.409
 Saudi Arabia and Qatar attempted to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.959
 keep pace 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.539
 improvising a saraband brandishing 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.999
 a sword to the beat of drums as well 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.159
 disguised half way between tintin in the country 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.560
 of black gold and lawrence of arabia the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.689
 Prince of Wales seemed to be wondering 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.909
 his heart if the contracts 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.920
 key economic reasons justified a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.420
 such posture as the tabloids 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.999
 British did not hesitate to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.189
 qualify as laughable and pathetic 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.590
 should it be condemned as 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.990
 hard what would not we do for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 strengthen economic links with 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.340
 allied countries if not lend themselves without 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.409
 reluctant to local customs and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.929
 slip without flinching in the suit 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.579
 honor of a blood brother 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.799
 for sure, a minister of industry 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.929
 or rigid foreign trade in 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.910
 suit and tie applauding from the last 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 fingers the dance of the arda would have had 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 less successful at the end of the day than 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.340
 Heir weathered by time and chiselled 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.830
 experience 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.379
 various having such consciousness of its 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.690
 role and such a love of his country that he 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.590
 can afford to dance is above 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.590
 of all the ridiculous
