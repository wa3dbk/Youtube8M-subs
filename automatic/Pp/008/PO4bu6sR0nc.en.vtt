this thing is pretty amazing but let's
first<00:00:36.120> talk<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.079> specs<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> said

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
first talk about the specs so as I said

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.380 
first talk about the specs so as I said
it's<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.149> 27<00:00:39.750> inch<00:00:39.840> display<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> 16<00:00:42.059> by<00:00:42.360> 9

as<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.620> said<00:00:52.890> 2560<00:00:53.730> by<00:00:53.910> 1440<00:00:54.360> which<00:00:54.840> means

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
as I just said 2560 by 1440 which means

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
as I just said 2560 by 1440 which means
1440p<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.789> 60<00:00:57.420> Hertz<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:58.579> contrast

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
1440p and that's at 60 Hertz a contrast

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
1440p and that's at 60 Hertz a contrast
ratio<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> thousand<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> one

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
and the silver is a bit more shiny I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.410 
and the silver is a bit more shiny I
don't<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:47.909> has<00:01:48.180> quite<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
don't know it just has quite a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
don't know it just has quite a
professional<00:01:49.049> look<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.829> think

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
professional look to me I don't think

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
professional look to me I don't think
it's<00:01:50.100> bad<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> still<00:01:50.939> looks<00:01:51.119> pretty

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's bad I think it still looks pretty

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.149 
it's bad I think it still looks pretty
good<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> definitely<00:01:52.259> seems<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.740> quite

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
good but it definitely seems like quite

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.060 
good but it definitely seems like quite
a<00:01:53.189> professional<00:01:54.090> looking<00:01:54.990> monitor<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
a professional looking monitor and that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
a professional looking monitor and that
sense<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.689> features<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.229> one

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
sense now it features that one

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
sense now it features that one

top but before you get too ahead of
yourself<00:02:03.240> you'll<00:02:03.659> notice<00:02:04.049> there's<00:02:04.229> also<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
millimeters total that still is quite

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.069 
millimeters total that still is quite
small<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:19.879> it's<00:02:20.180> definitely<00:02:20.510> not<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.659> bad<00:02:20.870> thing

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
small so it's definitely not a bad thing

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.390 
small so it's definitely not a bad thing
that's<00:02:21.319> going<00:02:21.439> to<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.650> awesome<00:02:21.799> for<00:02:21.980> putting

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
that's going to be awesome for putting

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.649 
that's going to be awesome for putting
two<00:02:22.549> of<00:02:22.670> these<00:02:22.760> together<00:02:22.969> you<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> real

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
two of these together you have a real

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.289 
two of these together you have a real
seamless<00:02:24.230> display<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> still<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.090> like

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
seamless display so I still really like

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.080 
seamless display so I still really like
that<00:02:26.659> however<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.560> not<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.099> one<00:02:28.489> millimeter

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
that however it's not the one millimeter

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.179 
that however it's not the one millimeter
that<00:02:29.870> some<00:02:30.140> people<00:02:30.349> seem<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.709> ahead<00:02:31.040> of

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
that some people seem to get ahead of

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.710 
that some people seem to get ahead of
themselves<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.700> think<00:02:31.909> it<00:02:32.030> truly<00:02:32.239> as<00:02:32.510> this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
themselves and think it truly as this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.869 
themselves and think it truly as this
display<00:02:33.079> doesn't<00:02:33.319> go<00:02:33.530> all<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.799> way<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
display doesn't go all the way to the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:35.940 
display doesn't go all the way to the
edge

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
edge

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.270 
edge
now<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.010> stand<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.879> absolutely<00:02:38.689> fantastic<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
now the stand is absolutely fantastic so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.300 
now the stand is absolutely fantastic so
it<00:02:40.579> supports<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.450> wide<00:02:41.480> range<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.409> tilt<00:02:42.920> which

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
it supports a wide range of tilt which

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.610 
it supports a wide range of tilt which
is<00:02:43.489> really<00:02:44.000> nice<00:02:44.180> see<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.689> heap<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.439> height

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
is really nice see a heap of height

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.199 
is really nice see a heap of height
adjustment<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> lot<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.700> people<00:02:46.939> are<00:02:47.030> really

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
adjustment so a lot of people are really

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.089 
adjustment so a lot of people are really
going<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.540> like<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.079> really<00:02:48.379> handy<00:02:48.859> tab

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
going to like that it's really handy tab

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.640 
going to like that it's really handy tab
so<00:02:49.639> he<00:02:49.849> provided<00:02:50.239> just<00:02:50.540> meant<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.930> good<00:02:51.319> amount

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
so he provided just meant a good amount

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.580 
so he provided just meant a good amount
of<00:02:51.739> swivel<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:53.299> rotation<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.169> it<00:02:54.260> does<00:02:54.409> all

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
of swivel and a rotation and it does all

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.409 
of swivel and a rotation and it does all
this<00:02:54.739> very<00:02:55.069> smoothly<00:02:55.489> can<00:02:55.879> be<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> tiny<00:02:56.269> bit

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.419 
this very smoothly can be a tiny bit

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.960 
this very smoothly can be a tiny bit
stiff<00:02:56.810> at<00:02:56.930> times<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:58.159> for<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.430> most<00:02:58.609> but<00:02:58.849> it

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
stiff at times but for the most but it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.589 
stiff at times but for the most but it
does<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> really<00:02:59.510> good<00:02:59.780> job<00:02:59.840> in<00:03:00.379> terms<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.859> its

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
does a really good job in terms of its

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.089 
does a really good job in terms of its
stand<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.079> also<00:03:03.230> supports<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.889> visa

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
stand and it also supports a visa

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.920 
stand and it also supports a visa
mounting<00:03:04.639> as<00:03:04.760> well<00:03:04.939> which<00:03:05.180> some<00:03:05.540> people<00:03:05.840> out

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
mounting as well which some people out

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.009 
mounting as well which some people out
there<00:03:06.200> will<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:06.709> as<00:03:07.579> far<00:03:07.819> as<00:03:07.879> AO<00:03:08.180> goes<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
there will like as far as AO goes it's a

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.330 
there will like as far as AO goes it's a
bit<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.379> mixed<00:03:09.650> bag<00:03:09.829> but<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.099> gives<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
bit of a mixed bag but it gives you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.770 
bit of a mixed bag but it gives you
plenty<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.939> that's<00:03:11.150> quite<00:03:11.510> good

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
plenty so that's quite good

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.500 
plenty so that's quite good
so<00:03:12.139> it<00:03:12.260> comes<00:03:12.379> with<00:03:12.500> two<00:03:12.859> HDMI<00:03:13.400> ports<00:03:13.939> a<00:03:14.090> single

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so it comes with two HDMI ports a single

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.349 
so it comes with two HDMI ports a single
DisplayPort<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.439> single<00:03:16.159> mini<00:03:16.489> DisplayPort<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
DisplayPort a single mini DisplayPort a

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.309 
DisplayPort a single mini DisplayPort a
DisplayPort<00:03:18.109> out<00:03:18.790> audio<00:03:19.790> output<00:03:20.269> USB<00:03:20.599> up<00:03:21.079> and

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
DisplayPort out audio output USB up and

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.089 
DisplayPort out audio output USB up and
four<00:03:21.949> USB<00:03:22.519> 3.0<00:03:23.479> ports<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.019> really<00:03:24.680> good<00:03:24.949> you

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
four USB 3.0 ports so really good you

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.680 
four USB 3.0 ports so really good you
know<00:03:25.129> quite<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.400> bit<00:03:25.489> there<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.449> think

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
know quite a bit there so I think

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.229 
know quite a bit there so I think
that'll<00:03:26.959> please<00:03:27.109> most<00:03:27.500> people<00:03:27.889> I<00:03:28.180> think<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
that'll please most people I think the

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.000 
that'll please most people I think the
majority<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.019> out<00:03:30.199> there<00:03:30.409> will<00:03:30.709> be<00:03:30.739> just

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
majority of you out there will be just

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.189 
majority of you out there will be just
be<00:03:31.129> using<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.699> DisplayPort<00:03:32.449> but<00:03:32.750> some<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.109> you

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
be using the DisplayPort but some of you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.460 
be using the DisplayPort but some of you
might<00:03:33.349> be<00:03:33.379> using<00:03:33.709> HDMI<00:03:34.280> as<00:03:34.669> well<00:03:34.909> and<00:03:35.810> as<00:03:36.440> far

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
might be using HDMI as well and as far

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.819 
might be using HDMI as well and as far
as<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.010> menu<00:03:37.220> goes<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.849> was<00:03:38.120> pretty<00:03:38.959> solid<00:03:39.260> the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
as the menu goes I was pretty solid the

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.219 
as the menu goes I was pretty solid the
buttons<00:03:40.669> can<00:03:41.269> be<00:03:41.359> a<00:03:41.389> little<00:03:41.629> bit<00:03:41.810> fiddly<00:03:42.199> to

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
buttons can be a little bit fiddly to

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.110 
buttons can be a little bit fiddly to
get<00:03:42.530> used<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.799> at<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.250> starts<00:03:43.760> because

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
get used to at the starts because

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.759 
get used to at the starts because
they're<00:03:44.239> not<00:03:44.359> really<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.720> physical<00:03:45.079> button<00:03:45.650> in

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
they're not really a physical button in

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.339 
they're not really a physical button in
the<00:03:45.919> sense<00:03:46.159> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.370> word<00:03:46.579> however<00:03:47.419> it's<00:03:48.199> still

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
the sense of the word however it's still

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.530 
the sense of the word however it's still
pretty<00:03:48.769> good<00:03:48.979> and<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.579> shows<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.970> energy<00:03:50.329> use

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
pretty good and it shows the energy use

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.300 
pretty good and it shows the energy use
which<00:03:50.780> was<00:03:50.989> quite<00:03:51.199> a<00:03:51.260> cool<00:03:51.470> thing<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.859> don't

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
which was quite a cool thing I don't

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.990 
which was quite a cool thing I don't
think<00:03:52.489> I've<00:03:52.609> seen<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:53.000> before<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:54.729> it<00:03:55.729> was

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
think I've seen that before and it was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.969 
think I've seen that before and it was
pretty<00:03:56.359> standard<00:03:56.900> but<00:03:56.930> easy<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.590> use<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.889> it

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
pretty standard but easy to use and it

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.289 
pretty standard but easy to use and it
should<00:03:58.099> be<00:03:58.189> easy<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.549> set<00:03:58.849> up<00:03:58.879> for<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
should be easy to set up for the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.670 
should be easy to set up for the
majority<00:03:59.599> of<00:03:59.780> users<00:04:00.139> out<00:04:00.260> there<00:04:00.439> but<00:04:00.590> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
majority of users out there but it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.800 
majority of users out there but it
doesn't<00:04:00.979> need<00:04:01.459> too<00:04:01.790> much<00:04:02.000> adjustment<00:04:02.629> from

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
doesn't need too much adjustment from

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.759 
doesn't need too much adjustment from
the<00:04:03.019> factory

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
the factory

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.189 
the factory
so<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.489> should<00:04:04.819> just<00:04:04.849> be<00:04:05.120> able<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.449> set<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> few

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
so you should just be able to set a few

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.899 
so you should just be able to set a few
things<00:04:06.439> up<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.769> have<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:07.010> exactly<00:04:07.549> how<00:04:07.879> you

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
things up and have it exactly how you

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.629 
things up and have it exactly how you
want<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.689> image<00:04:09.470> quality<00:04:09.680> wise<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.370> guy<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
want it image quality wise this guy is

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.780 
want it image quality wise this guy is
going<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:10.909> be<00:04:11.030> absolutely<00:04:11.599> perfect<00:04:12.319> for

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
going to be absolutely perfect for

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.280 
going to be absolutely perfect for
consuming<00:04:13.790> meteor<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:14.449> watching<00:04:14.750> media<00:04:15.079> or

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
consuming meteor on so watching media or

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.719 
consuming meteor on so watching media or
videos<00:04:15.620> or<00:04:15.859> anything<00:04:16.009> like<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.549> looks

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
videos or anything like that it looks

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.490 
videos or anything like that it looks
really<00:04:17.209> really<00:04:17.239> good<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> colors<00:04:18.169> really<00:04:18.380> pop

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
really really good the colors really pop

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.759 
really really good the colors really pop
I<00:04:18.979> just<00:04:19.820> really<00:04:20.150> liked<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.630> for<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.289> but<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
I just really liked it for that but it

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.980 
I just really liked it for that but it
would<00:04:21.859> also<00:04:22.039> be<00:04:22.340> quite<00:04:22.520> good<00:04:22.729> for<00:04:22.789> office<00:04:23.779> type

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
would also be quite good for office type

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.899 
would also be quite good for office type
work<00:04:24.200> as<00:04:24.349> well<00:04:24.529> text<00:04:24.889> was<00:04:25.039> very<00:04:25.250> easy<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.729> read

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
work as well text was very easy to read

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.700 
work as well text was very easy to read
so<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.270> does<00:04:26.419> a<00:04:26.450> very<00:04:26.599> good<00:04:27.110> job

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
so it does a very good job

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.950 
so it does a very good job
both<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.220> those<00:04:28.340> areas<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:29.090> because<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.870> an

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
both of those areas and because it's an

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.980 
both of those areas and because it's an
IPS<00:04:30.259> display<00:04:30.350> viewing<00:04:31.160> angles<00:04:31.520> are<00:04:31.639> also

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
IPS display viewing angles are also

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.590 
IPS display viewing angles are also
fantastic<00:04:32.990> when<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> came<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.130> gaming<00:04:34.699> with

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
fantastic when it came to gaming with

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.839 
fantastic when it came to gaming with
those<00:04:35.780> response<00:04:36.229> times<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.919> did<00:04:37.190> better<00:04:37.520> than

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
those response times it did better than

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.420 
those response times it did better than
I<00:04:38.090> actually<00:04:38.330> expected<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.590> do<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.130> this<00:04:40.370> is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
I actually expected it to do but this is

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.379 
I actually expected it to do but this is
no<00:04:40.789> purebred<00:04:41.599> gaming<00:04:42.349> display<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:44.210> it's

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
no purebred gaming display and so it's

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.550 
no purebred gaming display and so it's
not<00:04:44.479> going<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.780> be<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.229> know<00:04:45.349> really

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
not going to be you know really

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.960 
not going to be you know really
incredible<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.370> still<00:04:46.580> did<00:04:46.699> a<00:04:46.789> pretty

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
incredible but it still did a pretty

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.300 
incredible but it still did a pretty
good<00:04:47.150> job<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.870> think<00:04:48.199> people<00:04:48.470> might<00:04:48.650> you

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
good job so I think people might you

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.620 
good job so I think people might you
know<00:04:49.430> knock<00:04:49.729> it<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.000> bit<00:04:50.150> before<00:04:50.330> they've

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
know knock it a bit before they've

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.330 
know knock it a bit before they've
actually<00:04:50.660> tried<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.319> just<00:04:51.470> by<00:04:51.770> looking<00:04:52.160> at<00:04:52.220> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
actually tried it just by looking at the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.860 
actually tried it just by looking at the
specs<00:04:52.639> but<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:52.940> actually<00:04:53.030> does<00:04:53.419> a<00:04:53.449> pretty

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
specs but it actually does a pretty

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.320 
specs but it actually does a pretty
decent<00:04:54.020> job<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:54.949> if<00:04:55.370> it's<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.759> bit<00:04:55.940> too<00:04:56.090> slow

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
decent job and if it's a bit too slow

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.969 
decent job and if it's a bit too slow
the<00:04:56.479> response<00:04:56.870> time<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.259> normal<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.680> can

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
the response time on normal you can

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.830 
the response time on normal you can
always<00:04:58.130> change<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.729> fast<00:04:59.060> mode<00:04:59.360> as<00:04:59.599> well

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
always change it to fast mode as well

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.260 
always change it to fast mode as well
which<00:05:00.500> will<00:05:00.710> help<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:01.070> little<00:05:01.250> bit<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:01.699> yeah<00:05:02.180> it

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
which will help a little bit but yeah it

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.939 
which will help a little bit but yeah it
wasn't<00:05:02.479> that<00:05:02.660> bad<00:05:02.870> for<00:05:03.110> gaming<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.500> didn't

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
wasn't that bad for gaming I didn't

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.439 
wasn't that bad for gaming I didn't
really<00:05:04.160> have<00:05:04.340> too<00:05:04.520> many<00:05:04.610> issues<00:05:04.820> with<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.360> at

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
really have too many issues with it at

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.300 
really have too many issues with it at
all<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.900> still<00:05:06.169> does<00:05:06.349> pretty<00:05:06.590> solidly<00:05:07.009> when

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
all so it still does pretty solidly when

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.810 
all so it still does pretty solidly when
it<00:05:07.400> comes<00:05:07.610> for<00:05:07.880> comes<00:05:08.449> to<00:05:08.720> gaming<00:05:09.610> now<00:05:10.610> for

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
it comes for comes to gaming now for

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.450 
it comes for comes to gaming now for
general<00:05:11.180> use<00:05:11.389> is<00:05:12.139> also<00:05:12.590> really<00:05:12.860> good<00:05:13.099> because

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
general use is also really good because

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.060 
general use is also really good because
being<00:05:13.699> 1440p<00:05:14.389> it<00:05:14.750> gives<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.199> nice<00:05:15.530> big

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
being 1440p it gives you that nice big

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.770 
being 1440p it gives you that nice big
amount<00:05:16.430> of<00:05:16.610> screen<00:05:16.880> real<00:05:17.120> estate<00:05:17.150> without

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
amount of screen real estate without

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.510 
amount of screen real estate without
having<00:05:18.169> to<00:05:18.259> scale<00:05:18.560> everything<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.280> make<00:05:19.370> it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
having to scale everything and make it

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.550 
having to scale everything and make it
all<00:05:19.610> look<00:05:19.789> horrible<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.419> so<00:05:20.870> really<00:05:21.080> like<00:05:21.380> that

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
all look horrible I so really like that

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.189 
all look horrible I so really like that
-<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.949> just<00:05:22.130> makes<00:05:22.280> multitasking<00:05:23.180> way<00:05:23.539> easier

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
- it just makes multitasking way easier

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.529 
- it just makes multitasking way easier
so<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:25.009> really<00:05:25.250> good<00:05:25.580> for<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:25.880> as<00:05:26.060> well<00:05:26.270> and

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
so it's really good for that as well and

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.899 
so it's really good for that as well and
in<00:05:26.930> conclusion<00:05:27.139> it's<00:05:27.740> just<00:05:28.069> a<00:05:28.159> great<00:05:28.699> value

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
in conclusion it's just a great value

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.879 
in conclusion it's just a great value
