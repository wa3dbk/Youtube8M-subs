00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
alright guys this is the setup probably

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.740 
alright guys this is the setup probably
not<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.150> able<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.359> see<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.540> goodness

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
not going to be able to see it goodness

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.200 
not going to be able to see it goodness
I'm<00:00:07.109> shining<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.620> down<00:00:07.830> here<00:00:09.620> this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
I'm shining right down here this is the

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.630 
I'm shining right down here this is the
box<00:00:13.009> put<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:15.570> car<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.710> got<00:00:17.369> some

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
box put in the car and I got some

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.019 
box put in the car and I got some
exhaust<00:00:18.029> pipe<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.949> is<00:00:19.949> flexible<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.820> ran

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
exhaust pipe that is flexible that I ran

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.439 
exhaust pipe that is flexible that I ran
over<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.740> right<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> PVC<00:00:23.519> elbow<00:00:27.830> the

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
over there right into a PVC elbow the

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.139 
over there right into a PVC elbow the
this<00:00:30.449> little<00:00:30.750> pipe<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.850> mass<00:00:32.850> airflow

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
this little pipe with the mass airflow

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.700 
this little pipe with the mass airflow
sensors<00:00:33.809> cannot

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.209 

fit<00:00:37.370> right<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.829> go<00:00:39.829> over<00:00:39.950> there<00:00:40.190> I'm

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
fit right on that and go over there I'm

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.880 
fit right on that and go over there I'm
probably<00:00:40.579> going<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.879> have<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.030> make<00:00:41.329> a<00:00:41.860> make<00:00:42.860> a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
probably going to have to make a make a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.799 
probably going to have to make a make a
custom<00:00:43.399> air-filter<00:00:44.210> just<00:00:46.360> just<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.449> put<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:47.690> on

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
custom air-filter just just to put it on

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.780 
custom air-filter just just to put it on
there<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:48.250> because<00:00:49.250> I<00:00:49.340> don't<00:00:49.489> have<00:00:49.519> enough

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
there and because I don't have enough

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.090 
there and because I don't have enough
room<00:00:50.170> under<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.260> hood<00:00:51.410> for<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:52.430> big<00:00:52.640> one<00:00:52.850> that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
room under the hood for the big one that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.490 
room under the hood for the big one that
is<00:00:55.100> stock<00:00:55.400> with<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.730> car<00:00:56.019> but<00:00:57.019> that<00:00:57.260> shouldn't

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
is stock with the car but that shouldn't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.790 
is stock with the car but that shouldn't
be<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.680> problem<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:59.170> started<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.290> up<00:01:00.379> with<00:01:00.649> the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
be a problem I started it up with the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.759 
be a problem I started it up with the
system<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:02.110> actually<00:01:03.110> works<00:01:03.290> pretty<00:01:03.409> good<00:01:03.620> i

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
system it actually works pretty good i

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.919 
system it actually works pretty good i
was<00:01:04.009> able<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.309> start<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.780> pretty<00:01:05.780> fast<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
was able to start it pretty fast and the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:10.719 
was able to start it pretty fast and the
heating<00:01:09.320> elements<00:01:09.740> actually<00:01:10.039> get<00:01:10.190> hotter<00:01:10.429> as

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
heating elements actually get hotter as

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.340 
heating elements actually get hotter as
it<00:01:11.060> goes<00:01:11.210> so<00:01:11.600> there's<00:01:11.869> not<00:01:12.020> going<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.229> be<00:01:12.289> a

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
it goes so there's not going to be a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.590 
it goes so there's not going to be a
problem<00:01:12.500> with<00:01:12.740> heat<00:01:12.920> loss<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.030> also<00:01:14.330> they<00:01:14.450> get

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
problem with heat loss and also they get

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.719 
problem with heat loss and also they get
hot<00:01:14.750> enough<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.710> doesn't<00:01:15.740> have<00:01:16.399> any

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
hot enough that it doesn't have any

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.859 
hot enough that it doesn't have any
extra<00:01:18.250> sludge<00:01:19.250> build-up<00:01:20.090> or<00:01:20.300> anything<00:01:20.840> that

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
extra sludge build-up or anything that

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.169 
extra sludge build-up or anything that
I'm<00:01:21.320> going<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.800> get<00:01:21.920> rid<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.160> which<00:01:22.970> is

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
I'm going to have to get rid of which is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:24.820 
I'm going to have to get rid of which is
kind<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.780> nice<00:01:23.899> because<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.380> was<00:01:24.500> looking

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
kind of nice because I was looking

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.320 
kind of nice because I was looking
forward<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.100> making<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.429> float<00:01:25.670> system<00:01:26.090> and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
forward to making a float system and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.999 
forward to making a float system and
trying<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.690> figure<00:01:26.780> out<00:01:26.929> where<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.410> take<00:01:27.740> that

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
trying to figure out where to take that

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.029 
trying to figure out where to take that
crap<00:01:28.630> but<00:01:29.630> yeah<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:30.289> one<00:01:30.440> hundred<00:01:30.649> percent<00:01:30.679> of

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
crap but yeah so one hundred percent of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.790 
crap but yeah so one hundred percent of
it<00:01:31.159> just<00:01:31.369> goes<00:01:31.909> right<00:01:32.119> up<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.570> around<00:01:33.560> in

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
it just goes right up and around in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.580 
it just goes right up and around in
there<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:35.300> reason<00:01:35.600> why<00:01:35.690> I'm<00:01:35.929> not<00:01:36.080> starting<00:01:36.409> it

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
there the reason why I'm not starting it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.350 
there the reason why I'm not starting it
up<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.009> reason<00:01:37.250> why<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:37.640> not<00:01:37.909> driving<00:01:38.300> it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
up and the reason why I'm not driving it

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.310 
up and the reason why I'm not driving it
around<00:01:38.479> right<00:01:39.020> now<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.470> because<00:01:40.210> this<00:01:41.320> fuel

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
around right now is because this fuel

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.020 
around right now is because this fuel
injector<00:01:42.829> right<00:01:43.070> here<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.140> leaking<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.030> it's

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
injector right here is leaking and it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.830 
injector right here is leaking and it's
a<00:01:47.299> pretty<00:01:47.540> nice<00:01:47.840> sized<00:01:48.140> leak<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.659> before<00:01:50.659> i<00:01:50.689> do

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
a pretty nice sized leak so before i do

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.380 
a pretty nice sized leak so before i do
anything<00:01:51.200> i'm<00:01:51.470> going<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.100> take<00:01:52.790> the

anything i'm going to have to take the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.100 
anything i'm going to have to take the
fuel<00:01:53.659> rail<00:01:53.869> off<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.409> got<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> kit<00:01:55.750> right<00:01:56.750> heck<00:01:56.960> are

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
fuel rail off I got a kit right heck are

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.039 
fuel rail off I got a kit right heck are
those<00:01:57.290> things<00:02:02.140> this<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.520> toe<00:02:04.939> ring

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
you guys ever have a leaky fuel injector

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.050 
you guys ever have a leaky fuel injector
this<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.819> way<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:18.970> go<00:02:19.680> unless<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.099> run<00:02:21.910> into

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
this is the way to go unless I run into

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
this is the way to go unless I run into
something<00:02:22.360> else<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:23.170> know<00:02:23.319> um<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.709> yeah

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
something else I don't know um but yeah

something else I don't know um but yeah
you<00:02:27.010> can<00:02:27.099> get<00:02:27.280> those<00:02:27.459> at<00:02:27.959> autozone<00:02:28.959> carquest

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you can get those at autozone carquest

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.210 
you can get those at autozone carquest
whatever<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.730> want<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:33.010> definitely

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
whatever you want but it's definitely

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.039 
whatever you want but it's definitely
cheaper<00:02:33.580> than<00:02:33.879> replacing<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.540> entire<00:02:34.599> fuel

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
cheaper than replacing the entire fuel

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.800 
cheaper than replacing the entire fuel
injector<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.420> taking<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> mechanic

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
injector and taking it to a mechanic

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.780 
injector and taking it to a mechanic
there's<00:02:41.250> only<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.430> couple<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:43.750> couple<00:02:44.790> bolts

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
there's only a couple a couple bolts

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.460 
there's only a couple a couple bolts
holding<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.420> fuel<00:02:46.900> rail<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.819> its<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:50.349> get

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
holding this fuel rail on its I can get

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.240 
holding this fuel rail on its I can get
it<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.890> camera<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.640> now<00:02:52.180> there's<00:02:52.540> one

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it now at the camera but now there's one

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.210 
it now at the camera but now there's one
and<00:02:54.250> then<00:03:00.209> maybe<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.329> saw<00:03:01.540> maybe<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> didn't

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and then maybe you saw maybe it didn't

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.210 
and then maybe you saw maybe it didn't
it's<00:03:03.220> kind<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.549> pinch<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.879> there<00:03:04.030> but<00:03:04.540> I'm

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's kind of a pinch in there but I'm

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.890 
it's kind of a pinch in there but I'm
also<00:03:06.220> i<00:03:06.730> don't<00:03:07.690> know<00:03:09.329> if<00:03:10.329> this<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.599> going<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
also i don't know if this is going to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.190 
also i don't know if this is going to
cause<00:03:11.109> problems<00:03:11.889> I<00:03:12.690> don't<00:03:13.690> think<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.930> really

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
cause problems I don't think I really

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.000 
cause problems I don't think I really
asked<00:03:14.560> anything<00:03:14.769> about<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:19.079> but<00:03:20.079> this<00:03:20.319> is<00:03:20.380> that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
asked anything about it but this is that

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.400 
asked anything about it but this is that
I<00:03:21.160> think<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.880> return<00:03:22.239> line<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.109> tank

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
I think the return line to the tank

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.410 
I think the return line to the tank
that's<00:03:23.889> where<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.099> cut<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.430> off<00:03:24.579> right<00:03:24.849> here

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
that's where I cut it off right here

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.400 
that's where I cut it off right here
outside<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.849> which<00:03:27.849> I'm<00:03:28.410> thinking

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
outside of this which I'm thinking

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.339 
outside of this which I'm thinking
that's<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.780> pressure<00:03:32.130> regulator

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
that's like the pressure regulator

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.750 
that's like the pressure regulator
something<00:03:35.349> that's<00:03:35.500> got<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.680> wire<00:03:35.950> while<00:03:36.639> you're

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
something that's got a wire while you're

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.909 
something that's got a wire while you're
on<00:03:36.880> this<00:03:37.000> side<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.989> hear<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.530> connects<00:03:38.829> with

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
on this side to hear it connects with

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.089 
on this side to hear it connects with
the<00:03:39.040> fuel<00:03:39.579> rail<00:03:39.790> right<00:03:40.000> there<00:03:41.849> no<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:42.880> was<00:03:44.099> if

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
the fuel rail right there no I was if

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.800 
the fuel rail right there no I was if
anybody<00:03:45.489> knows<00:03:45.669> anything<00:03:45.700> about<00:03:46.120> cars<00:03:46.540> I'd

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
anybody knows anything about cars I'd

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.400 
anybody knows anything about cars I'd
like<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.079> know<00:03:47.230> if<00:03:47.500> that's<00:03:47.799> okay<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.819> I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
like to know if that's okay to do I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.509 
like to know if that's okay to do I
don't<00:03:50.410> know<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:50.799> putting<00:03:51.280> too<00:03:51.370> much

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
don't know if I'm putting too much

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.979 
don't know if I'm putting too much
pressure<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.180> lines<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:52.690> that's<00:03:52.810> what

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
pressure in the lines and that's what

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.520 
pressure in the lines and that's what
caused<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.590> blowout<00:03:53.829> of<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.459> fuel<00:03:54.849> injector

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
caused the blowout of the fuel injector

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.009 
caused the blowout of the fuel injector
over<00:03:56.530> there<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:59.819> don't<00:04:00.819> know<00:04:00.880> maybe<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.209> had<00:04:01.870> this

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
over there I don't know maybe I had this

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.720 
over there I don't know maybe I had this
fuel<00:04:02.260> rail<00:04:02.440> off<00:04:02.650> before<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.340> didn't<00:04:03.609> notice

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
fuel rail off before and I didn't notice

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.270 
fuel rail off before and I didn't notice
it<00:04:04.000> leaked<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.440> I've<00:04:05.440> been<00:04:05.680> experimenting

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it leaked and I've been experimenting

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.430 
it leaked and I've been experimenting
the<00:04:07.000> whole<00:04:07.150> time<00:04:07.389> with<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.780> tide<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.139> to<00:04:08.260> hear

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
the whole time with the tide in to hear

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.140 
the whole time with the tide in to hear
a<00:04:08.470> book<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.919> I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.969 

no<00:04:13.879> but<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:14.909> was<00:04:15.180> just<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:16.079> anybody<00:04:16.470> knows<00:04:16.680> I

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
no but I was just if anybody knows I

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.560 
no but I was just if anybody knows I
mean<00:04:17.190> maybe<00:04:17.310> there's<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.669> better<00:04:17.850> place<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.359> tie

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
mean maybe there's a better place to tie

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.390 
mean maybe there's a better place to tie
into<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.900> fuel<00:04:22.199> where<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.250> would<00:04:23.370> be

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
into the the fuel where it would be

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.480 
into the the fuel where it would be
pressurized<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.949> without<00:04:25.949> damaging

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
pressurized and without damaging

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.090 
pressurized and without damaging
anything<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:33.380> don't<00:04:34.380> know<00:04:34.500> if<00:04:34.650> anybody's<00:04:35.009> got

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
anything I don't know if anybody's got

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.230 
anything I don't know if anybody's got
any<00:04:35.160> ideas<00:04:35.639> I'd<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.330> hear<00:04:36.509> um<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:38.190> ok<00:04:39.120> I'm

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
any ideas I'd like to hear um but ok I'm

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
take her out on the road maybe tomorrow

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.340 
take her out on the road maybe tomorrow
or<00:04:45.840> someone<00:04:46.550> but<00:04:47.550> alright<00:04:48.389> guys<00:04:48.660> thanks<00:04:49.289> for
