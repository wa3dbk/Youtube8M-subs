00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
but this here ahead of me is a unlucky

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.109 
but this here ahead of me is a unlucky
block<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.100> I'm<00:01:43.159> gonna<00:01:43.280> show<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.520> what<00:01:43.700> happens

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
block so I'm gonna show you what happens

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.960 
block so I'm gonna show you what happens
once<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.020> mined<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:45.770> one<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.189> let's<00:01:46.790> go<00:01:46.909> ahead

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
once I mined this one so let's go ahead

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.389 
once I mined this one so let's go ahead
and<00:01:47.060> pick<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.329> right<00:01:47.479> spot<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.930> mine<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.560> now

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
and pick the right spot and mine it now

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.090 
and pick the right spot and mine it now
to<00:01:49.460> again<00:01:49.909> on<00:01:50.060> PC<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.630> believe<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.380> would<00:01:51.560> not<00:01:51.799> be

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
to again on PC I believe it would not be

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.620 
to again on PC I believe it would not be
a<00:01:52.130> different<00:01:52.700> color<00:01:52.850> block<00:01:53.149> but<00:01:53.360> check<00:01:53.479> that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
a different color block but check that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.420 
a different color block but check that
out<00:01:53.750> see<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> mob<00:01:54.229> just<00:01:54.500> came<00:01:54.649> out<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.220> thought

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
out see a mob just came out so I thought

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.490 
out see a mob just came out so I thought
this<00:01:55.549> feature<00:01:55.759> was<00:01:55.970> just<00:01:56.180> very<00:01:56.390> cool<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
this feature was just very cool and it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.130 
this feature was just very cool and it
looked<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.979> looked<00:01:58.219> very<00:01:58.280> awesome<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.140> but

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
looked it looked very awesome so but

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.800 
looked it looked very awesome so but
also<00:02:00.829> lucky<00:02:01.130> blocks<00:02:01.399> do<00:02:01.670> spawn<00:02:02.000> up<00:02:02.210> structures

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
also lucky blocks do spawn up structures

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.200 
also lucky blocks do spawn up structures
mobs<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:03.890> items

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
mobs and items

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.060 
mobs and items
so<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.600> still<00:02:06.200> didn't<00:02:06.470> get<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.770> point<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
so I I still didn't get to the point to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.710 
so I I still didn't get to the point to
where<00:02:07.220> like<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.820> structure<00:02:08.119> part<00:02:08.450> so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
where like the the structure part so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.140 
where like the the structure part so
let's<00:02:09.200> say<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.410> mine<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.770> lucky<00:02:10.250> block<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.729> bam

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
let's say you mine a lucky block and bam

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.330 
let's say you mine a lucky block and bam
a<00:02:11.420> house<00:02:11.600> pops<00:02:11.959> up<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.220> is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
a house pops up that is just that is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
crazy to see something like that on

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.160 
crazy to see something like that on
consoles<00:02:15.830> would<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.850> amazing<00:02:17.810> but

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
