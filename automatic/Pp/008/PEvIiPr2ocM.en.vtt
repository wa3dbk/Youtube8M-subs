00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:15.719
 one to make a chicken broth that the 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.240
 people need to shop a carcass of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.939
 hen or chicken to give 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
 enough flavor is what I do here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.289
 when you bought country chicken when 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 kept the part of the carcass and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.759
 of the neck 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 precisely to make calculations and still 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.220
 uses bay leaf carrot onion and 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.680
 celery with great trick is that the trick 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.170
 very cool is the so seeing this blood 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 it stays down here when the network freezes 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 they run this blood in the water 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 boiling is all coagulated on top of the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.490
 water and this disrupts our 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.880
 car then we came here and pass 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:03.110
 one last water in the chicken to take this 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:05.670
 last stupid of him and that our chicken 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 It's already going to boil water. 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.159
 we have a clear broth that does not want 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.579
 a broth heard stirring was calm clear 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.799
 chicken then the pieces here to 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.420
 inside 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:33.139
 with boiling water 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:33.139
 it will not revoke the carrot and onion 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 bay leaf to the sound and this has to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.329
 cook for at least three hours 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.670
 after that time of two hours and then 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.670
 half an hour we have here a 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.520
 very cool broth very complete if you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.259
 want to go ahead if you want to make a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.630
 faster logical broth you can 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.789
 use the pressure cooker that the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.319
 people did the classic way then 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:15.660
 come on we have a broth here 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:18.250
 really with a very beautiful color 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.430
 the first to put on the plate that for you 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.430
 see 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.310
 Look what the beauty of chicken broth 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.760
 what we did 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.950
 maybe the onion has melted and what the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.860
 people have here so look at a car well 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.380
 yellow harsh humor an intense broth 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.269
 because we used hen or 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.080
 also hickory chicken if you did not have the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.630
 possibility 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.010
 You can use the regular chicken, there you go. 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.620

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.799

 cooking for you and that yields much more 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.690
