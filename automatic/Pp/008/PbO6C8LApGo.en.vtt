 Be sure to support and fix the ends 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.769
 of the lath channel to the mooring angle is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.650
 perform the metal reinforcements for 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.510

 cavity between the slab and the structure 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 Gypsum panel placement 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 the drywall is fixed by screwing it 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.099
 transversally to the ribbon channel with a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.470
 Maximum separation of screws of 20 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.510
 centimeters should be displaced 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.720
 panels so that the ends between 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 one and the other do not coincide in the meetings 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.160
 This will provide greater strength 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.890
 assemble cut panels with bracket 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.200
 and knife is recommended to use panel 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.780
 plaster ceiling break of half inch with 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 channel strip to every 61 centimeters or 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.250
 half-inch regular drywall 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.160
 with ribbon channel placed every 40 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.260
 6 centimeters points 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.120
 for term run have not been recommended 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.020
 the use of three regular drywall 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.580
 eighths of an inch joint treatment 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.380
 first for the gluing of the tape 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.350
 Apply composite on the board and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.700
 subsequently adhere the paper tape 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.550
 removing the excess with the spatula of 6 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.350
 inches later with the spatula of 8 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.000
 inch apply the first layer of 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.910
 compound covering the whole of the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.650
 tape once dry apply the second 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.200
 compound layer with the spatula of 10 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.760
 inches finally one is placed 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.550
 third layer with spatula 12 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.100
 inches if specified in the 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.050
 finished level 5 you should apply a 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.720
 compound layer to the entire surface 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.940
 of the panel this will help to standardize the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.860
 for the final finish prior to finishing 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.960
 end should sand very well the 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.090
 surface of the panel I recommend applying 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.880
 an acrylic sealer and two coats of 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.530
 painting in the case of soffits in areas 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.540
 Wet company is resistant to 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.070
 humidity the joint treatment is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.280
 made with fiberglass tape 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.130
 3 inch and basecoating 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.810
 Once dry the plucking covers all the 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.230
 surface of the soffit with a layer of 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.150
 important base coating in the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.160
 ceiling junctions to an existing wall 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.260
 according to the case and the specification 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120
 of the designer is recommended to place 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.799
 paper tape or fiber ribbon 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 glass in the square with composite 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.820
 leave a separation of an eighth of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.580
 inch and fill with acrylic sealer 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.139
 pink table to provoke the board is 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.139
 recommends the placement of erebor
