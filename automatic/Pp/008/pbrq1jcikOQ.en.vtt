a<00:00:38.610> knife<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> cut<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> dough<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.579> rolling<00:00:41.579> pin

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
a knife to cut the dough a rolling pin

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
a knife to cut the dough a rolling pin
which<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.329> stuff<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.750> easily<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> clean

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
which this stuff is very easily to clean

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.970 
which this stuff is very easily to clean
off

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
off

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
off
and<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:45.000> course<00:00:45.300> our<00:00:45.660> clay<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.550> clay<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and of course our clay so the clay that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
and of course our clay so the clay that
I'm<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> using<00:00:49.020> today<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'm going to be using today is for a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.600 
I'm going to be using today is for a
footprint<00:00:51.000> ghost<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.050> hollow

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
footprint ghost just in time for hollow

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
footprint ghost just in time for hollow
so<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.879> our<00:00:54.000> ball<00:00:54.180> already<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.440> suggest

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
so we get our ball already and I suggest

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
so we get our ball already and I suggest
massaging<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> nice<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.570> warm

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
massaging it so that it's nice and warm

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.560 
massaging it so that it's nice and warm
it<00:00:58.079> makes<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.500> pliable<00:00:59.059> not<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> big<00:01:00.390> deal

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it makes it more pliable not a big deal

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.100 
it makes it more pliable not a big deal
but<00:01:01.430> every<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.730> helps<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.809> let's<00:01:03.989> get

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but every little bit helps so let's get

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
but every little bit helps so let's get
started

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 

you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.430 

okay<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.090> I'm<00:01:16.450> not<00:01:16.570> suggesting<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.230> for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
okay so I'm not suggesting this for

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.230 
okay so I'm not suggesting this for
everybody<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.700> actually<00:01:18.910> put<00:01:19.210> my

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
everybody but I actually put my

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.700 
everybody but I actually put my
daughters<00:01:19.630> on<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.810> counter<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:20.380> they<00:01:20.560> can

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
daughters on the counter so they can

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.900 
daughters on the counter so they can
step<00:01:20.920> down<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.190> now<00:01:21.250> I'll<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.580> move<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
step down and now I'll have to move the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.850 
step down and now I'll have to move the
