00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.009 
through it and also I don't know what I
was<00:03:50.739> thinking<00:03:51.150> somewhere<00:03:52.150> along<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.659> line<00:03:52.840> I

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
was thinking somewhere along the line I

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.589 
was thinking somewhere along the line I
remember<00:03:53.620> doing<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.730> used<00:03:54.939> a<00:03:55.060> sponge<00:03:55.359> to

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
remember doing it but I used a sponge to

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.449 
remember doing it but I used a sponge to
wipe<00:03:55.629> off<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.079> inside<00:03:56.379> why<00:03:56.889> would<00:03:57.159> I<00:03:57.189> do<00:03:57.310> that

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
wipe off the inside why would I do that

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.089 
wipe off the inside why would I do that
because<00:03:57.790> look<00:03:58.120> when<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.870> do<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.859> mix

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
because look when you do that you mix

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.869 
because look when you do that you mix
the<00:04:00.569> brown<00:04:01.569> color<00:04:02.379> with<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:03.040> white<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.609> pure

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
the brown color with the white the pure

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.699 
the brown color with the white the pure
white<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.329> was<00:04:04.449> down<00:04:04.659> here<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.169> then<00:04:05.590> you

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
white that was down here and then you

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.619 
white that was down here and then you
mix<00:04:05.919> the<00:04:06.129> white<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:06.699> brown<00:04:07.030> up<00:04:07.269> here<00:04:07.479> so

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
mix the white with the brown up here so

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.909 
mix the white with the brown up here so
it's<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:07.840> smudged<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.470> didn't<00:04:08.650> even<00:04:08.769> know

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
it's a little smudged I didn't even know

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.830 
it's a little smudged I didn't even know
until<00:04:08.979> I<00:04:09.129> took<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.519> out<00:04:09.609> of<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.879> disk<00:04:10.510> I
