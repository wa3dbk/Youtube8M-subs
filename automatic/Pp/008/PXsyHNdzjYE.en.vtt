00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
river and I have all my tech out so i
probably<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> military<00:01:36.750> advantage<00:01:37.259> over

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
probably have a military advantage over

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.880 
probably have a military advantage over
him<00:01:37.500> also<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.570> his<00:01:39.570> cannons<00:01:40.049> discount<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
him also and now his cannons discount is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.969 
him also and now his cannons discount is
going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> go<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.479> most<00:01:42.479> likely<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> wow

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
going to go down most likely and wow

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
going to go down most likely and wow
that's<00:01:44.189> very<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.880> placement<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.390> his<00:01:45.540> part<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that's very good placement on his part I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.060 
that's very good placement on his part I
never<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.350> thought<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.829> placement

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
never really thought that placement

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.969 
never really thought that placement
would<00:01:47.450> be<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.259> can't<00:01:49.740> believe<00:01:49.829> he's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
would be there I can't believe he's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
would be there I can't believe he's
actually<00:01:50.100> arranging<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.299> whatever<00:01:51.420> now

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
actually arranging it but whatever now

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.990 
actually arranging it but whatever now
as<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.470> goes<00:01:52.799> down<00:01:53.009> no<00:01:53.670> way<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
as you can see I goes down no way was it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940 
as you can see I goes down no way was it
no<00:01:54.360> way<00:01:54.509> was<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.920> up

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
no way was I going to that can go up

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
no way was I going to that can go up
never<00:01:56.729> lick<00:01:56.939> hands<00:01:57.180> go<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.450> by<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> way<00:01:57.930> if

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
never lick hands go up by the way if

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.440 
never lick hands go up by the way if
they're<00:01:58.259> morphing<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.090> that's<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> me

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
they're morphing and that's kind of me

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
they're morphing and that's kind of me
being<00:02:00.659> retarded<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.979> whatever

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
being retarded right there but whatever

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
being retarded right there but whatever
now<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> got<00:02:02.939> rivers<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.899> don't

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
now I got rivers out and now I don't

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.350 
now I got rivers out and now I don't
have<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.590> game<00:02:04.799> fully<00:02:05.250> down<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> huge

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
have this game fully down but I'm a huge

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.540 
have this game fully down but I'm a huge
advantage<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:08.310> him<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
advantage right now because for him to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.350 
advantage right now because for him to
when<00:02:08.700> he's<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.119> pull<00:02:09.270> off

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
when he's gonna have to pull off

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.430 
when he's gonna have to pull off
something<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.810> crazy

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
something pretty crazy

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.530 
something pretty crazy
and<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:12.610> now<00:02:12.760> yeah<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.120> gonna<00:02:13.300> use<00:02:13.420> my

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and right now yeah I just gonna use my

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.540 
and right now yeah I just gonna use my
river<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.960> try<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.260> kill<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> few<00:02:15.010> thoughts<00:02:15.220> and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
river to try to kill a few thoughts and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.400 
river to try to kill a few thoughts and
break<00:02:15.820> oh<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.210> yeah<00:02:16.480> he<00:02:16.630> really<00:02:16.960> committed<00:02:17.380> to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
break oh and yeah he really committed to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.860 
break oh and yeah he really committed to
this<00:02:17.830> contain<00:02:18.250> no<00:02:19.150> way<00:02:19.300> we're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:19.840> able

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
this contain no way we're gonna be able

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.800 
this contain no way we're gonna be able
to<00:02:20.050> break<00:02:20.170> out<00:02:20.320> would<00:02:20.470> just<00:02:20.680> um<00:02:21.420> would<00:02:22.420> just

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
to break out would just um would just

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.680 
to break out would just um would just
what<00:02:23.080> he<00:02:23.140> called<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.640> army<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.790> had<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.210> have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so now as you can see the flowers else

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
so now as you can see the flowers else
they're<00:02:32.440> kind<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.710> bad<00:02:32.860> multitasking<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.520> this

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
they're kind of bad multitasking in this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.150 
they're kind of bad multitasking in this
part<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.090> whatever<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.630> he<00:02:35.020> has<00:02:35.110> no<00:02:35.260> he<00:02:36.070> has

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
part but whatever and he has no he has

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.280 
part but whatever and he has no he has
no<00:02:36.280> he<00:02:37.060> there's<00:02:37.390> no<00:02:37.480> way<00:02:37.600> for<00:02:37.660> him<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.840> pump<00:02:38.110> out

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
no he there's no way for him to pump out

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.320 
no he there's no way for him to pump out
units<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:38.800> now<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> for<00:02:39.670> dt<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.030> going<00:02:40.240> to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
units right now and for dt is going to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.830 
units right now and for dt is going to
go<00:02:40.420> do<00:02:40.630> some<00:02:40.810> more<00:02:40.930> drop<00:02:41.370> drop<00:02:42.370> drop<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.810> I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
go do some more drop drop drop the I

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.080 
go do some more drop drop drop the I
pretty<00:02:44.050> much<00:02:44.140> nothing<00:02:44.380> else<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.070> thought<00:02:46.030> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
pretty much nothing else on I thought I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.070 
pretty much nothing else on I thought I
was<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.390> see<00:02:46.480> something<00:02:46.660> afterwards

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
was going to see something afterwards

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.520 
was going to see something afterwards
but<00:02:47.200> anyways<00:02:47.470> um<00:02:47.740> yeah<00:02:48.670> again<00:02:49.390> these<00:02:50.080> gateways

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
but anyways um yeah again these gateways

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.900 
but anyways um yeah again these gateways
are<00:02:50.770> down<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.190> there's<00:02:51.490> no<00:02:51.580> way<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.730> him<00:02:51.820> to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
are down so there's no way for him to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.720 
are down so there's no way for him to
produce<00:02:52.120> more<00:02:52.300> units<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.220> he<00:02:54.220> whatever<00:02:54.520> he

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
produce more units and he whatever he

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.010 
produce more units and he whatever he
has<00:02:54.880> he<00:02:55.060> has<00:02:55.090> right<00:02:55.360> now<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.750> guess<00:02:55.900> he's

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
has he has right now I guess he's

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.450 
has he has right now I guess he's
probably<00:02:56.170> gonna<00:02:56.320> go<00:02:56.470> mass<00:02:56.710> cannons<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.370> you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
probably gonna go mass cannons but you

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.250 
probably gonna go mass cannons but you
know<00:02:57.550> Reavers<00:02:57.850> always<00:02:58.090> out<00:02:58.210> any<00:02:58.390> chance<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.020> I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
know Reavers always out any chance so I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260 
know Reavers always out any chance so I
have<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.790> actually<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> kind<00:03:01.150> of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
have like this is actually a kind of

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.730 
have like this is actually a kind of
weird<00:03:01.510> build<00:03:01.720> order<00:03:01.930> i'm<00:03:02.020> doing<00:03:02.230> i<00:03:02.290> generally

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
weird build order i'm doing i generally

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.900 
weird build order i'm doing i generally
don't<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.130> do<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> Reaver<00:03:03.700> thing

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
don't like to do with the Reaver thing

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.100 
don't like to do with the Reaver thing
but<00:03:04.060> he<00:03:04.120> had<00:03:04.240> me<00:03:04.360> contained<00:03:04.690> until<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.900> kind<00:03:05.080> of

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
but he had me contained until I kind of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.460 
but he had me contained until I kind of
had<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:06.190> he<00:03:07.060> pretty<00:03:07.300> much<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:08.230> going

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.220 
had to but he pretty much I'm going
Reavers<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.070> dt<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.880> d<00:03:09.970> tease<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.540> kind<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
Reavers and dt and d tease so kind of

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860 
Reavers and dt and d tease so kind of
like<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> Reaver<00:03:11.680> dt<00:03:11.980> build<00:03:12.190> order<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.940> don't

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
like a Reaver dt build order I don't

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.030 
like a Reaver dt build order I don't
know<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:14.020> that's<00:03:14.200> actually<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.470> builder<00:03:14.740> board

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
know if that's actually a builder board

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.110 
know if that's actually a builder board
ever<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.400> now<00:03:15.459> I'm<00:03:15.550> gonna<00:03:15.640> try<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.850> go<00:03:15.970> over

have<00:03:29.170> two<00:03:29.290> rivers<00:03:29.590> these<00:03:29.800> rivers<00:03:30.220> are<00:03:30.340> gonna

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
have two rivers these rivers are gonna

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.979 
have two rivers these rivers are gonna
pretty<00:03:30.880> much<00:03:30.970> won<00:03:31.150> me<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.300> game<00:03:31.390> pretty<00:03:31.780> sure

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
pretty much won me the game pretty sure

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.120 
pretty much won me the game pretty sure
there's<00:03:32.440> no<00:03:32.530> way<00:03:32.620> he's<00:03:32.739> gonna<00:03:32.830> be<00:03:32.920> able<00:03:32.980> to

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
there's no way he's gonna be able to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.210 
there's no way he's gonna be able to
kill<00:03:33.220> these<00:03:33.370> rivers<00:03:33.640> with<00:03:33.820> what<00:03:34.030> he<00:03:34.090> has<00:03:34.239> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
kill these rivers with what he has and

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.199 
kill these rivers with what he has and
I'm<00:03:36.220> just<00:03:36.400> waiting<00:03:36.580> for<00:03:36.700> these<00:03:36.760> cans<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.120> go

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
I'm just waiting for these cans to go

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.460 
I'm just waiting for these cans to go
down<00:03:37.360> once<00:03:37.570> they<00:03:37.660> do<00:03:37.720> go<00:03:37.930> down<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.260> going<00:03:38.380> to

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
down once they do go down I'm going to

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.710 
down once they do go down I'm going to
pretty<00:03:38.739> much<00:03:38.860> owned<00:03:39.040> him<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.360> he<00:03:40.390> gets<00:03:40.630> his

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
pretty much owned him and so he gets his

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.060 
pretty much owned him and so he gets his
robotics<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.230> said<00:03:41.350> he<00:03:41.470> gets<00:03:41.650> an<00:03:41.739> observatory

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
robotics and said he gets an observatory

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.460 
robotics and said he gets an observatory
but<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.760> think<00:03:43.269> it's<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.420> little<00:03:43.480> too<00:03:43.660> little<00:03:44.350> too

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
but I think it's a little too little too

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.790 
but I think it's a little too little too
late<00:03:44.500> pretty<00:03:44.920> much<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.560> way<00:03:47.739> too

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
late pretty much and now I have way too

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.410 
late pretty much and now I have way too
many<00:03:47.920> units<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.880> don't<00:03:49.150> know<00:03:49.209> why<00:03:49.330> I'm

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
many units and I don't know why I'm

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.300 
many units and I don't know why I'm
running<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.750> river<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.290> fully<00:03:50.500> have<00:03:50.709> to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
running this river I fully have to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.420 
running this river I fully have to
shield<00:03:51.489> batteries<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.870> whatever<00:03:53.200> now<00:03:53.860> i<00:03:53.890> have

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
shield batteries but whatever now i have

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.300 
shield batteries but whatever now i have
my<00:03:55.019> shadow<00:03:56.019> lot<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.470> these<00:03:56.680> rivers<00:03:56.980> can<00:03:57.190> also

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
my shadow lot so these rivers can also

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.040 
my shadow lot so these rivers can also
be<00:03:57.489> micro<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.090> going<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:58.720> get<00:03:58.840> this<00:03:58.930> other

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
be micro and going to get this other

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.650 
be micro and going to get this other
shuttle<00:03:59.440> here<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.610> other<00:04:00.730> river<00:04:01.060> here<00:04:01.300> to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
shuttle here this other river here to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.900 
shuttle here this other river here to
pretty<00:04:01.930> much<00:04:02.050> kill<00:04:02.110> these<00:04:02.500> cannons<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.040> two

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
pretty much kill these cannons and two

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.850 
pretty much kill these cannons and two
rivers<00:04:04.360> if<00:04:04.510> they<00:04:04.630> hit<00:04:04.780> pretty<00:04:05.380> close<00:04:05.470> with

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
rivers if they hit pretty close with

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.130 
rivers if they hit pretty close with
each<00:04:06.459> other<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:06.850> if<00:04:07.540> they're<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.959> if

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
each other like if they're to it if

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.300 
each other like if they're to it if
their<00:04:08.290> attacks<00:04:08.560> are<00:04:08.709> pretty<00:04:08.890> close<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.220> each

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
their attacks are pretty close to each

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.910 
their attacks are pretty close to each
other<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.940> can<00:04:10.090> one<00:04:10.870> hit<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.709> hit<00:04:11.890> a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
other then you can one hit to hit a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.310 
other then you can one hit to hit a
cannon<00:04:12.250> but<00:04:12.519> if<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.630> shield's<00:04:13.959> if<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.200> let

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
cannon but if the shield's if you let

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.590 
cannon but if the shield's if you let
the<00:04:14.410> shield<00:04:14.620> recharge<00:04:15.010> then<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.239> you

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
the shield recharge then you can you

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.420 
the shield recharge then you can you
have<00:04:16.720> two<00:04:16.840> three<00:04:16.989> hit<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:17.470> if<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.980> Reavers

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
have two three hit it but if the Reavers

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.969 
have two three hit it but if the Reavers
attack<00:04:18.669> pretty<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.600> sync<00:04:20.530> with<00:04:20.650> each<00:04:20.710> other

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
attack pretty in sync with each other

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.730 
attack pretty in sync with each other
then<00:04:21.250> you'll<00:04:21.640> be<00:04:21.700> able<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:21.910> hit<00:04:22.210> cannons

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
then you'll be able to hit cannons

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.460 
then you'll be able to hit cannons
that's<00:04:22.949> that's<00:04:23.580> very<00:04:23.720> beneficial<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.259> now

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
that's that's very beneficial and now

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110 
that's that's very beneficial and now
I'm<00:04:25.560> getting<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:25.919> fat<00:04:26.190> an<00:04:26.400> expansion

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
I'm getting really fat an expansion

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.439 
I'm getting really fat an expansion
because<00:04:27.590> well<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.620> need<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.130> expand<00:04:29.460> that's<00:04:30.300> why

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
because well I need to expand that's why

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.850 
because well I need to expand that's why
I'm<00:04:30.569> good<00:04:30.780> running<00:04:31.020> low<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.199> minerals<00:04:31.560> um

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
I'm good running low on minerals um

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.930 
I'm good running low on minerals um
pretty<00:04:32.789> basic<00:04:33.000> but<00:04:33.210> yeah<00:04:34.199> I<00:04:34.639> pretty<00:04:35.639> sure<00:04:35.819> this

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
pretty basic but yeah I pretty sure this

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.189 
pretty basic but yeah I pretty sure this
push<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.210> gonna<00:04:36.360> win<00:04:36.539> me<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.750> game<00:04:36.900> either<00:04:37.050> way

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
push is gonna win me the game either way

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.040 
push is gonna win me the game either way
because<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.880> don't<00:04:38.880> see<00:04:39.000> him<00:04:39.210> defending<00:04:39.930> this

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
because I don't see him defending this

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.930 
because I don't see him defending this
because<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.530> have<00:04:40.710> well<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> have<00:04:41.580> too<00:04:41.759> much

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
because I have well I have too much

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.029 
because I have well I have too much
here<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.449> now<00:04:42.810> he's<00:04:42.990> getting<00:04:43.110> cannon<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:43.770> his

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039

I<00:04:44.250> think<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.120> canon<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.509> should<00:04:45.660> be<00:04:45.780> a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
I think it's a canon it should be a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.659 
I think it's a canon it should be a
cannon<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.229> he's<00:04:46.380> smart<00:04:46.500> now<00:04:47.280> he's<00:04:47.430> gonna<00:04:47.520> try

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
cannon if he's smart now he's gonna try

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.999 
cannon if he's smart now he's gonna try

and now i'm picking off that preserver
just<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:00.840> my<00:05:01.050> dt<00:05:01.349> can<00:05:01.530> come<00:05:01.710> up<00:05:01.830> here<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.210> kill

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
just so my dt can come up here and kill

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.700 
just so my dt can come up here and kill
the<00:05:03.330> cannons<00:05:03.690> or<00:05:03.870> whatever<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.470> hell<00:05:04.530> does

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
the cannons or whatever the hell does

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.649 
the cannons or whatever the hell does
building<00:05:05.069> over<00:05:05.250> there<00:05:05.370> yeah<00:05:06.090> as<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.419> see

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
building over there yeah as you can see

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.309 
building over there yeah as you can see
kind<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.620> smart<00:05:07.860> on<00:05:07.949> my<00:05:08.069> part<00:05:08.310> by<00:05:08.699> making<00:05:08.970> him

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
kind of smart on my part by making him

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.860 
kind of smart on my part by making him
oh<00:05:10.319> but<00:05:11.069> not<00:05:11.580> letting<00:05:11.880> him<00:05:11.970> build<00:05:12.449> cannons<00:05:12.780> up

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
oh but not letting him build cannons up

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.149 
oh but not letting him build cannons up
there<00:05:13.050> because<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.319> guess<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.800> wouldn't<00:05:13.949> cost

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
there because I guess it wouldn't cost

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.939 
there because I guess it wouldn't cost
me<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.400> game<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:14.789> it<00:05:15.000> would<00:05:15.150> significantly

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
me the game but it would significantly

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.700 
me the game but it would significantly
put<00:05:16.949> me<00:05:17.099> it'd<00:05:17.490> be<00:05:17.940> harder<00:05:18.210> for<00:05:18.240> me<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.530> kill<00:05:19.530> him

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
put me it'd be harder for me to kill him

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.129 
put me it'd be harder for me to kill him
if<00:05:19.889> he<00:05:20.039> had<00:05:20.159> Ken's<00:05:20.430> over<00:05:20.699> there<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.030> now<00:05:21.210> yeah

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
if he had Ken's over there and now yeah

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.659 
if he had Ken's over there and now yeah

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
because we both did really weird build

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.809 
because we both did really weird build
orders<00:06:06.569> and<00:06:07.250> generally<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.280> game<00:06:08.490> doesn't<00:06:08.759> go

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
orders and generally a game doesn't go

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.070 
orders and generally a game doesn't go
on<00:06:08.940> like<00:06:09.090> this<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:09.419> guess<00:06:09.569> this<00:06:09.690> game<00:06:09.870> to<00:06:09.960> show

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080

on like this I guess this game to show
you<00:06:10.229> how<00:06:10.319> to<00:06:10.380> defend<00:06:10.620> against<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.949> to<00:06:11.069> gate

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
you how to defend against the to gate

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.620 
you how to defend against the to gate
and<00:06:11.430> what<00:06:11.639> to<00:06:11.759> do<00:06:11.880> if<00:06:11.909> your<00:06:12.120> opponent<00:06:12.240> does<00:06:12.479> to

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
and what to do if your opponent does to

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.320
