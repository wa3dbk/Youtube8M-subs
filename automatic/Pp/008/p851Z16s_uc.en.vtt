00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
case and also some instruction manual

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.970 
case and also some instruction manual
just<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:17.080> but<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.650> don't<00:02:17.800> want<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
just here as well but we don't want to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.410 
just here as well but we don't want to
read<00:02:18.100> through<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> want<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.120> tell<00:02:19.270> you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420

read through that I want to tell you
about<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:20.080> myself<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> let's<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> look

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
about that myself so let's have a look

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.770 
about that myself so let's have a look
at<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.920> case<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.720> case

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
at the case so this is the case

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.809 
at the case so this is the case
right<00:02:27.770> down<00:02:27.950> at<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.130> bottom<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.640> can

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
right down at the bottom you can

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.480 
right down at the bottom you can
probably<00:02:29.030> see<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.110> do<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.980> incipio

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
probably see that you do get the incipio

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.760 
probably see that you do get the incipio
logo<00:02:31.940> engraved<00:02:32.180> into<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.780> case<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.709> do

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
logo engraved into the case and I do

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.190 
logo engraved into the case and I do
think<00:02:34.100> that's<00:02:34.280> quite<00:02:34.730> stylish<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:36.050> get

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
think that's quite stylish there you get

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370 
think that's quite stylish there you get
a<00:02:36.260> large<00:02:36.560> cutout<00:02:36.920> for<00:02:37.700> your<00:02:38.510> camera<00:02:38.750> flash<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
a large cutout for your camera flash and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.110 
a large cutout for your camera flash and
I<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.800> say<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.520> cutout<00:02:40.790> is

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
I have to say that this cutout is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.850 
I have to say that this cutout is
excellent<00:02:41.540> as<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.930> probably<00:02:42.140> tell<00:02:42.260> it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
excellent as you can probably tell it's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.340 
excellent as you can probably tell it's
got<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.100> black<00:02:43.459> inner<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.600> that's<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:45.080> that's

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
got a black inner so that's not that's

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.470 
got a black inner so that's not that's
going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.709> stop<00:02:46.040> any<00:02:46.370> camera<00:02:47.000> flash<00:02:47.239> being

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
going to stop any camera flash being

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.360 
going to stop any camera flash being
sucked<00:02:47.750> straight<00:02:48.260> back<00:02:48.530> into<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> lens<00:02:49.069> on

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
sucked straight back into the lens on

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.790 
sucked straight back into the lens on
the<00:02:49.880> inside<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.810> get<00:02:51.020> some<00:02:51.170> instructions

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
the inside you do get some instructions

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.680 
the inside you do get some instructions
on<00:02:51.950> how<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> charge<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.700> case<00:02:52.880> as<00:02:53.090> well<00:02:53.510> and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
on how to charge the case as well and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.229 
on how to charge the case as well and
how<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> fit<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.290> case<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.340> let's<00:02:55.730> insert<00:02:56.030> my

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
how to fit the case so let's insert my

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.930 
how to fit the case so let's insert my
iphone<00:02:56.660> 4s<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> make<00:02:58.880> sure

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
iphone 4s and you just have to make sure

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.870 
iphone 4s and you just have to make sure
that<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> grooves<00:02:59.810> are<00:03:00.410> improperly<00:03:00.920> slide<00:03:01.700> it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
that the grooves are improperly slide it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.900 
that the grooves are improperly slide it
down<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.300> then<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.350> fit<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.190> top<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> really

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
down and then just fit the top so really

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.290 
down and then just fit the top so really
quick<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.600> easy<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.380> install<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:11.030> is

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
quick and easy to install and this is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.100 
quick and easy to install and this is
the<00:03:11.540> iphone<00:03:11.660> 4<00:03:12.140> case<00:03:12.410> actually<00:03:13.130> on<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.660> iphone

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
the iphone 4 case actually on the iphone

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.530 
the iphone 4 case actually on the iphone
4<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.860> does<00:03:16.069> add<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.519> little<00:03:16.730> bit<00:03:16.940> extra<00:03:17.120> at

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
4 so it does add a little bit extra at

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.150 
4 so it does add a little bit extra at
the<00:03:17.690> bottom<00:03:17.989> but<00:03:18.440> that's<00:03:18.650> where<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.860> button

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the bottom but that's where the button

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.030 
the bottom but that's where the button
is<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.730> charge<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:21.200> hardly<00:03:21.560> ads<00:03:21.769> and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
is to charge it and it hardly ads and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.790 
is to charge it and it hardly ads and
think<00:03:22.459> in<00:03:22.670> thickness<00:03:23.450> at<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.350> case<00:03:24.530> i

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
think in thickness at all to the case i

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.630 
think in thickness at all to the case i
believe<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.580> only<00:03:25.730> makes<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.450> couple<00:03:26.900> of

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
believe it only makes it a couple of

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.090 
believe it only makes it a couple of
millimetres<00:03:28.640> thicker<00:03:29.269> this<00:03:29.959> is<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.590> special

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
millimetres thicker this is the special

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.490 
millimetres thicker this is the special
edition<00:03:31.299> gunmetal<00:03:32.299> grey<00:03:32.510> version<00:03:32.989> but<00:03:33.380> they

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
edition gunmetal grey version but they

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.259 
edition gunmetal grey version but they
also<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.519> black<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.000> there's<00:03:35.120> no

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
also do it in a black and there's no

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.569 
also do it in a black and there's no
price<00:03:35.540> difference<00:03:35.930> between<00:03:36.620> those<00:03:36.829> all<00:03:37.070> if<00:03:37.489> we

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
price difference between those all if we

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.370 
price difference between those all if we
have<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.730> look<00:03:37.850> at<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.030> bottom<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.780> do<00:03:38.930> get<00:03:39.170> a

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
go straight down and that jack port is

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.259 
go straight down and that jack port is
quite<00:04:18.380> thin<00:04:18.829> but<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.579> are<00:04:19.729> using<00:04:19.970> some

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
experience problems and that is the only

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.170 
experience problems and that is the only
bad<00:04:23.750> thing<00:04:24.080> about<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:24.890> case<00:04:25.130> now<00:04:25.820> they<00:04:26.120> do

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
bad thing about this case now they do

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.420 
bad thing about this case now they do
say<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.960> gives<00:04:27.110> two<00:04:27.380> times<00:04:27.680> charge<00:04:28.070> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
say that it gives two times charge and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.250 
say that it gives two times charge and
I've<00:04:28.820> actually<00:04:29.060> used<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.600> case<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.110> it

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
I've actually used this case and it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.719 
I've actually used this case and it
gives<00:04:30.500> from<00:04:31.780> 0<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.320> about<00:04:33.350> eighty<00:04:34.340> percent

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
gives from 0 to about eighty percent

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.450 
gives from 0 to about eighty percent
charge<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:35.690> near<00:04:35.960> enough<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.349> full<00:04:36.740> two<00:04:37.220> times

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
charge so near enough a full two times

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.460 
charge so near enough a full two times
charge<00:04:37.849> now<00:04:38.450> you<00:04:38.510> can<00:04:38.690> see<00:04:38.960> how<00:04:39.110> much<00:04:39.260> battery

charging mode and the lights flush up on

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.870 
charging mode and the lights flush up on
top<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:20.210> really<00:05:20.840> nice<00:05:21.020> design<00:05:21.410> if<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:22.160> want<00:05:22.610> to

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
top so really nice design if you want to

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.370 
top so really nice design if you want to
stop<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.300> from<00:05:23.390> charging<00:05:23.690> for<00:05:23.900> any<00:05:24.050> reason

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
stop it from charging for any reason

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.230 
stop it from charging for any reason
once<00:05:24.680> again<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.430> just<00:05:25.670> hold<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:25.970> buttons

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
once again you just hold the buttons

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.770 
once again you just hold the buttons
down<00:05:26.450> for<00:05:27.050> two<00:05:27.230> seconds<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:29.270> will<00:05:29.390> take<00:05:29.570> it

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
down for two seconds and it will take it

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.630 
down for two seconds and it will take it
straight<00:05:29.990> out<00:05:30.080> charge<00:05:30.470> mode<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.460> this

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
straight out charge mode so this

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.020 
straight out charge mode so this
probably<00:05:32.300> is<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.930> best<00:05:33.340> battery<00:05:34.340> cases<00:05:34.880> that

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
probably is the best battery cases that

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.540 
probably is the best battery cases that
I<00:05:35.060> have<00:05:35.330> used<00:05:35.660> it's<00:05:35.990> really<00:05:36.500> nice<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.040> thin<00:05:37.280> so

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
I have used it's really nice and thin so

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.580 
I have used it's really nice and thin so
you<00:05:37.640> could<00:05:37.880> use<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:38.270> all<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.480> time<00:05:38.660> hardly<00:05:39.500> add

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
you could use it all the time hardly add

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.400 
you could use it all the time hardly add
any<00:05:39.890> bulk<00:05:40.040> to<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.730> iphone<00:05:41.240> at<00:05:41.480> all<00:05:41.780> but<00:05:42.290> it

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
any bulk to the iphone at all but it

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.290 
any bulk to the iphone at all but it
does<00:05:42.620> add<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.890> little<00:05:43.130> bit<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.400> extra<00:05:44.090> length

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
does add a little bit of extra length
