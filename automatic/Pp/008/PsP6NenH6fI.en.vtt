00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
19 and 14 yeah a little bit of both

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
19 and 14 yeah a little bit of both
obviously<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> don't<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.730> want<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
obviously you don't you know we want to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.310 
obviously you don't you know we want to
finish<00:00:30.179> strong<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.869> always<00:00:31.080> talk<00:00:31.289> about

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
finish strong we always talk about

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920

finishing<00:00:31.920> strong<00:00:32.340> we've<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:33.329> able<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> do

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
finishing strong we've been able to do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.370 
finishing strong we've been able to do
that<00:00:34.219> historically<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:36.960> at

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that historically I think when I look at

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680 
that historically I think when I look at
it<00:00:37.530> bake<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.770> us<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.520> we've<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it bake for us you know we've got to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.040 
it bake for us you know we've got to
play<00:00:40.040> with<00:00:41.040> our<00:00:41.250> identity<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.210> our<00:00:42.329> core<00:00:42.600> which

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
play with our identity at our core which

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.660 
play with our identity at our core which
is<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> toughness<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.070> togetherness<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is the toughness and togetherness that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
is the toughness and togetherness that
we've<00:00:44.910> talked<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.570> day<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.320> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
we've talked about from day one when we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
we've talked about from day one when we
arrived<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.980> March<00:00:47.340> 2012<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.329> hasn't

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
arrived here March 2012 that hasn't

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.110 
arrived here March 2012 that hasn't
changed<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.280> last<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.730> games<00:00:51.000> not

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
changed and in the last two games not

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
changed and in the last two games not
really<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> last<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> last

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
really just the last one but the last

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
really just the last one but the last
two<00:00:52.949> games<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> didn't<00:00:53.789> feel<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.390> hit

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
two games I just didn't feel like we hit

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.950 
two games I just didn't feel like we hit
that<00:00:54.719> standard<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.739> threshold<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
that standard or that threshold of

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.330 
that standard or that threshold of
competitive<00:00:57.960> toughness<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> togetherness

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
competitive toughness and togetherness

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
competitive toughness and togetherness
that<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.910> need<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.350> play<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> obviously

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that we need to play well and obviously

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
that we need to play well and obviously

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
their way throughout the season you know
I've<00:01:36.630> said<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.170> been<00:01:37.320> well<00:01:37.500> documented

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I've said and it's been well documented

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
I've said and it's been well documented
probably<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.549> many<00:01:38.729> curveballs<00:01:39.180> collectively

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
probably as many curveballs collectively

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
probably as many curveballs collectively
as<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:41.159> had<00:01:41.369> total<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.299> six<00:01:42.570> years

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
as we had total in my first six years

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
as we had total in my first six years
you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.770> they<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.759> job<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you know so they they did a good job of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
you know so they they did a good job of
that<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.509> next<00:01:45.810> man<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.020> philosophy<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that the next man up philosophy you know

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.090 
that the next man up philosophy you know
you<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.850> beat<00:01:48.149> Baylor<00:01:48.840> Maryland<00:01:49.619> Purdue

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you don't beat Baylor Maryland Purdue

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
you don't beat Baylor Maryland Purdue
michigan<00:01:50.759> state<00:01:50.790> unless<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.869> playing

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
michigan state unless you're playing

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
michigan state unless you're playing
with<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.439> toughness<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> togetherness<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
with some toughness and togetherness and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
with some toughness and togetherness and
you<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.060> grit<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.570> mean<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you have a little grit to you mean you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.410 
you have a little grit to you mean you
just<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.149> showed

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just don't do that so I think we showed

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.389 
just don't do that so I think we showed
that<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> bulk<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> year<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.189> for

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that for the bulk of the year but for

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
that for the bulk of the year but for
whatever<00:01:59.579> reason<00:01:59.869> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.170> didn't<00:02:01.409> have

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
whatever reason you know we didn't have

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.359 
whatever reason you know we didn't have
that<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.439> immaterial<00:02:04.439> yet<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> very<00:02:05.070> end

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that that it immaterial yet the very end

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.770 
that that it immaterial yet the very end
and<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.850> we've<00:02:05.969> got<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> capture

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
and that's what we've got to capture

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
and that's what we've got to capture
again<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.350> way<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.560> capture<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
again I think the way you capture that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.660 
again I think the way you capture that
is<00:02:08.429> by<00:02:08.580> doing<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.119> every<00:02:09.629> day
