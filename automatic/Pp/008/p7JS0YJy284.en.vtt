originally<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> use<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> beta<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
originally when I use it on the beta I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
originally when I use it on the beta I
always<00:01:28.439> thought<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> salt<00:01:29.759> rifle<00:01:30.150> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
always thought it was a salt rifle but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.069 
always thought it was a salt rifle but
it's<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.780> large<00:01:31.170> machine<00:01:31.530> gun<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
it's actually a large machine gun and

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.280 
it's actually a large machine gun and
definitely<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.380> favorite<00:01:34.740> weapon<00:01:35.100> and

probably number two I would say probably

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.859 
probably number two I would say probably

not<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.280> recoil<00:01:50.790> shoots<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.950> know

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
not much recoil shoots a lot you know

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.069 
not much recoil shoots a lot you know
very<00:01:53.070> similar<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.030> gun<00:01:54.329> looks<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> lot

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
very similar to this gun looks a lot

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
very similar to this gun looks a lot
like<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.470> actually<00:01:55.619> two<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:57.060> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like it actually two which is kind of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
like it actually two which is kind of
funny<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.860> 31<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
funny but you do get I think 31 in the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.330 
funny but you do get I think 31 in the
clip<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.960> good<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.250> know

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
clip which is good it's you know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.709 
clip which is good it's you know
definitely<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.570> what

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
definitely that I think that's what

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.300 
definitely that I think that's what
holds<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.110> scar<00:02:04.380> back<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.829> being<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> great

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
holds the scar back from being a great

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
holds the scar back from being a great
weapon<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.299> lack<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> bullets<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
weapon is the lack of bullets in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
weapon is the lack of bullets in the
clip<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.069> having<00:02:08.399> only<00:02:08.670> 20<00:02:09.119> bullets<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
clip you know having only 20 bullets I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
clip you know having only 20 bullets I
mean<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.039> pretty<00:02:11.220> good

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
mean you have to have some pretty good

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.030 
mean you have to have some pretty good
accuracy<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:13.140> take<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:13.560> multiple

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
accuracy to to take out multiple

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
accuracy to to take out multiple
guys<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:14.969> gun<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.870> actually

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
guys but with this gun you can actually

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.229 
guys but with this gun you can actually
sit<00:02:16.500> down<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.519> look<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:17.939> sights

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
sit down and you know look down sights

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.809 
sit down and you know look down sights
and<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.689> kind<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.989> spray<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.469> thing<00:02:19.819> you

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
and just kind of spray this thing you

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.309 
and just kind of spray this thing you
know<00:02:20.909> if<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.299> large<00:02:21.569> group<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> enemies

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
know if you see a large group of enemies

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.619 
know if you see a large group of enemies
which<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.739> great<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.459> pick<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:23.909> some<00:02:24.090> double

kills and triple kills and stuff which

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.300 
kills and triple kills and stuff which
I've<00:02:26.219> done<00:02:27.319> but<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.530> far<00:02:28.709> yeah<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.189> my

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
I've done but so far yeah this is my

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.270 
I've done but so far yeah this is my
favorite<00:02:29.640> weapon<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.319> m416<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.829> close

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
favorite weapon with the m416 a close

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.599 
favorite weapon with the m416 a close
second<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.359> get<00:02:33.510> killed<00:02:33.750> by<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:33.989> there<00:02:34.609> which

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
second as I get killed by it there which

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.030 
second as I get killed by it there which
is<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> great<00:02:36.060> gun<00:02:36.329> but<00:02:36.599> i'll<00:02:37.049> admit<00:02:37.470> i<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:37.739> like

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
is a great gun but i'll admit i do like

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.099 
is a great gun but i'll admit i do like
the<00:02:38.069> scar<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:38.549> wasn't<00:02:39.359> really<00:02:39.450> digging<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> too

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
the scar I wasn't really digging it too

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.839 
the scar I wasn't really digging it too
much<00:02:40.319> until<00:02:40.739> i<00:02:40.769> unlock<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> holographic

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
much until i unlock the holographic

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.289 
much until i unlock the holographic
sight<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.920> i<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:44.310> i<00:02:44.430> put<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.730> silencer<00:02:45.239> on

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
sight and i think i put the silencer on

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.210 
sight and i think i put the silencer on
it<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.689> well<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.799> setup<00:02:47.040> i

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
it as well that's that's the setup i

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.309 
it as well that's that's the setup i
like<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.549> run<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> scar-h<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:48.900> it's

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
like to run with the scar-h and it's

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.050 
like to run with the scar-h and it's
definitely<00:02:49.920> helped<00:02:50.250> quite<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.549> bit<00:02:50.819> but

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
definitely helped quite a bit but

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.479 
definitely helped quite a bit but
speaking<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.169> the<00:02:52.290> holographic<00:02:52.680> sights<00:02:53.099> by

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
speaking of the holographic sights by

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.920 
speaking of the holographic sights by
far<00:02:53.909> I<00:02:54.919> think<00:02:55.919> you<00:02:56.639> know<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.939> just<00:02:57.299> by<00:02:57.629> far

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
far I think you know it's just by far

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.009 
far I think you know it's just by far
the<00:02:58.139> best<00:02:58.349> attachment<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.069> game<00:02:59.540> for<00:03:00.540> me<00:03:00.569> I

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the best attachment in the game for me I

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.750 
the best attachment in the game for me I
don't<00:03:01.260> know<00:03:01.349> if<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.310> mental<00:03:02.579> thing

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
don't know if it's just a mental thing

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.640 
don't know if it's just a mental thing
or<00:03:03.209> if<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.870> actually<00:03:04.049> true<00:03:04.290> but

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
or if you know this is actually true but

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.860 
or if you know this is actually true but
it<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:04.919> makes<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.370> huge<00:03:05.760> difference<00:03:06.180> no

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it just makes a huge difference no

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.309 
it just makes a huge difference no
matter<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.409> I<00:03:07.439> put<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:08.180> attachment<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.569> it

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
matter what I put this attachment on it

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.190 
matter what I put this attachment on it
just<00:03:10.650> makes<00:03:10.950> me<00:03:11.159> and<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:12.030> gun<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.720> much<00:03:12.930> better

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
just makes me and the gun so much better

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
just makes me and the gun so much better
I<00:03:13.290> don't<00:03:13.799> know<00:03:13.889> what<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.159> is<00:03:14.189> you<00:03:14.639> know

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
I don't know what it is you know

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.949 
I don't know what it is you know
obviously<00:03:14.909> I<00:03:15.209> don't<00:03:15.299> think<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.629> adds<00:03:15.780> any

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
obviously I don't think it adds any

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.020 
obviously I don't think it adds any
power<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> or<00:03:16.739> anything<00:03:16.919> like<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:17.639> I

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
power to it or anything like that but I

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.270 
power to it or anything like that but I
don't<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:19.049> with<00:03:19.260> some<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> other<00:03:19.650> optics

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
don't know with some of the other optics

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
don't know with some of the other optics
like<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.000> red<00:03:21.209> dot<00:03:21.419> sights<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.139> some<00:03:22.349> of<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
like the red dot sights and some of the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.979 
like the red dot sights and some of the
ACOG<00:03:22.859> scope<00:03:22.889> sit<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:23.819> your<00:03:24.359> gun<00:03:24.629> really

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
ACOG scope sit really your gun really

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.020 
ACOG scope sit really your gun really
kicks<00:03:25.349> up<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.889> air<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.609> really<00:03:26.790> makes

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
kicks up in the air and it really makes

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.149 
kicks up in the air and it really makes
it<00:03:27.209> tough<00:03:27.419> especially<00:03:27.930> at<00:03:28.229> long<00:03:28.409> distance<00:03:28.919> to

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
it tough especially at long distance to

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.640 
it tough especially at long distance to
the<00:03:29.430> kind<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.239> burst<00:03:30.449> fire<00:03:30.720> guys<00:03:31.079> or<00:03:31.379> you<00:03:31.500> have

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the kind of burst fire guys or you have

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.439 
the kind of burst fire guys or you have
to<00:03:31.769> concentrate<00:03:32.340> more<00:03:32.579> on<00:03:32.790> burst<00:03:33.090> fire<00:03:33.299> you

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
to concentrate more on burst fire you

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.000 
to concentrate more on burst fire you
can't<00:03:33.569> really<00:03:33.780> spray<00:03:34.199> because<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.560> kicks<00:03:34.799> all

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
can't really spray because it kicks all

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.979 
can't really spray because it kicks all
over<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> place<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.449> like<00:03:36.659> about<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
over the place and so I like about the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.430 
over the place and so I like about the
m416<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.949> them<00:03:38.040> 27<00:03:38.729> is<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.479> it<00:03:40.109> shoots

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
m416 and them 27 is just it shoots

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.080 
m416 and them 27 is just it shoots
pretty<00:03:40.739> straight<00:03:41.129> and<00:03:41.400> especially<00:03:41.849> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
pretty straight and especially the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.149 
pretty straight and especially the
holographic<00:03:42.510> side<00:03:42.870> it's<00:03:43.169> just<00:03:43.829> really

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
holographic side it's just really

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.909 
holographic side it's just really
accurate<00:03:45.049> both<00:03:46.049> guns<00:03:46.349> have<00:03:46.560> pretty<00:03:46.769> good

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
accurate both guns have pretty good

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.649 
accurate both guns have pretty good
power<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.459> them<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.669> seems<00:03:47.909> like<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.419> I

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
power to them it seems like and I

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.309 
power to them it seems like and I
definitely<00:03:49.590> enjoy<00:03:50.099> those<00:03:50.310> guns<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.299> most<00:03:51.510> but

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
definitely enjoy those guns the most but

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.990 
definitely enjoy those guns the most but
i<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.739> pretty<00:03:53.040> funny<00:03:53.280> sequence<00:03:53.549> here

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
i think this pretty funny sequence here

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.020 
i think this pretty funny sequence here
get<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.139> guy<00:03:55.379> after<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> bunch<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.310> sprays<00:03:56.669> and

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
get that guy after a bunch of sprays and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.569 
get that guy after a bunch of sprays and
i<00:03:57.689> saw<00:03:58.379> that<00:03:58.530> guy<00:03:58.709> laying<00:03:58.979> on<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.189> ground<00:03:59.400> he

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
i saw that guy laying on the ground he

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.629 
i saw that guy laying on the ground he
popped<00:03:59.849> up<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.329> luckily<00:04:01.049> got<00:04:01.650> him<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.159> then<00:04:02.310> i

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
popped up and luckily got him and then i

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.369

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and I never used if she what the hell is

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.520 
and I never used if she what the hell is
that<00:04:14.180> Jesus<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.359> was<00:04:15.389> scary<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.199> somebody

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
that Jesus that was scary but somebody

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.110 
that Jesus that was scary but somebody
was<00:04:16.650> trying<00:04:16.949> to<00:04:17.039> break<00:04:17.159> into<00:04:17.430> my<00:04:17.609> room<00:04:17.639> there

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
was trying to break into my room there

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.589 
was trying to break into my room there
but<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.449> think<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.930> was<00:04:19.019> just<00:04:19.139> my<00:04:19.320> dog<00:04:19.530> upstairs

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
but I think it was just my dog upstairs

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.589 
but I think it was just my dog upstairs
goofy<00:04:21.599> moment<00:04:22.130> um<00:04:23.130> where<00:04:23.430> was<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.880> yeah<00:04:24.389> talking

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
goofy moment um where was I yeah talking

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.149 
goofy moment um where was I yeah talking
about<00:04:24.779> the<00:04:24.870> knife<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.830> weapon<00:04:26.099> I

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
about the knife that's a weapon I

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.530 
about the knife that's a weapon I
definitely<00:04:26.669> don't<00:04:26.849> use<00:04:27.120> very

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
definitely don't use very

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.080 
definitely don't use very
and<00:04:27.900> uh<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.470> think<00:04:28.920> they<00:04:29.250> really<00:04:29.610> need<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.820> patch

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
and uh I think they really need to patch

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.600 
and uh I think they really need to patch
the<00:04:30.360> knife<00:04:30.540> it's<00:04:31.440> not<00:04:31.650> overpowered<00:04:32.280> by<00:04:32.340> any

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
the knife it's not overpowered by any

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.030 
the knife it's not overpowered by any
means<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.540> it<00:04:33.660> seems<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.200> work<00:04:34.410> fine<00:04:34.710> when<00:04:34.950> you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
means and it seems to work fine when you

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.890 
means and it seems to work fine when you
come<00:04:35.250> up<00:04:35.400> behind<00:04:35.550> guys<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.390> know<00:04:36.510> do<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
come up behind guys and you know do the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.070 
come up behind guys and you know do the
cool<00:04:37.200> knifing<00:04:37.710> animations<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:39.080> sometimes

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
cool knifing animations but sometimes

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.630 
cool knifing animations but sometimes
when<00:04:40.590> you're<00:04:40.710> trying<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.950> do<00:04:41.100> those<00:04:41.280> swipe

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
when you're trying to do those swipe

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.450 
when you're trying to do those swipe
knifes<00:04:41.940> they<00:04:42.270> just<00:04:42.510> don't<00:04:42.720> work<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.740> don't<00:04:44.160> know

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
knifes they just don't work I don't know

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.890 
knifes they just don't work I don't know
what<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.760> problem<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.240> but<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.510> definitely

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
what the problem is but I definitely

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.340 
what the problem is but I definitely
think<00:04:46.170> they<00:04:46.350> need<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.590> patch<00:04:46.800> those<00:04:48.200> let's<00:04:49.200> get

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
think they need to patch those let's get

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
m4 that's a gun I really don't I really

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.380 
m4 that's a gun I really don't I really
didn't<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.830> what<00:05:05.190> very<00:05:05.430> much<00:05:05.670> it<00:05:05.910> wasn't

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
didn't like what very much it wasn't

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.530 
didn't like what very much it wasn't
very<00:05:06.480> powerful<00:05:07.070> fairly<00:05:08.070> accurate<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:08.880> god<00:05:09.510> I

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
very powerful fairly accurate but god I

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.480 
very powerful fairly accurate but god I
was<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.020> was<00:05:10.140> really<00:05:10.470> not<00:05:10.590> liking<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:11.220> when<00:05:11.460> I

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
was I was really not liking it when I

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.630 
was I was really not liking it when I
had<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.820> red<00:05:12.780> dot<00:05:12.990> sight<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.920> think<00:05:14.520> I

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
had the red dot sight and I think I

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.230 
had the red dot sight and I think I
almost<00:05:14.850> get<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.090> triple<00:05:15.450> kill<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:17.030> yeah<00:05:18.030> that

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
almost get a triple kill here yeah that

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.410 
almost get a triple kill here yeah that
was<00:05:18.330> pretty<00:05:18.480> close<00:05:18.750> um<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:20.190> really<00:05:21.120> was<00:05:21.270> not

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
was pretty close um I really was not

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.330 
was pretty close um I really was not
liking<00:05:21.870> with<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.110> red<00:05:22.290> dot<00:05:22.470> sight<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.130> some

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
liking with the red dot sight and some

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.880 
liking with the red dot sight and some
of<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.460> ACOG<00:05:23.820> scopes<00:05:24.590> really<00:05:25.590> was<00:05:25.740> not

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
of the ACOG scopes really was not

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.530 
of the ACOG scopes really was not
digging<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.700> then<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:26.910> unlocked<00:05:27.330> the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
digging it and then I unlocked the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.170 
digging it and then I unlocked the
holographic<00:05:28.380> sight<00:05:28.740> man<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.310> that

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
holographic sight man and that

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.840 
holographic sight man and that
attachment<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.050> just<00:05:31.230> crazy<00:05:31.560> how<00:05:31.710> how<00:05:32.700> it

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
attachment it it's just crazy how how it

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.480 
attachment it it's just crazy how how it
affects<00:05:33.180> at<00:05:33.600> least<00:05:33.840> my<00:05:34.020> gameplay<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:35.400> know

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
affects at least my gameplay you know

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.510 
affects at least my gameplay you know
makes<00:05:35.730> me<00:05:35.910> so<00:05:36.090> much<00:05:36.240> better<00:05:36.950> makes<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.100> gun<00:05:38.310> so

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
makes me so much better makes a gun so

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.250 
makes me so much better makes a gun so
much<00:05:38.700> better<00:05:38.940> in<00:05:39.090> my<00:05:39.210> opinion<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.750> don't<00:05:40.200> know

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
much better in my opinion I don't know

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.600 
much better in my opinion I don't know
if<00:05:40.350> you<00:05:40.440> guys<00:05:40.560> agree<00:05:40.770> with<00:05:40.950> that<00:05:41.100> too<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.490> can

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
if you guys agree with that too you can

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.160 
if you guys agree with that too you can
put<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.880> comments<00:05:42.420> if<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.600> guys<00:05:42.750> notice

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
put that comments if you guys notice

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.680 
put that comments if you guys notice
that<00:05:43.350> as<00:05:43.440> well<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.940> compared<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.510> all<00:05:45.660> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
that as well but compared to all the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.240 
that as well but compared to all the
other<00:05:45.840> optics<00:05:46.440> I<00:05:46.590> mean<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.830> holographic

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
other optics I mean the holographic

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.030 
other optics I mean the holographic
sight<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.760> just<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.360> far<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.050> away<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.260> best<00:05:49.650> in

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
sight is just a far and away the best in

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.690 
sight is just a far and away the best in
my<00:05:50.670> opinion<00:05:50.700> at<00:05:51.180> least<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:53.310> know<00:05:53.400> same<00:05:53.670> thing

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
my opinion at least you know same thing

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.670 
my opinion at least you know same thing
happened<00:05:53.880> with<00:05:54.240> the<00:05:54.360> scar<00:05:54.660> you<00:05:55.050> know<00:05:55.170> pop<00:05:55.470> the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
happened with the scar you know pop the

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.090 
happened with the scar you know pop the
holographic<00:05:56.640> on<00:05:56.910> their<00:05:57.120> made<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.330> lot<00:05:57.600> better

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
holographic on their made a lot better

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.340 
holographic on their made a lot better
and<00:05:59.420> was<00:06:00.420> another<00:06:00.600> gun<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:01.020> had<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.170> big

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
and was another gun that had a big

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.960 
and was another gun that had a big
effect<00:06:01.500> on<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.940> saw<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.770> 249<00:06:04.970> definitely

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
effect on the the saw the 249 definitely

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.690 
effect on the the saw the 249 definitely
made<00:06:06.120> a<00:06:06.150> huge<00:06:06.540> difference<00:06:06.780> for<00:06:07.050> me<00:06:07.670> you<00:06:08.670> know

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
made a huge difference for me you know

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.540 
made a huge difference for me you know
the<00:06:09.080> iron<00:06:10.080> sights<00:06:10.440> at<00:06:10.680> hello<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.340> gun

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
the iron sights at hello that the gun

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.400 
the iron sights at hello that the gun
kind<00:06:11.790> of<00:06:11.850> just<00:06:12.060> kicks<00:06:12.660> all<00:06:12.870> over<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.170> place

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
kind of just kicks all over the place

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.160 
kind of just kicks all over the place
but<00:06:13.620> it<00:06:13.770> is<00:06:13.920> pretty<00:06:14.100> powerful<00:06:14.520> so<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:15.540> know<00:06:15.660> it

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
but it is pretty powerful so you know it

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.500 
but it is pretty powerful so you know it
was<00:06:16.230> pretty<00:06:16.890> balanced<00:06:17.700> but<00:06:17.910> then<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.150> pop<00:06:18.360> the

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
was pretty balanced but then you pop the

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.480 
was pretty balanced but then you pop the
holographic<00:06:18.960> sight<00:06:19.320> on<00:06:19.470> their<00:06:19.680> made<00:06:20.310> that

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
holographic sight on their made that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.000 
holographic sight on their made that
thing<00:06:20.670> so<00:06:20.910> much<00:06:21.060> more<00:06:21.270> accurate<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.050> that's

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
thing so much more accurate and that's

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.620 
thing so much more accurate and that's
definitely<00:06:23.160> one<00:06:23.520> of<00:06:23.550> my<00:06:23.640> favorite<00:06:23.970> guns<00:06:24.180> it's

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
definitely one of my favorite guns it's

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.320 
definitely one of my favorite guns it's
the<00:06:25.530> saw<00:06:25.770> with<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.550> holographic<00:06:27.000> set<00:06:27.300> i

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
the saw with the the holographic set i

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.790 
the saw with the the holographic set i
think<00:06:27.570> are<00:06:27.660> going<00:06:27.900> pretty<00:06:28.020> nice<00:06:28.290> little<00:06:28.560> tear

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
think are going pretty nice little tear

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
think are going pretty nice little tear
here<00:06:29.180> probably<00:06:30.180> get<00:06:30.390> killed<00:06:30.600> pretty<00:06:30.960> soon<00:06:31.820> but

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
here probably get killed pretty soon but

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.220 
here probably get killed pretty soon but
yeah<00:06:32.970> I<00:06:33.000> was<00:06:33.360> definitely<00:06:33.540> kicking<00:06:33.840> some<00:06:34.110> ass

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
yeah I was definitely kicking some ass

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.890 
yeah I was definitely kicking some ass
in<00:06:34.290> this<00:06:34.590> in<00:06:34.830> this<00:06:35.040> match<00:06:35.280> but<00:06:35.390> yeah<00:06:36.390> I<00:06:36.810> mean

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
in this in this match but yeah I mean

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
in this in this match but yeah I mean
the<00:06:37.890> holographic<00:06:38.669> sight

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
the holographic sight

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.850 
the holographic sight
it<00:06:40.610> is<00:06:40.880> definitely<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.390> best<00:06:41.570> attachment<00:06:42.260> the

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
it is definitely the best attachment the

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.060 
it is definitely the best attachment the
suppressor<00:06:43.400> for<00:06:43.610> most<00:06:43.820> guns<00:06:44.090> is<00:06:44.300> pretty<00:06:44.540> good

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
suppressor for most guns is pretty good

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.890 
suppressor for most guns is pretty good
the<00:06:46.070> heavy<00:06:46.280> barrel<00:06:46.520> I<00:06:46.760> like<00:06:47.030> quite<00:06:47.300> a<00:06:47.330> bit<00:06:47.570> and

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
the heavy barrel I like quite a bit and

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.620 
the heavy barrel I like quite a bit and
the<00:06:48.800> extended<00:06:49.280> magazines<00:06:49.760> is<00:06:49.940> another<00:06:50.450> great

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
the extended magazines is another great

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.620 
the extended magazines is another great
one<00:06:50.870> to<00:06:51.110> nothing<00:06:51.350> wrong<00:06:51.620> with<00:06:51.800> that<00:06:52.540> and<00:06:53.540> I

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
one to nothing wrong with that and I

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.630 
one to nothing wrong with that and I
found<00:06:53.840> out<00:06:54.050> today<00:06:54.230> also<00:06:54.530> with<00:06:54.980> a<00:06:55.220> couple<00:06:55.580> of

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
found out today also with a couple of

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.830 
found out today also with a couple of
guns<00:06:55.910> the<00:06:56.210> the<00:06:56.650> pp-2000<00:06:57.650> and<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.430> and<00:06:59.210> the<00:06:59.330> UMP

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
guns the the pp-2000 and the and the UMP

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.780 
guns the the pp-2000 and the and the UMP
they're<00:07:00.110> both<00:07:00.290> going<00:07:00.500> to<00:07:00.560> be<00:07:00.650> getting<00:07:01.010> they're

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
they're both going to be getting they're

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.070 
they're both going to be getting they're
both<00:07:02.090> going<00:07:02.330> to<00:07:02.390> be<00:07:02.450> part<00:07:02.750> of<00:07:02.780> the<00:07:02.900> patch

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
both going to be part of the patch

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.920 
both going to be part of the patch
that's<00:07:03.380> coming<00:07:03.710> out<00:07:03.860> soon<00:07:04.750> they<00:07:05.750> actually

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
that's coming out soon they actually

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.290 
that's coming out soon they actually
nerf<00:07:06.380> the<00:07:06.620> UMP<00:07:07.100> pretty<00:07:07.520> badly<00:07:07.790> and<00:07:08.120> that<00:07:08.210> was

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
nerf the UMP pretty badly and that was

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.000 
nerf the UMP pretty badly and that was
one<00:07:08.390> of<00:07:08.450> my<00:07:08.600> favorite<00:07:08.930> guns<00:07:09.200> in<00:07:09.410> me<00:07:09.560> and<00:07:09.890> the

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
one of my favorite guns in me and the

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.860 
one of my favorite guns in me and the
