00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
think that maybe 10 years ago this would

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.380 
think that maybe 10 years ago this would
have<00:01:24.690> been<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.320> bleeding-edge<00:01:25.740> nowadays

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
have been really bleeding-edge nowadays

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
have been really bleeding-edge nowadays

we'll get to the actual details of this

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
we'll get to the actual details of this
is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> consumer<00:01:30.030> electronics<00:01:30.540> gadget<00:01:30.930> but

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
is a consumer electronics gadget but

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
is a consumer electronics gadget but
essentially<00:01:31.830> let<00:01:32.400> me<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.640> show<00:01:32.760> you<00:01:32.820> this

that which you completely don't need its

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.990 
that which you completely don't need its
commit<00:02:02.760> standard<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.520> media

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
commit standard you just get the media

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
commit standard you just get the media
and<00:02:07.129> ultimately<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> problem<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.910> this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and ultimately the problem with this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.559 
and ultimately the problem with this
device<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:10.760> multiple<00:02:11.760> things<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
device is multiple things one is that

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.410

right

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.059 
right
at<00:02:18.900> least<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.379> know<00:02:19.409> if<00:02:19.739> you're<00:02:19.890> wearing

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
right right yeah so that's a terrible

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.000 
right right yeah so that's a terrible
glasses<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> terrible<00:02:27.299> device<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.230> being

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
glasses a terrible device for being

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
glasses a terrible device for being
sneaky<00:02:29.189> this<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.639> actually<00:02:29.999> a<00:02:30.030> pretty<00:02:30.269> sneaky

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
device and for that reason it's probably

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.640 
device and for that reason it's probably
not<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.299> idea<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.870> use<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.079> if<00:02:34.499> you're

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
not a good idea to use it if you're
