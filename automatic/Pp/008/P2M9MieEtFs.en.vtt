eight gigabytes of storage but you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.420 
eight gigabytes of storage but you can
expand<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> microSD<00:01:07.380> card<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.130> hope<00:01:08.310> you

little bit of weight to it which is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.749 
little bit of weight to it which is
expected<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> course<00:01:29.040> when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.460> five

thicker<00:04:20.590> battery<00:04:20.979> than<00:04:21.100> you're<00:04:21.280> used<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
thicker battery than you're used to I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.830 
thicker battery than you're used to I
believe<00:04:21.820> it's<00:04:21.940> 10<00:04:22.090> millimeters<00:04:22.479> but<00:04:22.600> it's<00:04:22.720> not

believe it's 10 millimeters but it's not
really<00:04:23.110> it's<00:04:23.229> because<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.560> thought<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.800> would

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
really it's because I thought it would

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.680 
really it's because I thought it would
five<00:04:24.370> thousand<00:04:24.730> million<00:04:24.970> bar<00:04:25.120> batteries<00:04:25.570> so

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
five thousand million bar batteries so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.730

later<00:04:34.390> again<00:04:34.810> like<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.080> said<00:04:35.140> offload<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> full

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
later again like I said offload a full

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.400 
later again like I said offload a full
review<00:04:36.870> soon<00:04:37.870> enough

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
review soon enough

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.410 
review soon enough
so<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.710> typical<00:04:38.950> Start<00:04:39.400> screen<00:04:39.520> make<00:04:40.090> yourself

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
so a typical Start screen make yourself

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.600 
so a typical Start screen make yourself
at<00:04:40.540> home<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.020> don't<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.890> asks<00:04:42.220> for<00:04:42.370> me<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
at home I don't think it asks for me to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.490 
at home I don't think it asks for me to
sign<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.120> guess<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.540> would<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:43.960> I<00:04:44.110> would<00:04:44.410> have

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
sign I guess it would if I would have

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
you'll see under battery settings you

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.780 
you'll see under battery settings you
can<00:07:06.590> put<00:07:06.800> battery<00:07:07.040> percentage<00:07:07.220> up<00:07:07.610> there

which<00:07:07.970> I'll<00:07:08.120> probably<00:07:08.300> do<00:07:08.510> so<00:07:08.660> I<00:07:08.720> can<00:07:08.900> get<00:07:09.020> a

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
which I'll probably do so I can get a

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.440 
which I'll probably do so I can get a
gauge<00:07:09.530> and<00:07:09.560> idea<00:07:10.010> of<00:07:10.100> how<00:07:10.250> long<00:07:10.460> standby<00:07:11.090> takes

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
gauge and idea of how long standby takes

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.130 
gauge and idea of how long standby takes
all<00:07:11.750> that<00:07:11.930> stuff<00:07:12.400> I<00:07:13.400> was<00:07:14.270> hoping<00:07:14.900> it<00:07:15.020> would

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
all that stuff I was hoping it would

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.560 
all that stuff I was hoping it would
give<00:07:15.410> me<00:07:15.680> an<00:07:15.830> estimate<00:07:16.130> of<00:07:16.760> how<00:07:17.030> much<00:07:17.240> longer

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
give me an estimate of how much longer

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.200 
give me an estimate of how much longer
it<00:07:17.810> would<00:07:17.930> it<00:07:18.830> would<00:07:18.950> last<00:07:19.250> but<00:07:19.700> it<00:07:19.880> doesn't

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
it would it would last but it doesn't

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.540 
it would it would last but it doesn't
