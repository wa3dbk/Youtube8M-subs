00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
and also the fact that he is medium

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.790 
and also the fact that he is medium
attacking<00:02:38.090> low<00:02:38.300> defensive<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.110> would<00:02:39.500> like<00:02:39.650> him

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
attacking low defensive I would like him

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.290 
attacking low defensive I would like him
to<00:02:39.830> be<00:02:39.950> higher<00:02:40.250> attacking<00:02:40.760> especially<00:02:41.209> when

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
to be higher attacking especially when

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.120 
to be higher attacking especially when
he's<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.599> far<00:02:41.870> up<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.110> pitch<00:02:42.319> as<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.040> can

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
he's that far up the pitch as you can

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.770 
he's that far up the pitch as you can
see<00:02:43.310> reasonable<00:02:43.880> sprint<00:02:44.209> speed<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
see reasonable sprint speed and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.300 
see reasonable sprint speed and
acceleration<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.800> he<00:02:45.890> does<00:02:46.040> move

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
acceleration on them and he does move

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.699 
acceleration on them and he does move
fairly<00:02:46.819> quickly<00:02:47.000> across<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.989> ground<00:02:48.350> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
fairly quickly across the ground and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.670 
fairly quickly across the ground and
looking<00:02:49.700> at<00:02:49.940> here<00:02:50.209> we've<00:02:50.390> got<00:02:50.420> pace<00:02:50.750> placement

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
looking at here we've got pace placement

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.729 
looking at here we've got pace placement
and<00:02:51.830> shot<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.120> as<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.569> see<00:02:53.840> great<00:02:54.260> pace<00:02:54.530> on

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
and shot so as you can see great pace on

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:55.840 
and shot so as you can see great pace on
them<00:02:54.860> they're<00:02:54.980> just<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.340> saved<00:02:55.610> by<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
them they're just get saved by the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.750 
them they're just get saved by the
keeper<00:02:56.319> but<00:02:57.319> look<00:02:57.500> at<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:58.100> totally<00:02:58.370> out

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
keeper but look at this just totally out

the<00:03:03.500> post<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.400> gives<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:04.610> an<00:03:04.730> idea<00:03:04.819> of

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
the post so that gives you an idea of

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.000 
the post so that gives you an idea of
where<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.299> pace<00:03:05.569> comes<00:03:05.930> into<00:03:06.260> play<00:03:06.440> those<00:03:06.709> two

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
where the pace comes into play those two

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.370 
where the pace comes into play those two
stats<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.519> acceleration<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:09.200> other

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
stats the acceleration and the other

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.199 
stats the acceleration and the other
stats<00:03:09.709> but<00:03:09.950> let's<00:03:10.099> have<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> look<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:10.640> some<00:03:11.150> more

right<00:05:14.830> in<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.130> top<00:05:15.340> corner<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.270> is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
right in the top corner and it is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.360 
right in the top corner and it is
difficult<00:05:16.660> for<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.260> keeper<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.890> get<00:05:18.130> across

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
difficult for the keeper to get across

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.150 
difficult for the keeper to get across
and<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.940> do<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.120> save<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.230> really<00:05:20.770> like<00:05:20.920> him

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
and to do a save so I really like him

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920 
and to do a save so I really like him
for<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.400> let's<00:05:21.790> have<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> look<00:05:22.180> at<00:05:22.360> his<00:05:22.570> cone

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
for that let's have a look at his cone

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.250 
for that let's have a look at his cone
to<00:05:23.290> start<00:05:23.650> weak<00:05:24.070> foot<00:05:24.630> lacking<00:05:25.630> in<00:05:25.810> strength

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
to start weak foot lacking in strength

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.420 
to start weak foot lacking in strength
and<00:05:26.500> left<00:05:27.490> footed<00:05:28.120> on<00:05:28.480> the<00:05:28.720> left<00:05:28.930> hand<00:05:29.230> side

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
and left footed on the left hand side

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.710 
and left footed on the left hand side
great<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.580> crossing<00:05:31.060> don't<00:05:31.300> get<00:05:31.420> me<00:05:31.540> wrong

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
great the crossing don't get me wrong

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.810 
great the crossing don't get me wrong
but<00:05:31.750> his<00:05:32.050> crossing<00:05:32.440> isn't<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.860> great<00:05:33.130> he

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
but his crossing isn't that great he

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.580 
but his crossing isn't that great he
looking<00:05:34.330> at<00:05:34.420> to<00:05:34.570> getting<00:05:34.840> this<00:05:34.960> guy<00:05:35.200> as<00:05:35.470> an

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
looking at to getting this guy as an

honest<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.350> really<00:05:38.610> affected<00:05:39.610> me<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.790> fact

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
honest it really affected me the fact

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.640 
honest it really affected me the fact
that<00:05:40.300> he<00:05:40.390> was<00:05:40.540> left<00:05:40.780> footed<00:05:40.990> on<00:05:41.200> the<00:05:41.320> left<00:05:41.470> hand

use<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.800> kale<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.250> know<00:05:51.970> when<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> Charlie<00:05:52.510> did

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
use the kale I know when a Charlie did

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.690 
use the kale I know when a Charlie did
his<00:05:52.780> review<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:53.560> he<00:05:53.710> basically<00:05:54.100> switched<00:05:54.520> him

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
his review and he basically switched him

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
position and for me it just didn't cut

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.969 
position and for me it just didn't cut
it<00:06:37.330> and<00:06:37.540> unfortunately<00:06:37.780> that<00:06:38.470> is<00:06:38.590> why<00:06:38.770> he's

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979

it's<00:06:43.539> just<00:06:43.840> tread<00:06:44.199> carefully<00:06:44.440> because<00:06:44.860> you

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
it's just tread carefully because you

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.800 
it's just tread carefully because you
