crap<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.620> what<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.160> guessing<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.480> really

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
crap is what I'm guessing it's really

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.450 
crap is what I'm guessing it's really
interesting<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
interesting because when I first got it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
interesting because when I first got it
it<00:00:41.610> didn't<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> display<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it didn't have a display and I was like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
it didn't have a display and I was like
wait<00:00:43.590> how<00:00:43.920> am<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> supposed<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> find<00:00:44.520> anything

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
wait how am I supposed to find anything

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
wait how am I supposed to find anything
but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.660> guess<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.530> display<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but I guess the display is like one of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.180 
but I guess the display is like one of
these<00:00:47.879> weird<00:00:48.469> like<00:00:49.469> look<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> goes

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
these weird like look at that it goes

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.529 
these weird like look at that it goes
through<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.940> plastic<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.539> it's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
through the plastic so it's like it's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
through the plastic so it's like it's
it's<00:00:54.840> weird<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.489> didn't<00:00:57.090> even

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
kind of they need to figure that out
that's<00:01:42.810> pretty<00:01:43.380> lame<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that's pretty lame and the thing that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
that's pretty lame and the thing that
that<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:45.270> you're<00:01:45.420> charging<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> backwards

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that when you're charging it backwards

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.740 
that when you're charging it backwards
if<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.220> didn't<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.520> google<00:01:47.729> around<00:01:48.180> I'd<00:01:48.390> say

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
if I didn't have google around I'd say

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.770 
if I didn't have google around I'd say
yeah<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> thing's<00:01:49.350> broken<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.340> know

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
yeah this thing's broken you know

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
yeah this thing's broken you know
because<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> fits<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> charger<00:01:53.070> both<00:01:53.250> both

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because it fits on the charger both both

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.080 
because it fits on the charger both both
ways<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:55.439> comes<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.100> belt

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
ways so it comes with this little belt

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020 
ways so it comes with this little belt
clip<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.990> some<00:01:58.170> reason<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> need<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> even

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
clip for some reason if you need it even

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789 
clip for some reason if you need it even
though<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.149> already<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.930> designed<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
though it already it's designed just to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
though it already it's designed just to
kind<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> clip<00:02:02.340> already<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.939> yeah<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> guess

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
kind of clip already but yeah I guess

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.760 
kind of clip already but yeah I guess
this<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.049> belt<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:05.549> comes<00:02:05.820> with<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
this is for your belt it comes with a a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
this is for your belt it comes with a a
Velcro<00:02:07.770> pad<00:02:08.429> thing<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.360> at

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
Velcro pad thing that you put on at

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.380 
Velcro pad thing that you put on at
night<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:11.640> sleeping<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
night so when you're sleeping you have

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.320 
night so when you're sleeping you have
this<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.810> arm

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
this on your arm

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.440 
this on your arm
so<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.720> track<00:02:13.960> when<00:02:14.440> you're<00:02:14.590> sleeping<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so it can track when you're sleeping it

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.830 
so it can track when you're sleeping it
also<00:02:16.630> has<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:18.040> believe<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> docking

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
also has a I believe this is a docking

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.040 
also has a I believe this is a docking
station<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.800> charger<00:02:21.220> which<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:22.150> guess<00:02:22.930> I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
station for the charger which I guess I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.820 
station for the charger which I guess I
should<00:02:23.440> anyone<00:02:23.800> use<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.600> sit<00:02:25.900> down<00:02:26.500> on

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
should anyone use so it can sit down on

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.360 
should anyone use so it can sit down on
a<00:02:26.890> flat<00:02:27.610> surface<00:02:28.230> uh<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.680> anyways<00:02:30.070> what<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.250> do

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.890 
a flat surface uh so anyways what you do
is<00:02:30.460> when<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.640> get<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.910> go<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.360> sign<00:02:31.600> up<00:02:31.780> to
