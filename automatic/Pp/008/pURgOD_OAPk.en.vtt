00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.700
 we are now with the gadget of the day 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.770
 again here at pearl tv and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.920
 this is really a great gadget today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.269
 so useful so useful and my dear 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.490
 colleague of cards is at Roland 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 several caressed also very enthusiastic 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.330
 stop by our draft or me 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.460
 honestly, consider the whole thing 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.470
 time which color to order me about it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 because that is something we in the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 by the way, for my wife last year, too 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.199
 a little bit the last nerve robbed 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.810
 we have in fact in the in the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 Entrance doors small gap to the corridor 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.110
 and honestly we could heat in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.579
 the last years like the world champion 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.260
 Nevertheless, if you have the feeling there 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.030
 pulls like pike soup and the cold air 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.739
 from the outside attracts Rhine and the warm 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
 Air looks like we have it out 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.070
 Try this typical spice experiment 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.629
 These bridges are dangling before you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.950
 But every time she is the door 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 of course that had to open again 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 correctly then place yours 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 do service 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.910
 this draft stops here 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 consist of two demo roles 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.770
 just pushed through under the door 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 That's exactly what works for all doors 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.879
 to six inches thick and above all 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.070
 things have the advantage that they have 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.630
 just here the position we hold something 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.549
 So you can not look very nice here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.290
 whether you open the door or you do 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 always have the insulation with you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.610
 and you will do that the next time 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 year with the additional costs 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.280
 So do not notice so much anymore 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 that means the warm air has to be heated 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.299
 remains consistently groove and the cold 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 air consequence of it and we have 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.840
 These great airflow stopper in the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 different colors for you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 we prepared them here in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.560
 seen in black 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 now is just white real estate and in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.250
 book you still have that fits 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.409
 Of course, very good to the wooden doors 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.909
 So look at what you have there 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.210
 need here they see again the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 summary of the different ones 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 order numbers for the black draft 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.820
 stopper is that the nc 57 04 for the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.049
 white the nc 57 05 and for beech the nc 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 57 06 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.610
 There you just look like your type 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.079
 Some doors create some glass doors 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 or black doors or hold these 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.369
 wooden doors are looking for the classic 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 right out and then you can do that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.810
 really perfect use and order 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.800
 Here we see this beautiful again 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.200
 different upholstery here 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.460
 the isolate course then perfect 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.890
 Absolutely they are beautiful 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.570
 flexible that means you can do it here 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.100
 really very flexible answer it the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.780
 slip especially over the smooth floors 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.820
 very good, but also over 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.980
 short flights carpet because the material 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.720
 the dress has a certain effect 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 doors do not have to be exactly six 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.810
 centimeters thick even if they are four 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.790
 centimeters thick is the insulation 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.860
 really given and great I think 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.320
 here the length also with 95 centimeters 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 this is a classic standard door 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.800
 size we have so here you can 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.960
 just does not have the problem that is 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.490
 runs like hechtsuppe even if their times 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.810
 Forgot to have the draft stop there 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.790
 somehow reasonable again at the door 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.950
 to place this draft stopper 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 makes every movement of the door with again 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.940
 please you were able to do it indoors 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.410
 the cold air stays outside and had to 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.870
 I never overemphasize here again 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 heating costs annoy heating costs you 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.960
 actually just fabricated around that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.880
 to heat staircase that has become here 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.190
 completely done for just six 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.060
 euro and 36 no matter what model one 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.580
 decides 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.020
 I think the color selection is great 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.280
 but also wants to rule all the way 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.900
 like to go a little more noble to works 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.730
 the great variation here with this one 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.410
 this art leather cover I think 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.750
 really nice and noble now 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.420
 We are really very noble made 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.950
 have with the artificial leather in two 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.780
 different colors for you 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.320
 prepared now you can see this here 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.989
 black 8 eur 46 each price for 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.850
 This great airflow stopper in black 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.950
 artificial leather that is of course again 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.300
 something very fine just when you stop it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.590
 as you say a bit more noble 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.450
 would have liked a bit more chic 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.190
 they are also subdivided so you can 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.630
 you also collapse because that's great 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.650
 works great if it works 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.870
 maybe take with you 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.520
 cottage in the arbor or so then 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.140
 you can work together well 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.370
 I think that's just great that's you 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.590
 So can sometimes a hotel room 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.030
 sealing from the door or sometimes 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.370
 other premises on one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.110
 Apartment if there had to heat 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.910
 in the cold air 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.650
 you can do it easily here 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.270
 with the luggage packed not much 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.310
 Platz weg does not cost the world and 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.720
 paper very much trouble and very much 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.340
 a lot of money the sport here again 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.710
 the summary of the order one 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.390
 former st draft excluder in 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.630
 imitation leather black dnc 57 07 and 2 569 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.430
 refers the 57 08 and 59 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.770
 So if you have it in the future 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.570
 means moving with us and through 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.460
 pike soup and maybe they have 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.600
 have missed either our broadcast 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.430
 maybe not really known 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.960
 that there is such a thing i knew it 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.120
 honestly until a few weeks ago 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.220
 Neither do I think it's awesome me 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.330
 she wants to know which color she wants 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.710
 Call us on 0 180 51 51 three times 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.710
 the two and have fun with it
