a lime and a bag of oranges okay let's

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.870 
a lime and a bag of oranges okay let's
see<00:02:36.690> next<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:38.050> are<00:02:38.260> your<00:02:38.470> digestive<00:02:39.190> suitors

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
see next up are your digestive suitors

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.670 
see next up are your digestive suitors
and<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.380> digestive<00:02:42.010> suitors<00:02:42.600> contains

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and the digestive suitors contains

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.990 
and the digestive suitors contains
phytonutrients<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> digestive<00:02:45.400> aid<00:02:45.610> that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
phytonutrients and digestive aid that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.330 
phytonutrients and digestive aid that
cut<00:02:46.240> down<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.690> gas<00:02:46.990> bloating<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.890> indigestion

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cut down on gas bloating and indigestion

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.199 
cut down on gas bloating and indigestion
so<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.300> got<00:02:49.920> sliced<00:02:50.920> beets<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.670> can<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
so I got sliced beets in a can and

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.180 
so I got sliced beets in a can and
artichoke<00:02:52.900> hearts<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.920> can<00:02:54.070> either

artichoke hearts and you can either

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.790 
artichoke hearts and you can either
saute<00:02:54.790> these<00:02:55.170> even<00:02:56.170> right<00:02:56.290> out<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
saute these even right out of the can

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.060 
saute these even right out of the can
otherwise<00:02:57.400> put<00:02:57.790> them<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> salad<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:59.110> if

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
only need one serving a day of these so

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.670 
only need one serving a day of these so

and radishes are in the fridge and
sulfur<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.820> actually<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.630> compound<00:03:23.260> that's<00:03:23.380> a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
sulfur is actually a compound that's a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.900 
sulfur is actually a compound that's a
building<00:03:24.250> block<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.880> liver<00:03:25.060> enzymes<00:03:25.510> and

building block of the liver enzymes and
that's<00:03:27.910> gonna<00:03:28.150> help<00:03:28.360> deactivate<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.530> 40%

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that's gonna help deactivate up to 40%

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.160 
that's gonna help deactivate up to 40%
of<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> toxins<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.600> actually<00:03:31.780> do<00:03:32.140> have

of the toxins and you actually do have

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.020 
of the toxins and you actually do have
to<00:03:32.560> have<00:03:32.769> one<00:03:33.220> egg<00:03:33.570> per<00:03:34.570> day<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.140> diet

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
to have one egg per day on this diet

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.540 
to have one egg per day on this diet
okay<00:03:37.030> nuts<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.750> have<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.140> have<00:03:38.350> two<00:03:38.950> servings

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
okay nuts you have to have two servings

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.770 
okay nuts you have to have two servings
of<00:03:39.760> lean<00:03:40.090> protein<00:03:40.290> every<00:03:41.290> day<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:43.030> addition<00:03:43.360> to

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
of lean protein every day in addition to

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.600 
of lean protein every day in addition to
the<00:03:43.870> egg<00:03:44.019> because<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.340> one<00:03:45.459> egg

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
the egg because you have to have one egg

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.170 
the egg because you have to have one egg
a<00:03:45.640> day<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.390> that's<00:03:46.630> gonna<00:03:46.840> be<00:03:46.930> lean<00:03:47.530> beef<00:03:47.860> I<00:03:48.280> got

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
a day so that's gonna be lean beef I got

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.320 
a day so that's gonna be lean beef I got
a<00:03:49.209> bag<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.510> salmon<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:51.190> have<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.700> bag<00:03:52.090> of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
a bag of salmon and I have a bag of

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.970 
a bag of salmon and I have a bag of
boneless<00:03:53.170> skinless<00:03:53.799> chicken<00:03:53.950> breast<00:03:54.640> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
boneless skinless chicken breast and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.590 
boneless skinless chicken breast and
protein<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.160> crucial<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.910> detox<00:03:58.239> process

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
protein is crucial to the detox process

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.780 
protein is crucial to the detox process
because<00:03:59.380> protein<00:03:59.860> boost<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.519> livers

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
because protein boost the livers

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.270 
because protein boost the livers
production<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:02.230> enzymes<00:04:02.769> that<00:04:03.040> actually

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
production of the enzymes that actually

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.270 
production of the enzymes that actually
convert<00:04:03.970> toxins<00:04:04.690> into<00:04:05.260> water<00:04:05.709> soluble

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
convert toxins into water soluble

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.190 
convert toxins into water soluble
substances<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.660> important<00:04:08.110> to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
substances so it's really important to

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.750 
substances so it's really important to
be<00:04:08.290> getting<00:04:08.530> your<00:04:08.620> protein<00:04:08.830> every<00:04:09.220> day<00:04:09.430> um

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
be getting your protein every day um

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.150 
be getting your protein every day um
your<00:04:10.299> lean<00:04:10.480> protein<00:04:10.989> stay<00:04:11.440> away<00:04:11.620> from<00:04:11.680> pork

about that later and that's what

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.300 
about that later and that's what
