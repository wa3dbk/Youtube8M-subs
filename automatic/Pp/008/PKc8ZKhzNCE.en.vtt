go<00:01:33.540> ahead<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.079> I'll<00:01:34.950> probably<00:01:35.220> loop<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
go ahead and I'll probably loop all the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.490 
go ahead and I'll probably loop all the
screenshots<00:01:36.150> twice<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.930> guys<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.320> can

that<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> whole<00:01:40.590> lot<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.950> new

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that good not a whole lot of new

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460 
that good not a whole lot of new
stuff<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.579> come<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.079> leak<00:01:43.439> but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
stuff has come out with this a leak but

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.410 
stuff has come out with this a leak but
of<00:01:43.860> course<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.460> actually<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.210> what

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
of course we actually get to see what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
of course we actually get to see what
the<00:01:45.509> game<00:01:45.689> looks<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:46.140> playing<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.979> DS<00:01:47.009> or

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the game looks like playing on the DS or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
the game looks like playing on the DS or
she<00:01:48.030> said<00:01:48.210> 3ds<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.100> really

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
she said 3ds and I think it's really

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
she said 3ds and I think it's really
interesting<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.939> tap<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> button<00:01:51.450> going

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
interesting you just tap a button going

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
interesting you just tap a button going
to<00:01:51.899> mega<00:01:52.079> evolution<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.070> also

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
to mega evolution I think it's also

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
to mega evolution I think it's also
really<00:01:53.820> interesting<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.200> very

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
really interesting that at the very

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.990 
really interesting that at the very
beginning<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> game<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.430> would<00:01:56.490> seem<00:01:56.790> like

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
beginning of the game it would seem like

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.910 
beginning of the game it would seem like
you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.299> based<00:01:57.509> off<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.530> read

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you know based off of what we just read

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.230 
you know based off of what we just read
it<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.189> seem<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> very<00:01:59.820> beginning<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
it would seem like the very beginning of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
it would seem like the very beginning of
the<00:02:00.329> game<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.320> Mewtwo<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.460> know
