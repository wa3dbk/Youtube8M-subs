00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.560 

then<00:00:16.380> I<00:00:16.500> use<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> weighted<00:00:17.070> nylon<00:00:17.790> hammer<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
then I use a weighted nylon hammer to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.450 
then I use a weighted nylon hammer to
flatten<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> pieces<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> steel<00:00:20.160> bench

block<00:00:21.020> these<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.200> good<00:00:22.440> solid<00:00:22.710> blows<00:00:23.130> because

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
block these are good solid blows because

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.429 
block these are good solid blows because
I'm<00:00:23.760> also<00:00:24.000> work<00:00:24.390> hardening<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> metal<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I'm also work hardening the metal to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.830 
I'm also work hardening the metal to
stiffen<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.920> up

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
stiffen it up

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
stiffen it up
I<00:00:27.900> clip<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:28.890> any<00:00:29.070> large<00:00:29.490> bits<00:00:29.850> with<00:00:30.300> flush<00:00:30.600> cut

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I clip off any large bits with flush cut

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
I clip off any large bits with flush cut
nippers<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.250> use<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> 220<00:00:33.150> grit

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
nippers and then I use a 220 grit

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.020 
nippers and then I use a 220 grit
wet/dry<00:00:34.110> sandpaper<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:35.430> sand<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> sides

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
wet/dry sandpaper to sand the sides

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.710 
wet/dry sandpaper to sand the sides
flush<00:00:37.460> where<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> cut<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> strip<00:00:39.330> there<00:00:39.570> are

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
flush where I cut the strip there are

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.660 
flush where I cut the strip there are
sharp<00:00:40.170> edges<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> smooth<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
sharp edges that I want to smooth and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
sharp edges that I want to smooth and
refine<00:00:42.150> I<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> snap-on<00:00:43.739> sanding<00:00:44.250> disc<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
refine I use a snap-on sanding disc in a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060 
refine I use a snap-on sanding disc in a
medium<00:00:45.210> grit<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.809> round<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> edges

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
medium grit to round off all the edges

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.210 
medium grit to round off all the edges
so<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.790> looks<00:00:47.970> like<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.330> made<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.720> way

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
so it looks like it was made this way

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.500 
so it looks like it was made this way
then<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.250> round<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> corners<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.330> each<00:00:51.600> piece

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.049 

next<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.440> make<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.620> dimple<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.250> then<00:00:58.520> drill<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.760> 1

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
next I make a dimple and then drill a 1

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.150 
next I make a dimple and then drill a 1
millimeter<00:00:59.329> hole<00:00:59.870> for<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.290> ear<00:01:00.440> wire<00:01:00.680> on<00:01:00.980> each

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.030 
millimeter hole for the ear wire on each
piece<00:01:01.630> then<00:01:02.630> I<00:01:02.720> flatten<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.440> work<00:01:03.680> hard<00:01:03.950> in

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
piece then I flatten and work hard in

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.450 
piece then I flatten and work hard in
the<00:01:04.129> metal<00:01:04.370> one<00:01:04.550> last<00:01:04.790> time<00:01:05.680> next<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.950> use<00:01:07.220> a
