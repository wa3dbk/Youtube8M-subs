process I did I got the rock I went
ahead<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> soaked<00:01:24.719> it<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.990> fresh<00:01:25.380> tap<00:01:25.740> water

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
ahead and soaked it in fresh tap water

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.249 
ahead and soaked it in fresh tap water
and<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:27.149> in<00:01:27.210> Maryland<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.719> chlorine

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and here in Maryland we have chlorine

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.069 
and here in Maryland we have chlorine
that<00:01:28.649> they<00:01:28.829> put<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.399> water<00:01:29.609> so

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
that they put into the water so

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.779 
that they put into the water so
essentially<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.109> also<00:01:31.740> added<00:01:32.070> bleach<00:01:32.490> into

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
essentially I also added bleach into

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.480 
essentially I also added bleach into

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that water let it sit for 24 hours so I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
that water let it sit for 24 hours so I
essentially<00:01:35.969> bleached<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> rock<00:01:36.869> 24<00:01:37.469> hours<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
essentially bleached the rock 24 hours I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
essentially bleached the rock 24 hours I
drain<00:01:38.039> that<00:01:38.189> water<00:01:38.460> away<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.149> added<00:01:40.079> new<00:01:40.289> fresh

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
drain that water away I added new fresh

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
drain that water away I added new fresh
water<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> head<00:01:41.820> chlorine<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.359> it<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
water the head chlorine in it from the
tap<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:44.280> used<00:01:44.609> some<00:01:44.939> neutralizer<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:46.320> cure

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.610 
saltwater and I you know to me that just
seems<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.510> waste<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.930> money<00:04:11.110> I'd<00:04:11.410> rather

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
a piece of live rock in that tank to

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.620 
a piece of live rock in that tank to
help<00:04:17.470> populate<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:18.280> water<00:04:18.580> so<00:04:19.270> I'm<00:04:19.420> sure

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
help populate the water so I'm sure

help populate the water so I'm sure
there's<00:04:19.840> some<00:04:19.989> bacteria<00:04:20.500> in<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.650> water<00:04:20.890> that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
there's some bacteria in the water that

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.150 
there's some bacteria in the water that
will<00:04:21.250> get<00:04:21.400> in<00:04:21.520> there<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.000> that<00:04:22.960> way<00:04:23.140> when<00:04:24.130> I

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
will get in there and that way when I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.310 
will get in there and that way when I
stick<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.670> alaric<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.510> my<00:04:25.660> aquarium<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.170> don't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
stick this alaric in my aquarium I don't

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.140 
stick this alaric in my aquarium I don't
have<00:04:26.530> any<00:04:26.680> kind<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:26.980> massive<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.580> nutrient

have any kind of massive a nutrient

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.090 
have any kind of massive a nutrient
spike<00:04:28.420> so<00:04:28.630> that's<00:04:28.780> my<00:04:28.960> ultimate<00:04:29.080> goal<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:30.040> I'm

spike so that's my ultimate goal so I'm

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.530 
spike so that's my ultimate goal so I'm
going<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.310> add<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.700> water<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.240> I'll<00:04:31.330> bring<00:04:31.480> it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
going to add the water and I'll bring it

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.790 
going to add the water and I'll bring it
back<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:33.720> okay<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.170> just<00:04:35.380> added<00:04:35.560> about

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
back to you okay so I just added about

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.300 
back to you okay so I just added about
12<00:04:36.160> gallons<00:04:36.610> of<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.360> saltwater<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:38.710> couple

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
12 gallons of the saltwater a couple

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.970 
12 gallons of the saltwater a couple
quick<00:04:39.460> notes<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:40.030> went<00:04:40.810> ahead<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.110> did<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
quick notes I went ahead and did the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.800 
quick notes I went ahead and did the
water<00:04:42.190> change<00:04:42.460> from<00:04:42.640> my<00:04:42.790> aquarium<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.510> figured

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
water change from my aquarium I figured

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.180 
water change from my aquarium I figured
that<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.260> would<00:04:44.380> be<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> best<00:04:44.860> most

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
that that would be the best most

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.010 
that that would be the best most
beneficial<00:04:45.820> for<00:04:45.940> my<00:04:46.060> cram<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.540> put<00:04:46.750> an

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
beneficial for my cram I put an

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.200 
beneficial for my cram I put an
additional<00:04:47.710> water<00:04:47.920> change<00:04:48.280> into<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.700> system

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
additional water change into the system

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.140 
additional water change into the system
and<00:04:49.420> then<00:04:50.290> this<00:04:51.010> water<00:04:51.340> here<00:04:51.670> is<00:04:51.760> going<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:51.970> get

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
and then this water here is going to get

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.930 
and then this water here is going to get
thrown<00:04:52.600> out<00:04:52.780> anyhow<00:04:53.290> so<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:53.950> hate<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.310> put<00:04:54.610> fresh

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
thrown out anyhow so I hate to put fresh

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.390 
thrown out anyhow so I hate to put fresh
salt<00:04:55.210> water<00:04:55.420> in<00:04:55.540> here<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.750> waste<00:04:56.050> it

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
salt water in here and waste it

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.770 
salt water in here and waste it
nevertheless<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:58.150> could<00:04:58.330> do<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.540> either<00:04:58.660> way

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
nevertheless you could do it either way

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.900 
nevertheless you could do it either way
it's<00:04:59.410> kind<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.830> up<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.280> just<00:05:00.370> assumed

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
it's kind of up to you I just assumed

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.480 
it's kind of up to you I just assumed
that<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.600> my<00:05:01.810> eyes<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:02.320> better<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.800> do<00:05:03.460> a

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
that in my eyes it's better to do a

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.310 
that in my eyes it's better to do a
water<00:05:03.730> change<00:05:03.850> when<00:05:04.330> your<00:05:04.480> existing<00:05:04.900> aquarium

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
water change when your existing aquarium

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.560 
water change when your existing aquarium
and<00:05:05.440> use<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.740> old<00:05:05.950> water<00:05:06.340> if<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.300> water<00:05:07.480> is

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
and use that old water if the water is

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.090 
and use that old water if the water is
real<00:05:07.720> dirty<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.110> just<00:05:08.290> let<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.440> settle<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.040> a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
real dirty you just let it settle for a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.070 
real dirty you just let it settle for a
while<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.640> all<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.180> dirtiness<00:05:10.540> will<00:05:10.870> settle

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
while and all the dirtiness will settle

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.330 
while and all the dirtiness will settle
to<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.260> bottom<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.770> then<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:11.890> can<00:05:11.950> siphon

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
to the bottom and then you can siphon

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.100 
to the bottom and then you can siphon
off<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.820> clean<00:05:13.090> water<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.570> use<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.930> for

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
off the clean water to use that for

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.420 
off the clean water to use that for
cycling<00:05:15.030> so<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.270> had<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.930> heater<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.040> bucket

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.539 
possible so I'm just trying to add some
additional<00:05:46.719> air<00:05:47.289> into<00:05:47.649> the<00:05:47.769> system<00:05:47.979> for<00:05:48.369> the

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:48.549 
additional air into the system for the

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:51.269 
additional air into the system for the
bacteria<00:05:49.199> my<00:05:50.199> understanding<00:05:50.739> is<00:05:50.860> as<00:05:51.069> the

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
bacteria my understanding is as the

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.519 
bacteria my understanding is as the
bacteria<00:05:51.459> reproduces<00:05:52.389> they<00:05:52.539> use<00:05:52.779> the<00:05:52.989> oxygen

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529 
bacteria reproduces they use the oxygen

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.989 
bacteria reproduces they use the oxygen
so<00:05:53.739> if<00:05:53.799> there's<00:05:54.009> not<00:05:54.069> enough<00:05:54.309> oxygen<00:05:54.789> in<00:05:54.909> the

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 
so if there's not enough oxygen in the

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:56.729 
so if there's not enough oxygen in the
system<00:05:55.179> I'm<00:05:55.599> afraid<00:05:56.169> it's<00:05:56.379> just<00:05:56.439> going<00:05:56.679> to

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:56.739 
system I'm afraid it's just going to

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:00.509 
system I'm afraid it's just going to
kill<00:05:56.949> that<00:05:56.979> bacteria<00:05:59.219> almost<00:06:00.219> forgot<00:06:00.489> I

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:00.519 
kill that bacteria almost forgot I

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.939 
kill that bacteria almost forgot I
forgot<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:01.059> plug<00:06:01.569> in<00:06:01.809> the<00:06:01.959> power<00:06:02.259> head<00:06:02.679> there

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
forgot to plug in the power head there

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.919 
forgot to plug in the power head there
let<00:06:03.429> me<00:06:03.459> just<00:06:03.519> take<00:06:03.819> you<00:06:03.849> a<00:06:03.969> closer<00:06:04.360> look<00:06:04.689> here

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:06.929 
let me just take you a closer look here

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.359 
let me just take you a closer look here
you<00:06:07.929> can<00:06:08.050> see<00:06:08.199> there's<00:06:08.409> the<00:06:08.589> power<00:06:08.769> head<00:06:09.039> right

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:09.369 
you can see there's the power head right

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.219 
you can see there's the power head right
here<00:06:09.849> and<00:06:10.059> then<00:06:10.179> it<00:06:10.300> just<00:06:10.419> has<00:06:10.569> a<00:06:10.599> tube<00:06:10.869> coming

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
here and then it just has a tube coming

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.269 
here and then it just has a tube coming
up<00:06:11.399> to<00:06:12.399> get<00:06:12.759> oxygen<00:06:13.360> in<00:06:13.539> and<00:06:13.919> it<00:06:14.919> just<00:06:15.099> makes

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279 
up to get oxygen in and it just makes

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.829 
up to get oxygen in and it just makes
you<00:06:15.610> know<00:06:15.729> these<00:06:15.849> nice<00:06:16.059> little<00:06:16.209> bubbles<00:06:16.689> so

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839 
you know these nice little bubbles so

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.829 
you know these nice little bubbles so
that's<00:06:16.989> just<00:06:17.169> how<00:06:17.289> much<00:06:17.469> make<00:06:17.800> the<00:06:17.919> water<00:06:18.839> so

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
that's just how much make the water so

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.999 
that's just how much make the water so
that<00:06:19.959> will<00:06:20.079> conclude<00:06:20.259> this<00:06:20.619> part<00:06:20.860> of<00:06:20.949> the

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
that will conclude this part of the

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.369 
that will conclude this part of the
video<00:06:21.159> what<00:06:21.999> I'll<00:06:22.089> do<00:06:22.269> is<00:06:22.479> and<00:06:22.749> about<00:06:23.049> a<00:06:23.079> week

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
video what I'll do is and about a week

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.799 
video what I'll do is and about a week
I'll<00:06:23.649> do<00:06:24.039> water<00:06:24.339> testing<00:06:24.879> and<00:06:25.059> then<00:06:25.269> update

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:25.809 
I'll do water testing and then update

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:28.709 
I'll do water testing and then update
videos<00:06:26.139> you<00:06:26.409> can<00:06:26.860> see<00:06:27.039> how<00:06:27.129> it<00:06:27.309> goes<00:06:27.489> and<00:06:27.849> then

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
videos you can see how it goes and then

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.229 
videos you can see how it goes and then
I'll<00:06:29.199> do<00:06:29.409> another<00:06:30.309> update<00:06:30.579> video<00:06:30.819> after<00:06:31.209> a

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:31.239 
I'll do another update video after a

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:33.089 
I'll do another update video after a
week<00:06:31.389> of<00:06:31.509> that<00:06:31.569> and<00:06:31.989> then<00:06:32.079> at<00:06:32.199> 30<00:06:32.499> days<00:06:32.709> and
