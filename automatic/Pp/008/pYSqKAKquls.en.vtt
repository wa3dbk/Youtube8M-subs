character<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.740> pretty<00:02:22.740> homophobic<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
character is pretty homophobic and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.290 
character is pretty homophobic and
misogynistic<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.910> I

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
misogynistic so know that going in I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.090 
misogynistic so know that going in I
know<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.260> sign<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> times

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
know that's kind of a sign of the times

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.660 
know that's kind of a sign of the times
I<00:02:29.430> mean<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> book<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.940> published<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.390> 1939

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
I mean the book was published in 1939

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.870 
I mean the book was published in 1939
but<00:02:33.770> it's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:35.340> little<00:02:35.490> bit<00:02:35.610> off-putting

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
but it's a little bit off-putting

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420 
but it's a little bit off-putting
especially<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> female<00:02:37.650> there's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
especially if you are a female there's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
especially if you are a female there's
the<00:02:38.820> moments<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.570> or<00:02:41.120> women<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.240> sucked

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the moments in here or women get sucked

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.670 
the moments in here or women get sucked
around<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.960> that's<00:02:43.110> okay

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
around and that's okay

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.370 
around and that's okay
in<00:02:44.520> fact<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.940> might<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:46.110> it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
in fact it might even really like it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.460 
in fact it might even really like it
yeah<00:02:46.800> um<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.270> we<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.630> put<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:48.960> aside

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
yeah um but if we just put that aside

included it on my list of top 100 novels

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.459 
included it on my list of top 100 novels
I'm<00:05:23.580> glad<00:05:23.819> I<00:05:23.849> read<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.360> I'm<00:05:24.629> not<00:05:24.810> sure<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.169> even

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
I'm glad I read it I'm not sure I even

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.890 
I'm glad I read it I'm not sure I even
ever<00:05:25.860> even<00:05:26.219> read<00:05:26.639> any<00:05:27.090> more<00:05:27.120> Raymond<00:05:27.569> Chandler

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
ever even read any more Raymond Chandler

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.409 
ever even read any more Raymond Chandler
but<00:05:28.139> I<00:05:28.169> think<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.650> if<00:05:29.520> this<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.270> something

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
but I think that if this is something

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.019 
but I think that if this is something
you're<00:05:30.750> into<00:05:31.110> if<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:32.580> want<00:05:32.669> to<00:05:32.819> kind<00:05:32.969> of

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
you're into if you want to kind of

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.809 
you're into if you want to kind of
explore<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.719> origins<00:05:33.840> origins<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:35.279> something

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
explore the origins origins of something

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.570 
explore the origins origins of something
like<00:05:35.940> this<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.270> think<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:37.169> it's<00:05:37.710> someone

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
like this and I think that it's someone

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.279 
like this and I think that it's someone
said<00:05:38.789> that<00:05:38.819> The<00:05:39.120> Big<00:05:39.300> Lebowski<00:05:39.449> is<00:05:39.900> actually

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
said that The Big Lebowski is actually

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.559 
said that The Big Lebowski is actually
loosely<00:05:40.650> based<00:05:40.770> off<00:05:41.099> this<00:05:41.370> plot<00:05:41.699> which<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:42.389> can

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
loosely based off this plot which I can

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.749 
loosely based off this plot which I can
