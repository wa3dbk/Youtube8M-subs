00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello my dear to the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.859
 first series by omas trickkiste 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.330
 Today there will be a prescription it was 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.460
 many of you are certainly interested 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 because I have it in my very first video 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.870
 have mentioned my skin routine and until 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
 almost half a year later 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.350
 Inquire many get as 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.449
 thing goes and if I can show first 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 these are the homemade ones 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.310
 Schiller Tine strips her 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 regions where blackheads occur more often 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.500
 Order speaks in the chin area on the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.930
 nose level or up here on the forehead 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.640
 because what I have with it unfortunately 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 multiply and and unfortunately often yes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 there are certain methods that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.090
 you can buy in the drugstore 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 so-called stripes they are unfortunately very 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.260
 expensive and knew that spend a lot of money 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 if I can show you how well 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 Doing it yourself saves money 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
 and hopefully many annoy 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.449
 because many stripes do not 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.219
 work if you are interested 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.899
 to know how to do that very easily 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 I want to do it myself 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 happy if you stay tuned and now in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 connection is then the recipe so 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 people for this recipe will be following 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 I need it completely 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.229
 I find myself ordinary milk 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900
 a container in which I use the milk 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 would once individually for mine indication 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 thought you need about 1 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.409
 teaspoon of defects further 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 you still need gelatin in powder form 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.380
 lisa gelatine tilts you two 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.270
 teaspoon also in a similar cup 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.869
 so that it is mixed with the milk afterwards 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 can be 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.930
 Finally, the said 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.000
 teaspoons so that you afterwards both 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 can mix with each other and voila 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 you do not need more ingredients here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.149
 So we have the two mentioned 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.590
 liquids or the two 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.240
 said ingredients 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.960
 what we are doing now is once the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.320
 milk in the two teaspoons of gelatin 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.320
 tilt 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.730
 and with the mentioned spoon once 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.850
 Stir in this mixture is now 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.149
 important that you put them in the microwave 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.750
 turns around because medium heat about 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.160
 Then heat every 39 seconds 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.040
 Microwave is different you should 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.170
 note that for me not about the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 It is allowed to boil it out 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 actually as with ordinary 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 milk to which one should pay attention speak at 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.970
 For some it will be five seconds 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 some but also 15 is important 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.150
 only that the end result so a cs 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.930
 Consistency gives you the first one 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.730
 Of course, you are not drained 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.910
 The hot blonde on the face 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 want to apply that mix our gelatin 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.310
 finished, you realize that it is so 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.290
 has a creamy sticky consistency and 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.850
 that the mass in any case lukewarm 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.959
 if you are not sure 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.790
 are in terms of temperatures 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.500
 just keep a finger in there and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.270
 Just try it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.980
 Please be very careful with it if the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.620
 latina is hot it is very very 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.910
 harmful to the skin therefore makes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.160
 that 's a nice temperature 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 before you have that on the affected 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.269
 make order so prevents the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.010
 any case that you burn yourself with it 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.600
 because we do not want that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.269
 and then it can be 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.489
 go after a wait of 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.140
 about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.930
 depending on how thick her layer 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.930
 applied the pad can be removed 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.530
 and you are best trying on the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.470
 outer edges begin to draw 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.130
 so that everything comes down immediately and theirs 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 glorious Rumpold to any small 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.799
 to remove residues 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.160
 ok so I'll take this one 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.170
 page and just start you see 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.190
 if you applied the layer thick 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.190
 it dissolves very fast 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.220
 so of course I have one more 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.950
 I'll leave a few then 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.770
 I have to do that and that's what I care about 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.320
 but right now you have one here 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:18.320
 even patch foil what you say so 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.970
 have deducted from your nose including 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.400
 can you already see that the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.590
 skin is very soft she has become 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:30.440
 open and that just the mask 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.970
 still has a certain amount of self-heat helps 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.770
 it is just the pores to open 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.830
 and the dirt really pore-deep too 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.100
 yes remove your life that was my tip 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.200
 for you my homemade blackheads 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.210
 mask and i hope of course it has 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.560
 you liked it and you could mess with it 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.700
 each case what to do or 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.770
 imitate it well 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.340
 always leave me in the comments 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.020
 new wishes for omas trickkiste and 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.510
 general questions or suggestions you 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.070
 while having videos here and me 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.540
 would say we see each other then as always 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.540
 I love everything at the next video
