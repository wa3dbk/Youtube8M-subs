00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.470
 hello I am marine and today I show 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.090
 you like a loop for one 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:17.500
 hair band hesitates fold the fabric of the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.500
 length after half 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.779
 Now let's take a closer look 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.779
 a gap in the middle of this seam 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.680
 it opened the loop a little bit like that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 that we have nato in the middle 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.480
 and take both ends 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.860
 now you can through the gap we 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.750
 let the loop go through 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.930
 then you lift the corners out with one 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 needle 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.780
 Now we want to go through the middle 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.910
 do a cruise and fold it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.900
 we know the substance over there 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.690
 where the middle is and pull on both sides 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.670
 Now we're in for a screech 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.100
 a very big stabs the front 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.900
 back and forth so he would not sewn 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.290
 can rise and leave behind 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.290
 open 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.390
 then you see the surfaces and that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.010
 only the opera is very important until it 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.930
 such a ruffled is that is quite whole 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:53.050
 tight then you can the thread there 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.910
 a little wrap around and I have 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.080
 now quite a nice taken on 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.640
 Of course you can also do the same 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.020
 Fabric next to the for the loop 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 the weather has just taken over 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 wound 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.250
 not fast on that one now 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.110
 Together and Switzerland is ready 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.830
 Now I only have to hold my hair 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.830
 stick to the wall 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.540
 thanks for watching a lot of fun and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 Until next time
