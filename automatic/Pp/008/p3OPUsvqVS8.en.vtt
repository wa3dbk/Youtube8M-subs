00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.570 

how<00:01:36.380> he<00:01:36.440> thought<00:01:36.710> when<00:01:36.980> we<00:01:37.010> were<00:01:37.100> setting<00:01:37.340> up

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
part of that we've sort of decided the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.719 
part of that we've sort of decided the
optimum<00:01:45.050> number<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.470> people<00:01:45.920> would<00:01:46.550> be<00:01:46.700> a

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
optimum number of people would be a

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.150 
optimum number of people would be a
hundred<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.540> still<00:01:47.810> keep<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.290> sense<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.860> team

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
hundred to still keep that sense of team

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.130 
hundred to still keep that sense of team
and<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.940> think<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.210> idea<00:01:50.300> behind<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.960> you

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
and I think the idea behind that is you

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.950 
and I think the idea behind that is you
fight<00:01:51.440> much<00:01:51.680> harder<00:01:52.100> if<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.910> know<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.570> person

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
fight much harder if you know the person

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.510 
fight much harder if you know the person
stood<00:01:54.260> next<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.620> you
