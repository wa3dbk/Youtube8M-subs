00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.440 

we<00:01:43.560> witness<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> new<00:01:44.159> bike<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:45.240> most

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
we witness a new bike that was the most

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.679 
we witness a new bike that was the most
important<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.590> us<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.880> was<00:01:48.149> quite<00:01:48.509> good

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
important for for us and was quite good

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
important for for us and was quite good
in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> beginning<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.310> there

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
in the beginning we start with there

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.459 
in the beginning we start with there
with<00:01:50.789> our<00:01:51.149> current<00:01:51.479> bike<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:53.719> was<00:01:54.719> not<00:01:55.289> so

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
with our current bike and was not so

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.679 
with our current bike and was not so
good<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.009> grip<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> attack<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
good because the grip of attack was a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.910 
good because the grip of attack was a
little<00:01:58.109> bit<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.609> too<00:01:59.880> slippery<00:02:00.299> for

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
little bit you know too slippery for

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.279 
little bit you know too slippery for
for-4<00:02:01.920> find<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> good<00:02:02.819> lap<00:02:03.000> time<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.020> limit

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
for-4 find a good lap time and the limit

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.940 
for-4 find a good lap time and the limit
of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> track<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.270> procedure<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.170> had

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
of the track and on that procedure I had

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.360 
of the track and on that procedure I had
a<00:02:07.979> small<00:02:08.310> class<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:10.229> anyway<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.129> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
a small class but anyway then we we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
a small class but anyway then we we
tried<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> proto<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.720> proto<00:02:12.930> bike<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
tried at the proto the proto bike and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
tried at the proto the proto bike and
and<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.370> was<00:02:14.549> happy<00:02:14.849> because<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.299> improve<00:02:15.629> in

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and I was happy because we improve in

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020 
and I was happy because we improve in
some<00:02:15.959> points<00:02:16.349> especially<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.640> mid<00:02:17.819> corner

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
some points especially in the mid corner

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.289 
some points especially in the mid corner
is<00:02:18.329> we're<00:02:18.650> struggling<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.129> year<00:02:20.299> and

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
is we're struggling more this year and

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.300 
is we're struggling more this year and
with<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.629> proto<00:02:21.840> bike<00:02:22.079> we<00:02:22.230> improve<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.709> but

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
with the proto bike we improve there but

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.490 
with the proto bike we improve there but
we<00:02:23.519> lose<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> north<00:02:24.420> side<00:02:24.690> we<00:02:24.870> lose<00:02:25.049> little

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
we lose in the north side we lose little

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.000 
we lose in the north side we lose little
bit<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> breakpoint<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> future

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
bit in the breakpoint so for the future

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
bit in the breakpoint so for the future
we<00:02:29.220> must<00:02:29.700> work<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> Terrier<00:02:31.110> we

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
we must work on that on the Terrier we

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.809 
we must work on that on the Terrier we
tried<00:02:31.500> some<00:02:31.709> mapping<00:02:31.920> things<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.700> bike

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
tried some mapping things on the bike

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.900 
tried some mapping things on the bike
and<00:02:33.359> also<00:02:34.109> we<00:02:34.290> had<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> chance<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.190> try<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.489> new

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
and also we had a chance to try the new

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.890 
and also we had a chance to try the new
bike<00:02:37.250> which<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.849> pretty<00:02:39.060> still<00:02:39.569> pretty

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
bike which it's pretty still pretty

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.809 
bike which it's pretty still pretty
young<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:40.109> we<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:40.950> did<00:02:41.129> some<00:02:41.340> laps<00:02:41.549> and

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
young so we just did some laps and

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.270 
young so we just did some laps and
basically<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.930> feeling<00:02:43.260> is<00:02:43.379> not<00:02:43.530> bad<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
basically the feeling is not bad but I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.160 
basically the feeling is not bad but I
think<00:02:44.579> we<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.329> things<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.630> improve<00:02:45.959> on

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
think we have some things to improve on

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.150 
think we have some things to improve on
on<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.590> new<00:02:46.739> bike<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.819> guess<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.709> next<00:02:49.889> time

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
on this new bike I guess the next time

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.400 
on this new bike I guess the next time
we<00:02:50.370> will<00:02:50.519> try<00:02:50.670> maybe<00:02:51.239> these<00:02:51.750> new<00:02:51.900> ideas<00:02:52.049> will

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
we will try maybe these new ideas will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.640 
we will try maybe these new ideas will
come<00:02:52.849> but<00:02:53.870> for<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> rest<00:02:55.139> I<00:02:55.319> think<00:02:55.349> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
come but for the rest I think the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.490 
come but for the rest I think the
overall<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.880> got<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.329> mapping<00:02:57.930> things<00:02:58.200> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
overall we got some mapping things and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.789 
overall we got some mapping things and
and<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.790> important<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.510> think<00:03:00.569> is<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.319> good

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and this is important I think is a good

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.849 
and this is important I think is a good
area<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.280> improve<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.019> we<00:03:04.019> had<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.500> good<00:03:04.680> way

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
area to improve and we had the good way

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.589 
area to improve and we had the good way
we<00:03:05.040> had<00:03:05.220> good<00:03:05.340> weather<00:03:05.400> today<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.269> could<00:03:06.450> do

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
we had good weather today so we could do

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.870 
we had good weather today so we could do
many<00:03:06.750> laps<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.349> track<00:03:07.680> condition<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.669> not

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
many laps and track condition was not

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.140 
many laps and track condition was not
really<00:03:09.180> really<00:03:09.780> special<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.829> at<00:03:11.190> least<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.609> we

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
really really special but at least we we

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.049 
really really special but at least we we
were<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:12.540> were<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.870> right
