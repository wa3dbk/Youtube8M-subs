00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 look bringing you a hinge that liquidates time mark for doors 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.819
 45 degree diagrano looks only at this hinge 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.529
 I'll start with the material 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.279
 it is made of steel 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.749
 on here 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.339
 in the lap lap has to assume that it was the clown who beat 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.989
 It's a detail that she has there. 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.550
 first when you make that adjustment 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.679
 three-dimensional of the height laterality depth 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.480
 once you make that adjustment 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 and you need to for example take the door off as you do 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.600
 if it is a hinge as you have employees set up was established in 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.999
 track that only realizes this 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.350
 You see that button you tighten. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.880
 take the door 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.219
 does the maintenance 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.519
 put it takes what you have to do and when it's time to put 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.070
 Look how you practiced. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.610
 I clicked 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.840
 there was the click 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.010

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.219
 with you left fifth placed 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.769
 without any difficulty 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.159
 here is another detail pays attention here at the door closing 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.140
 What happens? 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.440
 this fold said corporation has death without pain 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.630
 because that serves buffer it will make you do the closing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.520
 from your door 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.250

 another fan here 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.020
 finally 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.570
 inside the g1 a tube 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.780
 is not an external element close to the goal 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.659
 and looks only at 1 80 real 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.820
