you will get access to the extended and
modified<00:00:28.410> Maps<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:32.940> thing<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
modified Maps so the first thing that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.430 
modified Maps so the first thing that
you'll<00:00:33.540> notice<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.739> killed<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> have

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
you'll notice is I killed it that I have

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
you'll notice is I killed it that I have
kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> found<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.219> solution<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.180> missing

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
kind of found a solution to the missing

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.130 
kind of found a solution to the missing
meters<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:41.399> track<00:00:41.780> what<00:00:42.780> I've<00:00:42.899> done

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
meters on the four track what I've done

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.850 
meters on the four track what I've done
is<00:00:43.350> essentially<00:00:44.180> dropped<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.870> LED<00:00:46.590> lights

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
is essentially dropped the LED lights

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
is essentially dropped the LED lights
for<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.370> strip<00:00:47.640> search<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.390> cannot<00:00:48.719> see

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
for the strip search so you cannot see

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.360 
for the strip search so you cannot see
where<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> track<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> use

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
where you're on the track when you use

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
where you're on the track when you use
the<00:00:50.489> strip<00:00:50.730> search<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.149> instead<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.829> use

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the strip search but instead you can use

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
the strip search but instead you can use
these<00:00:53.219> beautiful<00:00:53.640> bodies<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.739> show<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
these beautiful bodies to show you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.150 
these beautiful bodies to show you
what's<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.390> actual<00:00:58.260> channel

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
what's going on on that actual channel

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.060 
what's going on on that actual channel
so<00:00:59.760> right<00:01:00.539> now<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> stop<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so right now you can see when I stop the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
so right now you can see when I stop the
music<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.650> actually<00:01:04.650> stops<00:01:05.570> lighting<00:01:06.570> up

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
music it actually stops lighting up

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.399 
music it actually stops lighting up
meaning<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.610> no<00:01:08.790> music

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
meaning that there there's no music

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.340 
meaning that there there's no music
plane<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> meant<00:01:11.040> Chen<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> good<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
plane I meant Chen so it's a good way to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
plane I meant Chen so it's a good way to
very<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.490> able<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> quickly<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.689> what's

the track that it was loaded up so it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.850 
the track that it was loaded up so it
would<00:02:32.480> take<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.960> little<00:02:33.080> while<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.650> would

would take it a little while it would

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
have a soft take over I don't have to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.910

turn<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> bottom<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.410> when<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.530> found<00:02:36.860> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
turn on the bottom and when I found that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.280 
turn on the bottom and when I found that
sweet<00:02:37.190> point<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.670> would<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.510> kind<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.990> began

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.160 
sweet point it would it kind of began
reacting<00:02:39.890> from<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:40.340> now<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.420> simply<00:02:41.960> just

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
reacting from there now I simply just

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.800 
reacting from there now I simply just
I'll<00:02:43.100> add<00:02:43.460> a<00:02:43.520> little<00:02:43.790> volume<00:02:44.030> what<00:02:44.390> taken<00:02:44.690> to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
I'll add a little volume what taken to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.360 
I'll add a little volume what taken to
take<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.320> little<00:02:45.530> volume<00:02:45.860> off

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
take a little volume off

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.040 
take a little volume off
I<00:02:46.400> don't<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.300> have<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.570> think<00:02:47.840> about

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
I don't do they have to think about

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.410 
I don't do they have to think about
finding<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.650> sweet<00:02:48.800> point<00:02:49.220> first<00:02:49.520> or<00:02:50.300> that

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
finding that sweet point first or that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.040 
finding that sweet point first or that
sweet<00:02:50.600> spot<00:02:51.020> if<00:02:51.410> you<00:02:51.680> want<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.540> go<00:02:53.540> back<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
sweet spot if you want to go back to the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.390 
sweet spot if you want to go back to the
original<00:02:54.200> setting<00:02:54.740> just<00:02:54.860> hold<00:02:55.130> down<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
original setting just hold down the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.430 
original setting just hold down the
shift<00:02:55.640> button<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.240> then<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.200> are

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
shift button and then you are

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.800 
shift button and then you are
essentially<00:02:58.250> going<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.420> where<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.690> takes

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
essentially going back to where it takes

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.530 
essentially going back to where it takes

engage 3 &amp; 4 s if you hold down shift
and<00:05:46.289> I<00:05:46.349> can<00:05:46.590> activate<00:05:47.099> them<00:05:47.750> right<00:05:48.750> now

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
and I can activate them right now

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.200 
and I can activate them right now
they're<00:05:49.139> not<00:05:49.250> actually<00:05:50.250> telling<00:05:50.520> me<00:05:50.699> giving

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
they're not actually telling me giving

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.839 
they're not actually telling me giving
me<00:05:51.270> feedback<00:05:51.539> via<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.680> LEDs<00:05:53.099> to<00:05:53.490> show<00:05:53.669> me

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
me feedback via the LEDs to show me

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.360 
me feedback via the LEDs to show me
whether<00:05:54.779> they're<00:05:55.110> on<00:05:55.319> maybe<00:05:55.830> something<00:05:56.159> I

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
whether they're on maybe something I

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.309 
whether they're on maybe something I
would<00:05:56.490> work<00:05:56.639> on<00:05:56.789> down<00:05:57.690> the<00:05:57.870> line

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
would work on down the line

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:04.189 
would work on down the line
so<00:06:00.169> filters<00:06:01.169> on<00:06:01.380> pull<00:06:02.279> this<00:06:02.430> off<00:06:03.050> holding<00:06:04.050> down

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
so filters on pull this off holding down

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:15.140 
so filters on pull this off holding down
the<00:06:04.349> shift

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.210
