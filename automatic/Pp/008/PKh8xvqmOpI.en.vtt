00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.309
 hello today I'm going to teach you to make this card in Merida 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.970
 sergio no 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.970
 what do you need 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.550
 you need 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.499
 the base card 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.369
 in this case white color 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.470
 of 10 by 7 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 you need 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.040
 a paper 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.980
 of six three quarters 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 by four three quarters 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 4 pieces of paper 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.920
 another day next 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.260
 cut 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.140
 3par 3 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.110
 two and a half by two and a half 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.040
 two for all 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.590
 a if I for junin 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 this 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.770
 let's express 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.240
 working 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.650
 the tree 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 and I'm going to do with the first paper 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 is to fold it in half 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.810
 to speak it well 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 in a triangle 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 twister 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.090
 and then take over 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 to the sides and I have 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.000
 this triangle hills to return to the obvious 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 towards the middle in this way 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.220
 remove will remain 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
 it's sad 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.890
 I will accept what has been 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 in mind 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.389
 these three leaders 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.729
 I was going to argue that this design 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.859
 make sure the paper is soft so you can do the double 5 difficulty 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.349
 something 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.939
 so he came to us 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.169
 sizes 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.169
 and we are going to have 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.519
 the tree in this way 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.559
 let's work the card 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 let's go adams 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.869
 make sure that 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.059
 aspirations girdle tengas 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.499
 another niche 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.469
 8 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 like that of our children 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.589
 this case and use of the red color you can use the color green the color brown 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.719
 after your preference 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.719
 you can use another design 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.689
 press tv no 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.589
 let's proceed to ride this sheet on the card 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.949
 agora 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.529
 let's join 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.559
 our christmas policy 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.569
 I suggest you start with the part 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.569
 higher 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:58.639
 in trees for one hundred 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.639
 and the folded papers 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.449
 you have to try to put it this way 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 he puts it in and out 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.549
 and this one too 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.549
 francis you have a little tree 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.559
 ten more or less where you want 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.309
 a point 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 we drive 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.909
 remember 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.749
 and the other part of the tree is incorporated here therefore 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 I suggest you do not appeal 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.289
 I suggest you only appeal 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.289
 the top 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.129
 from pp 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.129
 this is so that you do not have 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 in the other 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.819
 when 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 in this context 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.249
 so it should stay still 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.509
 by kelly 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.509
 I'm going to put him 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.039
 to see him live 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.180
 account 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:12.939
 it was time 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.939
 bwin are for emergencies 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.400
 putin 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 the 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.020
 if it is 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.020
 to give 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.020
 manresa before the limited 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.869
 I'm going to put him 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:43.180
 what do you want? 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.539
 super easy to do
