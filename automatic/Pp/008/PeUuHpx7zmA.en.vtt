itself<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.090> dramatic<00:00:57.539> architecture<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
itself to dramatic architecture that can

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.430 
itself to dramatic architecture that can
accentuate<00:00:59.340> its<00:00:59.609> natural<00:01:00.180> setting<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:01.260> also
