00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and think that it tells you a dwelling because 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.000
 Someone had grabbed your hand or 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.520
 think that 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.210
 when I was told that the heart 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.210
 end of the world 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.560
 it's father to come back and it's really been the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.910
 adventure our life have the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.310
 opportunity to travel with our music 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.980
 to live from our stories then 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.670
 whether to sing again or to love you to sing 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.670
 wherever you are 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.470
 changing then we also go the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.570
 man is changing while we go 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.070
 thinking about the song the man is going to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.070
 change the story 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.610
 hear and your meals and apart 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.970
 obviously passion is such music for 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.970
 your 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.520
 I imagine that they also remind me of a 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.520
 little time of the libretto 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.370
 and although we would like to have many cars 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.300
 when we have free time we sleep 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.370
 a lot but without so much luck installed 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.990
 we can do better tennis read me 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.990
 love to read watch TV 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.869
 and cooking also one day I love 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.350
 cervico with his favorite food the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.350
 desserts 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.380
 I think I love Japanese but 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.380
 lately 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.079
 I'm like Mexican food, nothing 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.810
 totally agree and we have a great 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:49.399
 variety of food that hello no 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.689
 we would end up hear we go with the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.750
 questions from the public already to finish 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.220
 says Giovanni Edward what does it mean for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.830
 you celebrate 10 years in the auditorium 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.900
 means the world to us when 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.000
 we signed with sony 10 years ago we were 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.010
 eating in the restaurant in front of the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 auditorium and I remember perfect 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.060
 that day I turned to see him I said imagine 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 One day you can be in the auditorium 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.390
 and we are treading then is it means 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.970
 many achievements a lot of work a lot 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.910
 discipline a lot of delivery not and that about 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.700
 to celebrate effectively because then very 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.130
 well you already know in the national auditorium 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.320
 says with what artist band would you like 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.360
 I hope they come to visit us nobody 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.460
 good with a band that we grew up 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.590
 listening to his music and it was for us 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.440
 an honor to be part of this project 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.760
 it was with the men that we have a 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.820
 later in madrid and they talked to us 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.250
 invite us to be part of this of his 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.380
 disc of 25 years of career and ashley or 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.450
 with the first tour we sang marta 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.610
 have a pacemaker then it 's a group 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.550
 that we have loved for years 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 and be able to be the only Mexicans 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.570
 invited to this project was an honor and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.520
 I noticed we were named after 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.290
 mexico high and we are an end of 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.110
 week with them we share 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.210
 also the last week with others 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.970
 fellow artists and we recorded 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.620
 trembling in a song that we love 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.600
 and we sang it with life then it was 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.520
 an incredible experience and at the same 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.520
 time I think when I had it 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:34.390
 once on stage also to the 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.550
 musicians who are here accompanying the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.860
 of course while congratulations 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.080
 boys and already the last question of 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.090
 the night there is already mini from venezuela we 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.560
 question ask the girls because 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.040
 they always look at each other when they finish 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.040
 sing a song 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:57.520
 because we look we will see no 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.110
 I think it 's like this is that in the end 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.910
 we are fulfilling a dream 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.710
 count but then I think it's a 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.270
 thing to look at and have a second 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.460
 complicity not to see what we are 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.840
 getting together and share it with him that 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.040
 let me once said that every time 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.850
 have a song look at me to say 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.850
 how wow 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.180
 the truth the cloths to the sun 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.400
 what I think but sometimes it costs me 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.639
 work sing when I grow this 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.639
 beauty 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.980
 the humor that remains does not mention that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.350
 they are together all the time 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.700
 practically and on tour and everything and 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.710
 obviously they have a great time in the 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.200
 scenario but it's a job there's no 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.540
 be so long you know I admire a lot 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.000
 the soloists because it's work though 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.010
 It seems to be a very social work because 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.990
 you are always surrounded by many people to 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.360
 I think it's from the races of more 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.640
 loneliness because everyday you are a country 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.770
 different do not be different you're far 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.460
 of your family away from your home away from 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.800
 your everyday and in the end the people who 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.390
 travel at the end it goes as isolating from the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.220
 world and I appreciate that I have my 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.290
 sister because it is is to reaffirm is 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.560
 someone who does not move in my life 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.970
 today and the truth leaving all the weapons 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.440
 aside, it's amazing to be with that and 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.410
 because all the time he 's doing with 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.090
 the good jokes and having fun not and 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.170
 inappropriate sometimes but it does not tell me anymore 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.170
 that I am supplications 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.390
 then truth I do not know what is to promise 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.390
 do not 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.789
 this says he wanted to do with his house is 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:47.729
 a song that is public 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.729
 and everyone shares the jokes no no no 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.230
 bush we have no accompaniment 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.720
 they did not have for the metals not but 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.630

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.330
