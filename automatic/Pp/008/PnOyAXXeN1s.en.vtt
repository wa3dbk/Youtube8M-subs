00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that said I would rate this a solid 4

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.660 
that said I would rate this a solid 4
out<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.759> 10<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.799> main<00:01:53.040> use<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
since I can't do it then it's no point

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.789 
since I can't do it then it's no point
