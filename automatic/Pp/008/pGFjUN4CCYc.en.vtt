hi<00:00:01.140> it's<00:00:01.589> just<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.949> quick<00:00:02.159> demo<00:00:02.580> with<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.240> cigar

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi it's just a quick demo with my cigar

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi it's just a quick demo with my cigar
box<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.470> first<00:00:04.500> one<00:00:04.950> I've<00:00:05.069> ever<00:00:05.190> built

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
box and the first one I've ever built

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730 
box and the first one I've ever built
probably<00:00:06.299> looks<00:00:06.629> less<00:00:06.810> interesting<00:00:07.410> now<00:00:07.560> than

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
probably looks less interesting now than

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.320 
probably looks less interesting now than
when<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.919> was<00:00:08.010> half<00:00:08.189> built<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.910> speaker

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
when it was half built and speaker

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390 
when it was half built and speaker
that's<00:00:09.450> full<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.660> water<00:00:09.900> but<00:00:10.290> thought<00:00:11.070> I'd<00:00:11.219> let

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
that's full of water but thought I'd let

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.339 
that's full of water but thought I'd let
you<00:00:11.429> know<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> sounds<00:00:12.240> like<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.630> if<00:00:13.290> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you know what it sounds like so if I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.110 
you know what it sounds like so if I
switch<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.130> should<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.730> any<00:00:14.940> lack

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
switch it on you should with any lack

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.140 
switch it on you should with any lack

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
you could see that one again yeah it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.370 
you could see that one again yeah it
works<00:00:22.730> if<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.910> play<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.390> turned<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.439> down

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.390 

that's<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.370> half<00:00:29.940> way<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:31.070> right<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.220> can

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
that's about half way up right you can

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.970 
that's about half way up right you can
have<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:33.090> difference

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:54.060 

turn<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> right<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.780> there's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:40.199> bit

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.910 

well<00:00:54.880> I<00:00:54.910> like<00:00:55.180> those<00:00:55.450> putting<00:00:56.440> some<00:00:56.590> effects

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
well I like those putting some effects

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.910 
well I like those putting some effects
pedals<00:00:57.340> through<00:00:57.520> it<00:00:57.610> go<00:00:58.500> reverb<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:02.320> here<00:01:02.650> if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
pedals through it go reverb one here if

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.970 
pedals through it go reverb one here if
I<00:01:03.040> turn<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.870> volume<00:01:04.870> but<00:01:05.050> half<00:01:05.260> way<00:01:05.290> up<00:01:05.680> put

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
I turn it volume but half way up put

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.660 
I turn it volume but half way up put
that<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:08.560> trying<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.830> get<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.010> clean<00:01:09.340> sound

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
that on just trying to get a clean sound

00:01:09.670 --> 00:02:04.240 
that on just trying to get a clean sound
with<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.120> bit<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.450> reverb

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.440 

you<00:02:05.250> turn<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> off<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:08.300> turn<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you turn that off and turn the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
you turn that off and turn the
distortion<00:02:09.929> pedal<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.349> I'm<00:02:11.250> surprised<00:02:11.670> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
distortion pedal on I'm surprised that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:03:12.370 
distortion pedal on I'm surprised that
allowed<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.120> goes

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.410 

so<00:03:13.360> now<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:16.160> problem<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.610> I've<00:03:16.880> got<00:03:17.030> speaker

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
so now the problem is I've got speaker

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.710
