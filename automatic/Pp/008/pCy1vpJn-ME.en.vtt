00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
with ultra runners but we also brought a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.120 
with ultra runners but we also brought a
3d<00:01:07.909> foot<00:01:08.179> scanner<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:08.990> looped<00:01:09.409> ultra<00:01:09.920> race

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
3d foot scanner to a looped ultra race

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.190 
3d foot scanner to a looped ultra race
and<00:01:10.460> in<00:01:10.999> advance<00:01:11.359> we<00:01:11.600> worked<00:01:11.899> with<00:01:12.049> some

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
and in advance we worked with some

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.529 
and in advance we worked with some
runners<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.130> identified<00:01:13.670> people<00:01:14.030> who<00:01:14.240> would

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
runners and identified people who would

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.410 
runners and identified people who would
stop<00:01:15.079> as<00:01:15.859> they<00:01:16.490> made<00:01:16.700> their<00:01:16.729> way<00:01:16.880> around<00:01:17.119> each

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
stop as they made their way around each

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.389 
stop as they made their way around each
loop<00:01:17.719> to<00:01:18.079> have<00:01:18.200> their<00:01:18.409> foot<00:01:18.619> scan<00:01:18.920> during<00:01:19.280> the

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
loop to have their foot scan during the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.889 
loop to have their foot scan during the
race<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:19.789> we<00:01:19.909> could<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.240> what's<00:01:20.450> happening

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
race so we could see what's happening

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.749 
race so we could see what's happening
actually<00:01:21.109> inside<00:01:21.679> the<00:01:21.740> shoe<00:01:22.159> as<00:01:22.429> they're

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
actually inside the shoe as they're

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.969 
actually inside the shoe as they're
running<00:01:23.060> these<00:01:23.179> distances<00:01:23.659> we<00:01:24.590> use<00:01:24.770> that

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
running these distances we use that

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.980 
running these distances we use that
information<00:01:25.039> to<00:01:25.670> develop<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:26.149> new<00:01:26.359> last<00:01:26.659> that's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
information to develop a new last that's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.499 
information to develop a new last that's
specific<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:27.889> shoe<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:28.789> accommodates

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
specific to this shoe that accommodates

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.690 
specific to this shoe that accommodates
the<00:01:30.289> foot<00:01:30.469> swelling<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.920> an<00:01:31.100> ultra<00:01:31.429> runners

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
the foot swelling that an ultra runners

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.039 
the foot swelling that an ultra runners
going<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.939> experience<00:01:32.450> over<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.689> course<00:01:32.929> of

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
going to experience over the course of

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.929 
going to experience over the course of
the<00:01:33.139> long<00:01:33.319> run<00:01:33.529> what<00:01:34.279> are<00:01:34.399> some<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.759> key

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
the long run what are some of the key

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.690 
the long run what are some of the key
features<00:01:35.149> on<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.689> 1210<00:01:36.139> so<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.279> addition<00:01:37.520> to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
features on the 1210 so in addition to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.669 
features on the 1210 so in addition to
that<00:01:37.939> new<00:01:38.149> last<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.869> actually<00:01:38.899> worked<00:01:39.439> with

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
that new last we actually worked with

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.580 
that new last we actually worked with
vibram<00:01:40.219> on<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.670> soul<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.270> in<00:01:42.139> this<00:01:42.289> case<00:01:42.529> we

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
vibram on the soul and in this case we

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.429 
vibram on the soul and in this case we
wanted<00:01:43.130> again<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.729> avoid<00:01:43.990> delamination<00:01:44.990> we

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
wanted again to avoid delamination we

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.830 
wanted again to avoid delamination we
wanted<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.799> create<00:01:45.889> one<00:01:46.549> continuous<00:01:46.840> very

is<00:01:51.590> Rev<00:01:52.219> light<00:01:52.459> which<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.729> something<00:01:53.179> that<00:01:53.270> we

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
is Rev light which is something that we

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.239 
is Rev light which is something that we
use<00:01:53.509> on<00:01:53.689> a<00:01:53.719> lot<00:01:53.959> of<00:01:54.049> our<00:01:54.139> performance<00:01:54.709> products
