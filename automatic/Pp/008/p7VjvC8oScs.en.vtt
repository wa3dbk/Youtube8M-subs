you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> tell<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:31.530> things

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you can just kind of tell some things

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.370 
you can just kind of tell some things
that<00:01:32.040> aren't<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.600> maybe<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> best<00:01:34.049> quality

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that aren't like maybe the best quality

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.520 
that aren't like maybe the best quality
just<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:37.020> bit<00:01:37.140> messy

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
just kind of like a little bit messy

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.469 
just kind of like a little bit messy
looking<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.970> think<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> I'll

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
looking but I don't think that I'll

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.539 
looking but I don't think that I'll
change<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.079> how<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.009> board<00:01:41.250> rides

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
change it all how the board rides

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
change it all how the board rides
there's<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.750> some<00:01:43.740> paint

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
there's just kind of like some paint

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.469 
there's just kind of like some paint
splotches<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.950> cool-looking<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.850> think

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
splotches but it's cool-looking I think

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
splotches but it's cool-looking I think
it'll<00:01:48.600> ride<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:51.149> light

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
it'll ride pretty well it's really light

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
it'll ride pretty well it's really light
and<00:01:54.170> once<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.130> gripped<00:01:56.700> in

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and once I get it all gripped in

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.429 
and once I get it all gripped in
everything<00:01:57.500> then<00:01:58.500> I'll<00:01:58.649> make<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> video<00:01:59.159> and

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
everything then I'll make a video and

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
everything then I'll make a video and
tell<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> rides<00:02:02.630> give<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> full

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
tell you how it rides give you a full

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.410 
tell you how it rides give you a full
conclusion<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.890> probably<00:02:05.670> won't<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
conclusion of it probably won't be for a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.180 
conclusion of it probably won't be for a
week<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.229> two<00:02:07.610> but<00:02:08.610> uh<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.709> say<00:02:10.979> it's
