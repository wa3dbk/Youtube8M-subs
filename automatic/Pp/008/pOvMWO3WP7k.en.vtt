00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello today we will show you how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 we make tomatoes painted over 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.830
 we do it for the winter we are in the cellar right away 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.839
 I'll show you 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.130
 special ones below the rack pan 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.740
 and tell there for this we need the most 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 tomatoes we will do pickle 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.099
 for brine need to take water or 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.199
 key good from a well or water 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.840
 as we have from the filter where there is 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.630
 germicidal lamp and kills bacteria 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.450
 or if you have no means of such water 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 you will need to boil water and and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.940
 cool to room temperature we 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.719
 take here a little bit 10 liters of water 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 bucket alone 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.989
 10 liters take 500 grams of salt can 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.320
 five hundred six hundred 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 good rock salt coarse grained 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 without neodated non marine 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.770
 ordinary salt further we needed 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770
 garlic 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:13.229
 leaves cherry leaves and horseradish leaves and myself 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.540
 horseradish root also black leaves 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.030
 currants 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.520
 I take parsley 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 yes even it will be necessary on the road to snatch 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 dill and pepper peppers plain Well 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.490
 how would such a brine be more so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.479
 taste i love the taste of pepper and bitter pepper 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:44.610
 and so we do what we do to start 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.540
 Of course, cut the garlic a little bit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.600
 cut the greens well and put it all in 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 capacity which will be salted these 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.219
 tomatoes tomatoes somewhere will process 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.219
 this salting will take 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.439
 about a half to even two 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.439
 months because she immediately put it 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.049
 the cold if left on the warm 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.370
 they are now very elevated temperature 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:17.069
 can quickly shudder such as 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:21.629
 would be so tasty pour salt and need 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.720
 mix well and leave somewhere on 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.840
 some time maybe even an hour 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:35.670
 call for it to be so settled because 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:38.120
 that there may be some connection docs 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.379
 some ears we have it all well 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.840
 mix and leave the water cold 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:51.050
 i.e. this is such a cold way 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 salting tomatoes without vinegar without sugar 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.870
 but what about tannic spices ? 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.110
 plants that will give 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.769
 it is this tomato flavor of course 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.260
 preferably tomatoes so they were all 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.769
 how would you in this tight little so soft 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.140
 everything is desirable the same size well you 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.090
 see that this is a tomato of our kind 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.690
 equipped with a glass of opportunity not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.330
 so that they are not all the same 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.080
 strength is given not for two to two 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:33.200
 months they seemed to quarrel all 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.200
 the taste you understood that we are in our 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.269
 because 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:58.480
 live so spilling out 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:04:03.340
 put tomatoes on top of a puddle 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.340
 remaining green icon 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:24.680
 two pepper peppers 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:35.350
 Leaflets take off in order to immediately how 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:39.040
 would let all these flavors and pour 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.040
 and length 1 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.070
 he must cover mated on top here 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:09.810
 see how much sediment can still be in 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:05:11.760
 this salt and dill so we have a pan 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.290
 stainless steel 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.720
 this is a medical stainless steel 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.070
 stainless steel made a circle you can do 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.460
 better of course if there is no such wooden 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.660
 wooden coil wooden circle belly 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.710
 so and 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.200
 it should be covered with brine 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.960
 if one must still can put some 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.410
 there is a jar that's all we have left 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.590
 house and a half about two months later we 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.930
 tomatoes are laid on the banks 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.050
 two-liter one liter men 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:56.410
 spread out and therefore very convenient to take 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.780
 myself in the winter in the refrigerator here and pans 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.850
 completely free of course this time 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.590
 while they will have to play 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.940
 wash this napkin several times 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.490
 wash maybe a little bit there by 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.830
 sides of the pan to the tomatoes 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.310
 that smell was not felt and 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.340
 the taste of this fermented unnecessary a 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:21.910
 so will the good pickle be good 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.310
 good must be tomatoes here and 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.590
 comfortable so that they will 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.430
 laid out by the banks that is this 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.530
 them a temporary place until they are 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.360
 to roam 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.130
 maybe show it to him later 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.210
 but now if you want to use 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.750
 this method i put this video we put 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.479
 this video is for you to see what 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:49.590
 how they will be here we have this we wrote for 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.870
 we do it and the year is so convenient for us 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.350
 so do we when 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.350
 your appetite
