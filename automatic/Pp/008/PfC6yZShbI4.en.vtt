reads i think i did i'm going to go

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.570 
reads i think i did i'm going to go
explore<00:05:04.340> for<00:05:04.639> a<00:05:04.669> reads<00:05:07.030> after<00:05:08.030> i<00:05:08.389> sleep<00:05:09.580> so

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580

from my wheat farm because I'd have to
rebuild<00:06:43.640> it<00:06:43.880> and<00:06:46.720> guess<00:06:47.720> there's<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.200> desert<00:06:48.740> I

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010
