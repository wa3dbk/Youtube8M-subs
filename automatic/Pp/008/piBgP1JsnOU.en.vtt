00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.380
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 next wish duel 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 The duel left us alex leavitt 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.420
 youtube posted i really liked the idea 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.400
 very well 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.779
 yes and I have already before 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:34.079
 written down before the dice 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.690
 he wishes the tracks versus johnny 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.920
 bomber blast because it take from the element 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.129
 Of course we do all ours 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.420
 habitual setting for food power 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 ups from the pounding live 5 vers 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 coffee consumption are a little annoying yes 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 all level 20 so and the senator 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 did you lose no but I wanted 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 my random generator get out 3 this 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:10.950
 is frosty from Boston 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 here i wanted to take the tracks and im 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.340
 Winter luckily there is no snow left 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.570
 Ask my questions first frozen 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.009
 See on the other side is one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.509
 apple tree or apple in winter 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.680
 We almost go away to the apple tree 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.680
 how would you go 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.259
 what does think about it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.829
 Maybe one of the names will happen to you 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.350
 bad 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.180
 the shortest way to the apple tree though 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 between you is a frozen lake 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.939
 and diacon , of course, is apple 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.939
 food hanged 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 I think you predicted that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 I lose this duel stupid question 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.310
 an apple tree in winter these are ideal 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.069
 so very special kind 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.509
 It is plastic overgrown biologically 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.099
 not at all possible and you can force 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.910
 no plastic know behind it in the 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.830
 closeness is clear 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.060
 yes that was already clear for many 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.049
 that duel lose because 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 damn this one the bomb 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.700
 it just bursts that always powered 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.769
 not only johnny is general 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.269
 lamp that yes most of all I'm still 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:41.750
 everything played as normal 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:45.989
 First, not always quite bad 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.239
 I must also dismantle a slow 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.849
 a fast tree after seeing the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.230
 last fights or last fight 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:10.769
 has decisively lost to the one 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:15.090
 was my life dream I have you 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.040
 do not demand deducted there as well 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.950
 if his also had milk price at 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.100
 less has not fought in the rain 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.100
 movie theater 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:32.660
 I know the wish to fight must be bad 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:37.370
 that you can not take off 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.379
 I pull off the bomb I like 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.400
 never think of anything as octopus actually 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:47.299
 nice and pvp is playable but in pvp 1 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.739
 I just do not like it there 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.480
 Let's take it and do quarter of four 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.190
 you can also run one-third of them 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.209
 because the games are coming out 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.799
 rider on the cr 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.090
 especially if you are not with honey 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.690
 Maybe then they will meet him 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.970
 every case 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.760
 I know that was a clear victory for 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.690
 Bammer blows the baking cookies like that 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.959
 honestly I have too 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.819
 anticipated and typhoid invaded 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.310
 wish you no duels with blas 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.310
 winner of the andi is always easy 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:34.370
 again we have had a baske 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.020
 I had the first championship with me 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.789
 He also has a big following with Hendrik 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:43.000
 Hot tub although he lost the pictures 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:46.370
 pictures so high estimates the wm too 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.590
 I hope it has you and also dialect 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.450
 like you share is on facebook to 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.979
 Give us a thumbs up 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.599
 Thumb down probably fallen 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.610
 but has justified it better 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.570
 can do and I've always 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.570
 one to see you next time
