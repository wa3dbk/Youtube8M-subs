00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
previously installed the antenna on the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.270 
previously installed the antenna on the
roof<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> ran<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> wire<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.830> length<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.129> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280

roof and ran the wire the length of the
car<00:02:24.489> all<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.760> way<00:02:24.879> back<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:25.540> under<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
car all the way back so it's under the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.900 
car all the way back so it's under the
apost<00:02:26.140> under<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> carpeting<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.310> looks<00:02:27.489> much

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
apost under the carpeting it looks much

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.759 
apost under the carpeting it looks much
nicer<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.480> way<00:02:28.540> these<00:02:29.260> are<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> plug

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
nicer that way these are going to plug

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.979 
nicer that way these are going to plug
in<00:02:29.980> plus<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.970> got<00:02:31.150> your<00:02:31.299> antenna<00:02:31.629> for<00:02:31.870> your

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
in plus you got your antenna for your

all that stuff in this is the new radio
and<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.709> factory<00:02:39.010> sample<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:40.090> had

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
and this is a factory sample so we had

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.539 
and this is a factory sample so we had
to<00:02:40.629> attach<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.019> wiring<00:02:41.200> harness<00:02:41.650> normally

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
to attach a wiring harness normally

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.770 
to attach a wiring harness normally
they're<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.879> come<00:02:43.060> with<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.329> Ford<00:02:43.540> plug

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
they're going to come with the Ford plug

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.390 
they're going to come with the Ford plug
already<00:02:44.140> done<00:02:44.319> but<00:02:44.500> we<00:02:44.620> use<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.980> Crutchfield

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
already done but we use to Crutchfield

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.869 
already done but we use to Crutchfield
plug<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.940> connect<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.019> together<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.670> you're

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
plug and connect it together so you're

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:49.979

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that's straight so we don't have to go

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.270 
that's straight so we don't have to go
through<00:02:53.109> this<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.590> can<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:53.859> plug<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.129> in<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
through this we can just plug it in the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.420 
through this we can just plug it in the
back<00:02:54.430> okay<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.739> because<00:02:56.739> what<00:02:57.160> we're<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.340> to

slightly into the weekend of your
receiver<00:03:24.510> we're<00:03:24.720> going<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.230> all<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.530> our

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
receiver we're going to have all of our

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.630 
receiver we're going to have all of our
wires<00:03:25.890> back<00:03:26.220> here<00:03:30.830> ok<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.100> reconnected<00:03:32.550> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
wires back here ok so we reconnected the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.070 
wires back here ok so we reconnected the
battery<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.060> tested<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.690> make<00:03:33.810> sure<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
battery and tested it to make sure that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.320 
battery and tested it to make sure that
it<00:03:34.140> works<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:34.890> if<00:03:35.400> anything<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:36.209> not

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
it works that way if anything is not

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.640 
it works that way if anything is not
connected<00:03:36.690> properly<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.200> pretty<00:03:37.410> easy<00:03:37.500> to

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
connected properly it's pretty easy to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160 
connected properly it's pretty easy to
fix<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.760> does<00:03:38.910> work<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.420> now<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.989> pop

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
fix so it does work and now we just pop

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
fix so it does work and now we just pop
the<00:03:40.380> dash<00:03:41.100> back<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.459> we've<00:03:41.550> got<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.790> mounted
