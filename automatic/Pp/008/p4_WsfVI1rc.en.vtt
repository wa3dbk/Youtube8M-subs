here for five days started out to be

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.160 
here for five days started out to be
just<00:00:14.950> a<00:00:15.250> little<00:00:15.369> small<00:00:15.789> pond<00:00:16.150> expansion<00:00:16.990> where

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
just a little small pond expansion where

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.540 
just a little small pond expansion where
we<00:00:17.289> were<00:00:17.380> going<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:17.560> dig<00:00:17.770> out<00:00:17.949> back<00:00:18.190> there<00:00:18.430> on

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
we were going to dig out back there on

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.870 
we were going to dig out back there on
the<00:00:18.670> backside<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.210> this<00:00:19.510> water<00:00:20.109> hole<00:00:20.730> see<00:00:21.730> the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
the backside of this water hole see the

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.810 
the backside of this water hole see the
original<00:00:22.269> concise<00:00:22.810> there<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.340> we<00:00:24.430> dug<00:00:24.610> out

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
original concise there but we dug out

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.480 
original concise there but we dug out
back<00:00:25.150> there<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.450> backside

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
back there on the backside

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.800 
back there on the backside
he<00:00:27.490> decided<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:27.910> was<00:00:28.119> looking<00:00:28.360> so<00:00:28.480> good<00:00:28.510> that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
he decided that was looking so good that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.529 
he decided that was looking so good that
he<00:00:28.900> just<00:00:29.640> expanded<00:00:30.640> upon<00:00:30.880> that<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.119> little<00:00:31.180> bit

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
he just expanded upon that a little bit

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.729 
he just expanded upon that a little bit
for<00:00:32.169> all<00:00:32.320> of<00:00:32.469> this<00:00:32.619> up<00:00:32.890> here<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:35.170> been<00:00:35.199> added

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
for all of this up here has been added

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.279 
for all of this up here has been added
problem<00:00:36.550> is<00:00:36.789> it's<00:00:37.000> all<00:00:37.149> just<00:00:37.449> hit<00:00:37.719> on<00:00:37.989> there

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
problem is it's all just hit on there

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.400 
problem is it's all just hit on there
wasn't<00:00:38.559> any<00:00:38.680> valley<00:00:38.980> here

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
wasn't any valley here

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.430 
wasn't any valley here
and<00:00:41.620> it's<00:00:41.830> all<00:00:42.010> pretty<00:00:42.310> hard<00:00:42.760> wet<00:00:43.690> sticky<00:00:44.110> clay

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
and it's all pretty hard wet sticky clay

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.440 
and it's all pretty hard wet sticky clay
so<00:00:44.950> it<00:00:44.980> hasn't<00:00:45.370> been<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.610> easiest<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.090> diggin

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
so it hasn't been the easiest to diggin

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.010 
so it hasn't been the easiest to diggin
and<00:00:46.830> down<00:00:47.830> about<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.910> foot<00:00:49.390> below<00:00:49.540> where<00:00:49.840> we're

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
and down about a foot below where we're

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.450 
and down about a foot below where we're
at

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
at

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.840 
at
there's<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.090> layer<00:00:52.300> shell<00:00:52.690> rock

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.639 

that<00:00:56.390> up<00:00:56.510> there<00:00:56.660> on<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.809> first<00:00:57.109> area<00:00:57.500> where

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
that up there on that first area where

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.259 
that up there on that first area where
we<00:00:57.710> dug<00:00:57.890> out<00:00:58.070> he<00:00:58.219> wanted<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.579> dug<00:00:58.730> her<00:00:58.969> down<00:00:59.120> to

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
we dug out he wanted it dug her down to

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.590 
we dug out he wanted it dug her down to
the<00:00:59.359> rock<00:00:59.539> of<00:01:00.289> course<00:01:00.589> once<00:01:00.769> we<00:01:00.829> did<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the rock of course once we did that the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.410 
the rock of course once we did that the
water<00:01:03.489> went<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.580> leaching<00:01:04.970> out<00:01:05.119> through<00:01:05.330> the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
water went to leaching out through the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.249 
water went to leaching out through the
rock<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:07.150> we<00:01:08.150> brought<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.479> up<00:01:08.600> about<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.869> foot<00:01:08.930> or

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
rock so we brought it up about a foot or

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.139 
rock so we brought it up about a foot or
so<00:01:09.290> above<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.830> rock<00:01:10.040> we<00:01:10.549> got<00:01:10.700> about<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.909> good

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
so above the rock we got about a good

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.660 
so above the rock we got about a good
full<00:01:11.390> inch<00:01:11.570> thick<00:01:11.810> hard<00:01:12.440> clay<00:01:12.799> layer<00:01:13.070> for<00:01:13.640> a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
full inch thick hard clay layer for a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.399 
full inch thick hard clay layer for a
liner<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.380> then<00:01:15.799> today<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:17.259> excavated<00:01:18.259> this

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
liner and then today I excavated this

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.139 
liner and then today I excavated this
nearest<00:01:18.860> bank<00:01:19.130> where<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> starts<00:01:19.940> curving

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
nearest bank where it starts curving

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.149 
nearest bank where it starts curving
around<00:01:20.509> here<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.990> had<00:01:21.320> some<00:01:21.530> real<00:01:21.710> good<00:01:21.890> red

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
around here and had some real good red

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.969 
around here and had some real good red
clay<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.960> threw<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.530> bottom<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
clay and so we threw that the bottom and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.649 
clay and so we threw that the bottom and
took<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.250> dozer<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.700> pushed<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:26.090> around<00:01:26.330> over

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
took the dozer and pushed it around over

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.450 
took the dozer and pushed it around over
into<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:26.930> area<00:01:27.049> I<00:01:27.350> dug<00:01:27.680> out<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.009> begin<00:01:28.130> with

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
into that area I dug out to begin with

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.740 
into that area I dug out to begin with
where<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.420> water<00:01:29.600> leaked<00:01:29.869> out<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.569> put

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
where the water leaked out and we put

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.410 
where the water leaked out and we put
about<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.020> 12<00:01:33.319> to<00:01:33.380> 18<00:01:33.860> inch<00:01:34.039> thick<00:01:34.310> red<00:01:35.119> clay

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
about a 12 to 18 inch thick red clay

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.350 
about a 12 to 18 inch thick red clay
liner<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.640> hopefully<00:01:37.640> that'll<00:01:37.819> seal<00:01:38.119> off

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
liner in that hopefully that'll seal off

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
liner in that hopefully that'll seal off
they<00:01:39.350> carefully

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
they carefully

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.000 
they carefully
now<00:01:41.940> we're<00:01:42.150> pulling<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:42.750> ramp<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.650> here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
now we're pulling out our ramp up here

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.460 
now we're pulling out our ramp up here
at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> North<00:01:44.250> End<00:01:45.980> we<00:01:46.980> use<00:01:47.160> this<00:01:47.400> ramp<00:01:48.470> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
at the North End we use this ramp to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.900 
at the North End we use this ramp to
push<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> ferret<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.550> hole<00:01:50.670> with

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
push the ferret up out of the hole with

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.060 
push the ferret up out of the hole with
the<00:01:51.030> dozer<00:01:51.240> while<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.080> was<00:01:52.320> digging<00:01:52.650> around<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the dozer while I was digging around the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.820 
the dozer while I was digging around the
banks<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:54.180> tobacco<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:56.610> customer

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
banks with tobacco the customer

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.550 
banks with tobacco the customer
specified<00:01:58.830> he<00:01:59.100> wanted<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.490> banks<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.940> be

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
specified he wanted the banks to be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.440 
specified he wanted the banks to be
nearly<00:02:01.560> vertical

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.560 

not<00:02:04.900> sloping

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.900 

not<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.619> way<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:08.740> normally<00:02:09.250> would<00:02:09.369> ever<00:02:09.520> do<00:02:09.700> one

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
not the way I normally would ever do one

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.340 
not the way I normally would ever do one
but<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.240> was<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.509> way<00:02:10.630> he<00:02:10.810> specifically

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
but that was the way he specifically

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.730 
but that was the way he specifically
wanted<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.130> we<00:02:12.490> had<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.760> dig<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> outer<00:02:13.240> oh

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
