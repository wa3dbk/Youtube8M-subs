00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
biome with hilly biome and there's a new

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
biome with hilly biome and there's a new
bio<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.640> haven't<00:01:27.060> played<00:01:27.180> Minecraft<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
bio I haven't played Minecraft in a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
bio I haven't played Minecraft in a
while<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> don't<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> biome<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
while so I don't know what the biome is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.050 
while so I don't know what the biome is
called<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> new<00:01:31.710> biome<00:01:33.619> from<00:01:35.060> 1.7.2

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
called but it is a new biome from 1.7.2

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
called but it is a new biome from 1.7.2
so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:37.979> what<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.340> played<00:01:38.549> got
