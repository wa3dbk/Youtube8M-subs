00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.600
 hello public very good day for all the 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.869
 today I bring hard for goal but 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.580
 now penguin room version 2 the version 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.100
 is the hash version like you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.760
 you can see 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.470
 this is a new game that is causing 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.050
 trend in devices ios 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.720
 guiding the first thing that you have 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.610
 what to do is connect the device that 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.500
 you have in my case I have 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.770
 android so by default this 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.770
 selection 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 here you have the options of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 gems and coins you can add 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.310
 from 35 gems that is the minimum inside 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.830
 of the game until 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.340
 the maximum but you can also add 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.410
 you rando that when brandon is a 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.130
 option that has allowed you to have more than 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.130
 1100 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.159
 when when are you going to buy them so 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.770
 you can have 2003 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.320
 same as they have 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.320
 10,000 but also 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.940
 that depends on 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.520
 and luck the stop 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.890
 and you can use it so many times 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.940
 as you want and I will teach you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.360
 and tablets to see with 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.340
 and stable is connected 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680
 so I'm going to teach them to see 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.020
 that if they browse the credits we're going to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.730
 wait for the game to open sometimes it's 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 a little slow as it is 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.180
 because this computer is not so powerful 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 true 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.310
 I charged 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.360
 this may take a correct 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.760
 and good as you can see 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.760
 I have my coins and nothing else 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.980
 can see 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.110
 you can leave 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.580
 or open but I would 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 to close them for him 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 Mrs 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.530
 [Music] 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.530
 and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.169
 [Music] 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.520
 you have android then select sandro 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.220
 the designer 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.990
 ok in my case I 'm going to select the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.990
 more random and 4 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.260
 and we give in aggregate 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.030
 do not disconnect your disk 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.329
 do not disconnect it, because if 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.280
 disconnect they will not receive anything and the 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.260
 game can fail them 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.330
 once you have appeared to them 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.820
 this warning 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.070
 will you say please close on the 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.470
 program the screen of your device 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.180
 they are going to pay the normal 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.230
 Now what we have to do is what 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.110
 following 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.830
 let's select the home button in 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.830
 some cases 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.300
 since we have closed it we hope 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.540
 Y 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.130
 and now we just have to wait 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.420
 since it opens the game and we can see already 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.420
 we have to add to the sierra 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:18.579
 we have more than 6,600 10 gems and more than 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:22.690
 400,000 gold coins now we are going to 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.410
 see if we can spend them and teach them 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.410
 example here 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.600
 as we can also buy characters 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.779
 for example 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.779
