white<00:00:32.640> we're<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> show<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.719> how<00:00:33.899> to

white we're going to show you how to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
white we're going to show you how to
duplicate<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.730> top<00:00:36.030> edge<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
duplicate that now this top edge of it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
duplicate that now this top edge of it
here<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.690> sort<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> faded<00:00:37.260> away<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.710> at

this<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:37.950> back<00:00:38.309> bit<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.329> cover

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this very back bit it's got this cover

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.650

line up the screw and there she is and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.260 
line up the screw and there she is and
that's<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.820> sits<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that's where that actually sits so

you're not going to see the seam itself
that<00:00:47.280> runs<00:00:47.460> through<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.329> you're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that runs through but this here you're
