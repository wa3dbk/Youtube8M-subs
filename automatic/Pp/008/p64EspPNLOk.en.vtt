00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.730
 hello marc favreau world of rome 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.009
 you agree to mark the day of the attempt and repeated 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.760
 if I tell you 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.900
 what were you doing for the kids this time for example the muc 72 and even 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.179
 before that 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.410
 the extraordinary movement that is expected from Lille by people who 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 are watching right now 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.300
 and then you miss a lot in the lead on the goblets 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.339
 there was a lot of pressure 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.880
 to do a lot 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.960
 the short rolled book is really saying freedom for people in the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.789
 world 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.460
 I think that we have experienced something exceptional in this sense capable of 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.020
 beat to prove 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.420
 products will have spotted guy get to the plot location on the screen and 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.910
 at all the trials we had something at the request of our 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.480
 consumers 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.950
 a few meters from the finish the peloton with all the drivers but 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.490
 rather right today 45 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.980
 specialists from each of the previous steps 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 in terms of cultures how do you use the fate of those who have 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.480
 sharing 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.570
 we are all here on the one hand never to pay attention 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.519
 proporta decrease in dividends 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.620
 for a family can share the task 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.940
 of course two next seasons of 2003 just amended each 15 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.260
 in the time we were doing 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 what can I say 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 otherwise we can still know today 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.180
 who should we go 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.540
 visit from Keflavik's kids to the wealth you thought about that 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.140
 before with this group and I do not consider the street baraban 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 right when children do not consider it because they cost 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.030
 so much took into account the parents who had been forced 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.000
 therefore suffered the conditions to participate in an Afghan state of which nearly 3 2 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.680
 million 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.190
 we are friends with the same vision of a big thing 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.740
 killer was targeted that has globalized so maybe it's for 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 it's a news item but hey it seems that kate the bar a little high 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.910
 performance relied on the fact that for example in November what can we 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.710
 have charlot everybody loves to watch 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 so that we were a pure so we take this time specifically to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 french car kids i saw him on anything order a 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.200
 something that interests us a lot helped in the beginning 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.430
 what we were told you have no decor 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.650
 having me no decor but not all because this exploit of the king still have 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.620
 strong axes of cynicism in a Chanel hand bath since yesterday a 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.120
 staircase from his sextape a serious turn and that it has us 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.259
 helped a lot 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.259
 the standards of debits like that is what I could draw 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.299
 we can say that it's a little bit like I needed to bargain 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.609
 I really was the direct is a little like that would say in this sense that if 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.339
 had to be by caam how a wooden city that the mission in the end 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.959
 of the day and in continuity to start over to the page and have finished 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.729
 in the end at 50 or 60 so we repeated part of the day to mater 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.419
 cameras in place how fever 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.529
