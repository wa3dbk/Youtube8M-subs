can show you lift here so this is one
this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> smaller<00:02:32.370> ones<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> that's<00:02:34.140> a

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
this is one the smaller ones so that's a

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.589 
this is one the smaller ones so that's a
waste<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.700> Russian<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
waste of this is Russian here this is a

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.600 
waste of this is Russian here this is a
PCA<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.440> because<00:02:37.890> I've<00:02:38.129> got<00:02:38.280> fine

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
European here which is expensive each

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.910 
European here which is expensive each
individual<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.110> lot<00:02:52.349> thicker<00:02:52.560> than<00:02:52.800> my

you'll be able to tell the difference
my<00:02:58.170> heels<00:02:58.470> are<00:02:58.620> very<00:02:58.890> different<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.610> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
my heels are very different to the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.180 
my heels are very different to the
texture<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.720> Russian<00:03:01.019> here<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.830> Russian

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
texture of the Russian here so Russian

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.300 
texture of the Russian here so Russian
individual<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.540> also<00:03:03.900> very<00:03:04.110> fine<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
individual here is also very fine so the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.869 
individual here is also very fine so the
texture<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.849> soft<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:07.379> also<00:03:08.069> can<00:03:08.400> become

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
texture is very soft it also can become

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.240 
texture is very soft it also can become
very<00:03:09.090> light<00:03:09.659> so<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.349> matches<00:03:10.560> my<00:03:10.860> hair<00:03:11.069> very

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
very light so it matches my hair very

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.540 
very light so it matches my hair very
well

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
well

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
because it's black they have to bleach

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.979 
because it's black they have to bleach
and<00:03:16.590> bleach<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:16.860> blue<00:03:16.980> chip<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:18.450> each<00:03:18.599> year<00:03:18.900> is

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.839 
and bleach and blue chip in each year is
very<00:03:19.200> thick<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:20.129> try<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.459> match<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.819> to

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
very thick so to try and match it to

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.300 
very thick so to try and match it to
blond<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.659> once<00:03:22.650> it's<00:03:22.800> been<00:03:22.950> really

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
bleached the texture of it's very

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.750 
bleached the texture of it's very
damaged<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.860> if<00:03:28.860> you've<00:03:29.010> got<00:03:29.190> black<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.430> thick
