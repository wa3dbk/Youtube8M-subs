00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 ManÃ© is about to see 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.210
 Ghana 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 i 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.940
 the current generation of the lion model 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.709
 the Spanish German brand seat is 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.230
 available in bodies of three and 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.669
 five doors and in the sc or family not 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.590
 you can find it with traction 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.020
 integral quattro drive designed for 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.609
 road and the latest evolution 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.989
 called experience already has 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.989
 possibilities all way 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.749
 and now what 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.659
 The experience is based on the version 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.789
 4x4 or 4 drive of l 7 that uses a 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.559
 haldex clutch of new generation and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.210
 equipped with electronic control for 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.299
 transmission of thrust torque to the shaft 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.890
 later this technology offers a 

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.479
 very fast acting as soon as 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.010
 detect adhesion losses in the 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.600
 front axle so it facilitates the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.399
 driving through complicated places 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.049
 roads in poor condition or in 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.979
 driving conditions with rain 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:59.979
 ice with snow 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.900
 this version is also distinguished because 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.390
 It carries a suspension that increases 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.150
 ground clearance to 172 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.110
 millimeters that are 27 millimeters more than 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.110
 in a lion st 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 the car has a length of 450 and 4 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 meters with a width of 182 meters and 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 a height of 148 meters 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.759
 outwardly the protections stand out 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.990
 of black plastic lining the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.119
 lower perimeter of the body 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.979
 from the bumpers to the doors 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.020
 including the wheel arches that 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.130
 They provide a more robust appearance and 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.130
 adventurous to the car 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.630
 inside the cabin and the 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.760
 trunk are the same as in the lion 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.680
 st although it changes the upholstery that is 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.390
 exclusive of this version and it combines 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.960
 leather and suede in different shades 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 of brown 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.349
 the trunk is large with 587 liters of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 capacity and can be extended by folding 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.040
 the rear seats 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.549
 also highlights a new screen 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 65-inch touchscreen that includes the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.269
 option to link by bluetooth two 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.269
 different mobile phones simultaneously 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.500
 we have tested the diesel version more 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.570
 powerful that manages to extract from the known 2 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.540
 liters of the force group pay a maximum 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.820
 of 184 horses that is 3 thousand 500 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.650
 and 4 thousand 500 revolutions per minute the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.410
 remarkable pair of thrust maintains its 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.000
 maximum value among the thousand 753 thousand 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.860
 revolutions per minute so that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.790
 we enjoyed a good push to almost 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.790
 any regime 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.260
 this version includes the change as standard 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.760
 automatic double clutch dsg of 6 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.470
 marches I've already used in several 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 models of the volkswagen group and it 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.100
 has the system this to be of 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.430
 automatic stop and start in 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.430
 detentions 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.189
 the lion experience exceeds the ton and 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.079
 average weight but the powerful turbo 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.389
 diesel allows you to accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.030
 kilometers per hour in 71 seconds and 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.810
 reach a maximum speed of 224 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.810
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.500
 the average consumption approved by seat is 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.570
 4.9 liters per 100 kilometers and in 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.820
 our test performed at a good pace and 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.130
 with the loaded car we have measured 72 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.750
 liters every 100 kilometers we think 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.700
 a correct figure for a car this 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.660
 approach and benefits although it is 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.660
 superior to the homologated 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.379
 the mode key in the center console 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.510
 allows the driver to choose between four 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.450
 driving modes called eco 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.609
 normal sport and individual that change the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.260
 character of the car remarkably the 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.939
 eco is designed to reduce 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.549
 Consumptions and harassment reacts in a 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.769
 smooth and progressive the normal offers more 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.630
 character and with a sport all the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 possible match to the motor set change 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.590
 the individual mode allows you to choose the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.949
 different parameters to the taste of each 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.949
 which one 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.430
 the suspension uses a scheme 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.110
 mcpherson forward and a set 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.230
 Rear multibrazo with bars 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.640
 stabilizers the set-up is 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.710
 very accomplished and the car offers a 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.690
 very good behavior it shows that the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.160
 center of gravity is a little higher 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.160
 but the reactions are noble and 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.140
 predictable on the road is better than 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.670
 any suv type SUV and it's 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.890
 much more agile in areas of curves 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.420
 linked though their possibilities were 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.420
 of the asphalt are more limited 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 the interior materials and finishes 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.939
 offers a high perceived quality and 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.699
 the position behind the wheel is fine 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:12.229
 made with good lateral support 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.110
 mechanical regulation of the lumbar support and 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.699
 a perfect support for the left foot 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.180
 the rear seats has departures 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.069
 of air 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.050
 of the air conditioner although the 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:23.050
 rear windows do not come down completely 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.740
 What we liked the most was the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.650
 balanced behavior as well as the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.490
 set motor change dsg and quality 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.490
 of materials and finishes 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.889
 has been the back central square and that 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.660
 the cams for changes in mode 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.660
 sequential turn with the steering wheel
