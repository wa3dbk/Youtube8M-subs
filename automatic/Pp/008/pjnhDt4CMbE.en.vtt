00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi today i have a do for you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 there self tutorial in which i show how 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 you can even make sugar scrub cubes 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.429
 these are hard blocks of my whole 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 body scrub all do 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.109
 yourself totally nice have fun what you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.769
 need is a fat or oil I use 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.310
 coconut fat is therefore really crazy about and 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:29.359
 sugar cube and soap if necessary 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.740
 want a fragrance essential oil and 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.489
 dye and glitter if you like that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 finds 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.090
 so this is really a bit optional this 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 do you need and in addition you have something 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 of mine for where do the entrance 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.730
 who can use those pins where 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 you make ice cubes 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.000
 and I have this once with one 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.750
 cook shop bought pillow vault again 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.910
 but i hear 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 same principle the exact amount 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 that need is 50 grams of fat or 100 oil 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 grams of soap and most of the cubes that are 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 100 grams and 150 grams of sugar and pack 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 usually a kilo 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.270
 the first thing we are going to do is it 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.270
 cut a very small piece of soap 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.619
 I am hurt now and cut into pieces 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.079
 now I am going to put it on the scales and 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 you take the coconut fat and I put 50 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.490
 gram from here 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.600
 now I mix this a bit well 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.630
 and we are going to put this in the microwave 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.620
 meanwhile, weigh your sugar 150 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.620
 grams 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.770
 if you don't have a microwave, you can do it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.760
 also put in a pan or a 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.110
 mare 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.220
 perhaps was put into the oven it goes 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.220
 really only because it melts 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.900
 we are going to do in short sessions 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.310
 always 10 seconds and then stir and 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.310
 then 13 seconds and sports 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.190
 both parties should have been doing and 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.350
 news is almost completely liquid 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.650
 quite a few lumps in but by the heat 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.480
 quickly pulled over and what you are going now 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.390
 do is you go little fragrance oil 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.830
 add and dye as you want so 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.600
 very nice he now smells like the box 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.270
 I have used you can anyway 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.770
 sentence uses who does and I'll do you one 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.280
 bit 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.700
 peppermint essential oil with a few 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.700
 drops 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.980
 I mix engines and then I do 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.980
 a little pink with food coloring 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.610
 showcase i get shock do what you do 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.370
 but likes then it's time 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.050
 to get the form because as soon as 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.140
 adding the sugar is going very fast 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.209
 and I do the sugar 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.570
 now hereby I go very quickly 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.570
 create 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.620
 kind of in viewer 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.620
 everything is in it now and it is still warm and 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.620
 since this is pretty flat side or 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.440
 top right is the way to go 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:53.700
 I pick up so carefully this year 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 with a knife when it is still warm enough 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.890
 the last few bits when sticking on the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.890
 places I still need 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.459
 well i also had glitter the i come there 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.830
 but I have a nice idea 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.640
 just throw it up a bit here 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.640
 and pressing 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.880
 now just push it a bit like this 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.370
 and I now let you cool down the fastest 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.290
 way is to put it in the freezer 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.669
 then take their analysis off again 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.560
 fish 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.860
 and now you can get out of shape very easily 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.860
 to press 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.900
 and now they are ready you can put them on one 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.699
 put a nice bowl down but you can do it 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.900
 also very nice storage 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.900
 for example in a glass jar 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.080
 you can also decorate the pot nicely 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.860
 by putting a nice ribbon around it with 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.860
 something of a pendant 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.970
 and this is super cute in the bathroom 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.190
 I told you right away how you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.330
 such a scrub block is best 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.410
 use 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.270
 you actually always use it under 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.820
 so the shower or bath is when you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.100
 skin is wet first make your skin well wet 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.820
 and then move the block over you 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.940
 skin 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.530
 you script it directly with the block 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.810
 when you're done , rinse it again 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.030
 and your skin will be very soft it 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.460
 pants is not after a time you can 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.800
 even really fall a few times 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.510
 so make sure it dries well 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.000
 keeps by for example on a 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.740
 soap dish and I often have one 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.690
 soap dish where I have special soaps 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.110
 save and like color block you 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.110
 and so on 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.600
 thanks for watching and see you soon 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.830
 Yes
