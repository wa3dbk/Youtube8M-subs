00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.119
 Good morning, good afternoon. Good night to spend you. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.500
 following our comments on moving about model interpretation 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.799
 study of trends in the area tried to give 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 as the courses we were offered on show marlos out of fashion dot net 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.289
 are webtv courses 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.960
 online support 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.460
 I chose this piece this dress here 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.589
 for two reasons 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.790
 who uses this minimum note list 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.940
 this stamp as scrap that in the 80's we called compostela 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.690
 She's coming back, so we're going to start having 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 and she can play with these details 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.530
 in this part 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.579
 what I observe is that she was your user in a very 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 intelligent 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.280
 see that the darkest part is looking for river and is the driest part 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 area in the pocket 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.610
 this composition favors the triangle body 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.100
 the band in the meeting fear it is the side nanana tie ' 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.190
 he 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.310
 it's a counterpoint 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.000
 and that it gives a little bit of normal a pattern as vast as this 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.040
 Let's turn our backs on the vacancy. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 it's a fault it's a tubby dress 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 the designer and that without the track 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 it is understood the autodata puts them a riot 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 in saints the year 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810
 he notes that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.390
 what I want to move and so many acquisitions 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 on here 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 erick despite being basic is not 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.679
 used a modeling feature that 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.629
 more effective in the general context of the model 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.229
 a graceful 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.629
 and this in an update leaving the part that would be 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.569
 much of the revenue 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.259
 I did not kill soon 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.839
 most current 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.059
 see that the team has a preview 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.909
 soon there is another novelty of this channel in a third 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.040
 in the other 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.189
 direction 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.929
 these bullshit 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.929
 they do two things at once 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.649
 they are 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.649
 the resource for strained waist 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.089
 and to camouflage 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.769
 others have indexes 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.139
 that are made in the neckline that in the letters 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.729
 why this piece looks perfectly fine because you have not 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.250
 is courteous open each cycle 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 the papo 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.179
 the bet 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:09.749
 So 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.889
 this was an insane feature of crazy 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.889
 which was used in modeling 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.109
 suit 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.469
 the piece to the contour to the shape of the human body 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.090
 ae-ap she takes 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.420
 the same 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.970
 the same detail see what she has is what she evaluates 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.209
 some grimaces 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.399
 this also leave your waist the scoreboard and sumol the piece on the body in a way 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.629
 well marked 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.809
 the production to choose here 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.749
 transvestite this person who is so accented of the 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:57.219
 mounted on the body was just here 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.699
 It was cook asking is invisible. 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.699
 neckline 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.529
 up until 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:11.399
 the area the beginning of the comic then the italy in the middle you can see the pulse 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.829
 abduct small cut 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.640
 the performance of cyrus 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640
 so I made 3 to 3 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:21.059

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.259

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.000
 I had said our course pre-crisis industrial modeling 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.110
 You'll learn how to interpret models. 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.910

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.949

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.749
 cost us to help this frenzy in our channel 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.969
 Let us give our work because the more visits we have had 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.300

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.600
 but there is not a condition we'll have to be doing more than it's better to
