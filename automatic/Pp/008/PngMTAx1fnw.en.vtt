of the LPP kunig Adam today I am showing
you<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.639> big<00:00:11.910> planet<00:00:12.179> Vita<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.340> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
you a big planet Vita and I know the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.960 
you a big planet Vita and I know the
quality<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.849> not<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> greatest

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
quality is not going to be the greatest

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.540 
quality is not going to be the greatest
that's<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.359> I'm<00:00:18.480> recording<00:00:18.779> from<00:00:19.550> phone

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
that's because I'm recording from phone

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
that's because I'm recording from phone
because<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.720> know<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> Vita<00:00:22.170> doesn't<00:00:22.500> let

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
because you know the Vita doesn't let

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
because you know the Vita doesn't let
you<00:00:22.769> record<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> actual<00:00:25.680> screen<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.210> any

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you record the actual screen or with any

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.790 
you record the actual screen or with any
device<00:00:27.720> such<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.980> PSP<00:00:29.400> did<00:00:29.779> but<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:31.619> going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
device such as the PSP did but I'm going

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200 
device such as the PSP did but I'm going

to give it to you as best as I can like
this<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.600> now<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.070> hopefully<00:00:35.070> we'll<00:00:35.460> find

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this for now and hopefully we'll find

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.520 
this for now and hopefully we'll find
something<00:00:35.969> better<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.540> future<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
something better in the future but in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.600 
something better in the future but in
this<00:00:37.649> tutorial<00:00:37.829> I'm<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.489> showing

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this tutorial I'm going to be showing

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.660 
this tutorial I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> memorizer<00:00:40.670> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
you how to use the memorizer the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.139 
you how to use the memorizer the
memorizer<00:00:42.239> basically<00:00:43.129> stores<00:00:44.129> data<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
memorizer basically stores data in the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
memorizer basically stores data in the
level<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.629> once<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> trigger<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
level so once you trigger it inside a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
level so once you trigger it inside a
level<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.329> stay<00:00:48.539> triggered<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> next

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
level it will stay triggered the next

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
level it will stay triggered the next
time<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.500> join<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> decide<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> save<00:00:50.760> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
time they join if you decide to save it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
time they join if you decide to save it
meaning<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.750> save<00:00:54.989> data<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
meaning that you can make save data so

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
meaning that you can make save data so
for<00:00:55.710> example<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
for example you could make it so the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.410 
for example you could make it so the
player<00:00:57.660> keeps<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.109> currency<00:00:59.059> which<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.210> nice

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
player keeps a currency which is nice

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
player keeps a currency which is nice
and<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.260> could<00:01:01.410> also<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:01.949> level<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and you could also do it from level to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
and you could also do it from level to
level<00:01:02.699> which<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> brilliant<00:01:03.600> i<00:01:03.899> only<00:01:04.080> found

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
level which is brilliant i only found

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
level which is brilliant i only found
that<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.500> today<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> could<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> chip

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that out today so you could have a chip

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.250 
that out today so you could have a chip
called<00:01:07.350> test<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> second

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
called test here and then in the second

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.510 
called test here and then in the second
level<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.560> could<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> chip<00:01:11.040> called<00:01:11.220> test

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
level you could have a chip called test

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.090 
level you could have a chip called test
and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.600> did<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.830> data

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and then when i did have the same data

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.570 
and then when i did have the same data
type<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> set<00:01:15.060> off<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.420> same

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
type that would be set off the same

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.090 
type that would be set off the same
which<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.600> helpful<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
which is really really helpful for you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.539 
which is really really helpful for you
know<00:01:20.220> RPG<00:01:20.970> other<00:01:21.479> game<00:01:22.140> makers<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.770> LTS<00:01:23.369> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

that<00:01:23.670> i'm<00:01:23.759> working<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.390> myself<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> let's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that i'm working on now myself so let's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.600 
that i'm working on now myself so let's
just<00:01:27.240> show<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> basically<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.170> does

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
just show you basically what it does

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
just show you basically what it does
here<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> settings<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.920> see

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
here the settings and as you can see

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
here the settings and as you can see
it's<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:33.090> old<00:01:33.270> invert<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.530> can

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's got a good old invert and you can

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.280 
it's got a good old invert and you can
have<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.310> many<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> want<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> number

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have as many as you want like a number

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
have as many as you want like a number
of<00:01:37.380> ports<00:01:38.479> obviously<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.200> set<00:01:40.439> off

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of ports obviously it would set off

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
of ports obviously it would set off
certain<00:01:40.920> logic<00:01:41.070> depending<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.790> which<00:01:41.970> ones

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
certain logic depending on which ones

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.550 
certain logic depending on which ones
you<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.960> input<00:01:44.689> then<00:01:46.820> also<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.329> has

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
you actually input then also it has

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.109 
you actually input then also it has
unhear<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> input<00:01:50.189> obviously<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.780> too

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
unhear the input obviously that's too

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.940 
unhear the input obviously that's too
obviously<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> trigger<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.380> turn

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
obviously a trigger it and make it turn

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
obviously a trigger it and make it turn
on<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.229> trigger<00:01:59.119> now<00:02:00.119> both<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
on and this is the trigger now both of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.889 
on and this is the trigger now both of
these<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:02.360> both<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
these have to be both these have to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
these have to be both these have to
receive<00:02:04.229> an<00:02:04.409> input<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.759> activate<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.229> make

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
receive an input to activate it to make

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.919 
receive an input to activate it to make
it<00:02:07.530> stay<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.720> another

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it stay on and then you can have another

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.960 
it stay on and then you can have another
button<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.590> slot<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.700> would

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
button in this slot here which would

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.510 
button in this slot here which would
make<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.300> reset

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
make it reset

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630 
make it reset
this<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.870> trigger<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.410> what<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.220> need<00:02:18.489> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
this is the trigger so what you need to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.800 
this is the trigger so what you need to
do<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.680> want<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:21.010> button<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.690> need

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
do if you want a button to so you need

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.140 
do if you want a button to so you need
to<00:02:22.900> press<00:02:23.020> two<00:02:23.230> buttons<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:23.770> example<00:02:24.280> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
to press two buttons for example you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.600 
to press two buttons for example you
could<00:02:25.780> make<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.440> both<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:26.980> those<00:02:27.310> are

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
could make it so both of those are

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.790 
could make it so both of those are
required<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.330> make<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:28.989> one<00:02:29.200> go<00:02:29.319> off<00:02:29.530> well

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
required to make this one go off well

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
required to make this one go off well
you<00:02:30.400> get<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:30.880> idea<00:02:30.970> once<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.480> actually<00:02:31.599> get<00:02:31.840> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you get the idea once you actually get a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.420 
you get the idea once you actually get a
hold<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.080> yourself<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.620> all<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.190> need<00:02:33.340> to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
hold of yourself but all you need to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.370 
hold of yourself but all you need to
know<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> activate<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.360> put<00:02:34.540> two<00:02:34.840> wires

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
know is to activate it you put two wires

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.089 
know is to activate it you put two wires
into<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.239> your<00:02:37.360> output<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.099> this

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
into here this is your output and this

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.559 
into here this is your output and this
is<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.400> logic<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:39.819> activated<00:02:40.390> by<00:02:40.540> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
is the logic that's activated by the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.770 
is the logic that's activated by the
output<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.060> part<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.420> saves

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
output so this is the part that saves

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.949 
output so this is the part that saves
here<00:02:44.200> after<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:44.920> part<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> anything<00:02:46.600> after

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
here after this part so anything after

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.270 
here after this part so anything after
here<00:02:47.140> saves<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.090> let<00:02:49.780> me<00:02:49.810> show<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.739> play

you<00:03:32.170> can't<00:03:32.410> do<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.680> from<00:03:32.739> here<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.040> guess<00:03:33.280> you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
you can't do it from here I guess you

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160 
you can't do it from here I guess you
have<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.549> do<00:03:33.700> from<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.970> pod<00:03:34.150> book<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.959> show

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
have to do from the pod book and show

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.580 
have to do from the pod book and show
you<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.380> now<00:03:35.590> actually<00:03:36.040> return<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.640> pod<00:03:37.590> so

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
you that now actually return to pod so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.930 
you that now actually return to pod so
you<00:03:38.650> saw<00:03:38.890> whenever<00:03:39.250> reached<00:03:39.489> at<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.819> level

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
you saw whenever reached at that level

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.550 
you saw whenever reached at that level
that<00:03:40.090> light<00:03:40.359> was<00:03:40.480> on<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:41.140> will<00:03:41.290> do<00:03:41.410> it

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that light was on that will do it

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.830 
that light was on that will do it
forever<00:03:41.980> because<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.060> logic<00:03:43.359> has<00:03:43.450> been<00:03:43.600> set

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
forever because that logic has been set

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.900 
forever because that logic has been set
off<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.079> saved<00:03:44.380> so<00:03:45.069> what<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.280> need<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.730> now

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
off and saved so what I need to do now

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.020 
off and saved so what I need to do now
is<00:03:45.940> go<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.209> settings<00:03:47.040> my<00:03:48.040> name<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.280> data<00:03:48.519> labels

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
is go to settings my name is data labels

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.229 
is go to settings my name is data labels
now<00:03:49.180> using<00:03:49.720> C<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.489> then<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.639> got<00:03:51.760> my<00:03:51.970> name<00:03:52.000> on

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239

there and it has protector removed so

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.250 
there and it has protector removed so
protect<00:03:56.170> would<00:03:56.350> mean<00:03:56.530> if<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.900> protect<00:03:58.900> it<00:03:59.109> and

protect would mean if you protect it and
press<00:03:59.500> removal<00:04:00.780> then<00:04:01.889> there's<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:02.950> button<00:04:03.130> that

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
press removal then there's a button that

says<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.190> book<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.519> probably<00:04:12.670> can't
