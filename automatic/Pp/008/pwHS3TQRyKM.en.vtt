00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
happen and I don't see it being a

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.309 
happen and I don't see it being a
problem<00:04:57.819> with<00:04:58.360> like<00:04:58.569> two<00:04:58.810> players<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.259> team

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319
