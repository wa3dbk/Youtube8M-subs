00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.870
 the biggest challenge of the evening 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.870
 to be healthy again on the ground 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.090
 rolf mountains is helicopter pilot and 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.450
 flies on behalf of rwe once a year 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.860
 Power lines with only five to ten 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.300
 meter distance he flies to the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.699
 power transmission lines zoom 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.539
 only experienced pilots are for this 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.189
 work suitable 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.519
 the flight is not completely safe 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.620
 because the lines are under 110,000 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.570
 volt voltage and flown so far 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.780
 that the aw's colleagues are also what 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.199
 so yes, so fly so close 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.390
 tuned 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.969
 depending on what you see , it also shows 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.969
 times closer to that they damage because even 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.020
 from the distance the lakes and 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.199
 can give you an opinion 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.030
 and that's what the flight is all about 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.550
 line fitter of the rwe check the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.500
 Power lines from the air 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.660
 Specialists control the complete 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.039
 mains supply in 30 meters above the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.679
 ground line ropes insulators die 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:13.960
 pylons everything with the 110 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.490
 kilovolt strong high voltage has to do 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 rainer kurek flies at the controls 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.420
 already for 30 years a flight without 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.370
 There is hardly any result 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.980
 every little thing will hurt 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.830
 found and documented and later by 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.880
 the installers fixed the most common 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.710
 damage is due to damage 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.780
 lightning strike like this burned 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.520
 traces on the insulator or on the line 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.960
 You look for these mistakes and you have one 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.050
 small internal list and says it 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.800
 Smaller the error is big mistake 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.600
 everyone thinks so everybody sees everyone 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.460
 only this very clearly hurries that me 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.340
 already a challenge and that was already 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.840
 a little fun 7500 power poles and 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 Rainer kurek adds 2300 kilometers 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.300
 his field of operation from eight to ten 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 weeks will take the inspection in the not 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.420
 In addition, his colleagues are on foot 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 on the way and control from the ground 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.420
 From the helicopter has the advantage 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.429
 that we will be in no time 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.200
 know what our network says where the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.120
 weak spots are that we are so very 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 can act quickly and the net 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.010
 always tiptop because only one 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.630
 supply network in good condition ensures 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.110
 also the power supply for the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.110
 consumer
