00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
get the Kiwis to give the batter a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.220 
get the Kiwis to give the batter a
little<00:02:16.980> bit<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.489> moisture<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.959> sticks

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
little bit of moisture so that it sticks

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.460 
little bit of moisture so that it sticks
together<00:02:20.120> okay<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> always<00:02:22.080> tell<00:02:22.350> your

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
together okay you can always tell your

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.900 
together okay you can always tell your
batters<00:02:22.800> ready<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.400> pick<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.730> like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
batters ready when you pick it up like

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.820 
batters ready when you pick it up like
this<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.480> squeeze<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.080> holds

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
this and you squeeze it it holds

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.860 
this and you squeeze it it holds
together<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> springform<00:02:27.300> pan<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
together so a springform pan is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.720 
together so a springform pan is
absolutely<00:02:28.650> fantastic<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.489> can

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
absolutely fantastic because you can

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.610 
absolutely fantastic because you can
remove<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.239> while<00:02:30.360> retaining<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> shape<00:02:31.140> so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
remove it while retaining the shape so

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.020 
remove it while retaining the shape so
we<00:02:31.769> take<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.010> springform<00:02:32.550> pan<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
we take that springform pan and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.250 
we take that springform pan and
typically<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.540> other<00:02:33.720> people<00:02:34.019> are<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
typically if other people are going to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380 
typically if other people are going to
bake<00:02:34.440> with<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:34.860> want<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> lip<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.549> we

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
bake with it they want the lip up we

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.630 
bake with it they want the lip up we
want<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.780> lip<00:02:36.959> down<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.010> put<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> lip<00:02:38.430> down

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
want the lip down so we put the lip down

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.789 
want the lip down so we put the lip down
and<00:02:38.850> then<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.060> saran<00:02:39.360> wrap<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.650> easy

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
and then we saran wrap it so it's easy

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.440 
and then we saran wrap it so it's easy
for<00:02:41.040> us<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.130> slide<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.730> without<00:02:42.030> using<00:02:42.329> any

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
for us to slide it off without using any

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.990 
for us to slide it off without using any

many Kiwis was that books that was
taught<00:03:24.150> all<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.540> one<00:03:24.750> is

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
right so in the Vitamix it would have

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.520 
right so in the Vitamix it would have
come<00:05:49.550> out<00:05:49.580> smoother<00:05:50.210> than<00:05:50.240> this<00:05:50.540> but<00:05:51.290> I<00:05:51.320> think

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
come out smoother than this but I think

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.010 
come out smoother than this but I think
that's<00:05:51.980> pretty<00:05:52.220> smooth<00:05:52.700> so<00:05:53.360> typically<00:05:53.870> you

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
that's pretty smooth so typically you

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.050 
that's pretty smooth so typically you
would<00:05:54.170> take<00:05:54.350> this<00:05:54.500> cake<00:05:54.770> if<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.550> had<00:05:55.880> been<00:05:56.030> a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
would take this cake if it had been a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.400 
would take this cake if it had been a
cooked<00:05:56.330> cake<00:05:56.600> and<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.840> would<00:05:56.990> put<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.290> in<00:05:57.380> the

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
cooked cake and you would put it in the

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.250 
cooked cake and you would put it in the
oven<00:05:57.800> right<00:05:57.980> well<00:05:58.850> what<00:05:59.030> we<00:05:59.210> would<00:05:59.360> do<00:05:59.600> is<00:05:59.870> to

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
oven right well what we would do is to

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.320 
oven right well what we would do is to
set<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.530> mousse<00:06:00.860> up<00:06:01.100> a<00:06:01.220> little<00:06:01.460> bit<00:06:01.640> we<00:06:02.150> would

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
set the mousse up a little bit we would

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.510 
set the mousse up a little bit we would
put<00:06:02.510> it<00:06:02.600> in<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.780> freezer<00:06:03.130> you<00:06:04.130> could<00:06:04.280> put<00:06:04.430> it

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
put it in the freezer you could put it

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.460 
put it in the freezer you could put it
in<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.640> freezer<00:06:04.880> for<00:06:05.030> like<00:06:05.360> 25<00:06:05.810> minutes<00:06:05.840> and

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
in the freezer for like 25 minutes and

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.230 
in the freezer for like 25 minutes and
then<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:07.490> mousse<00:06:07.670> would<00:06:07.880> be<00:06:08.030> nicely

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
then the mousse would be nicely

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.810 
then the mousse would be nicely
solidified<00:06:09.070> okay

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.860 

and<00:06:13.390> that

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.240 

is<00:06:18.020> our<00:06:18.620> beautiful<00:06:20.530> three-layer<00:06:22.000> kiwi<00:06:23.000> tape
