would want to build your own training

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.750 
would want to build your own training
gear<00:00:35.660> instead<00:00:35.960> of<00:00:36.140> purchasing<00:00:36.560> a<00:00:36.739> set<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.280> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
materials are obviously going to be

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.770 
materials are obviously going to be
different<00:02:34.850> because<00:02:35.209> they<00:02:35.390> have<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.660> be

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
different because they have to be

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.160 
different because they have to be
lightweight<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.280> still<00:02:37.640> remain<00:02:38.170> quite

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
lightweight and still remain quite

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.660 
lightweight and still remain quite
strong<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.870> actual<00:02:42.320> building<00:02:42.500> process<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.550> go

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
strong the actual building process I go

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.330 
strong the actual building process I go
over<00:02:43.820> sizing<00:02:44.450> them<00:02:44.600> which<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.680> basically<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
over sizing them which is basically the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.729 
over sizing them which is basically the
same<00:02:46.370> again<00:02:46.940> different<00:02:47.330> materials<00:02:47.780> but<00:02:48.020> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
same again different materials but the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.040 
same again different materials but the
sizing<00:02:49.100> methods<00:02:49.430> are<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.760> same<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.870> we

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
sizing methods are the same and then we

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.680 
sizing methods are the same and then we
go<00:02:51.200> over<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.890> basic<00:02:52.459> four<00:02:52.730> steps<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.300> building

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
go over the basic four steps of building

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.850 
go over the basic four steps of building
which<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.080> stick<00:02:54.920> prep<00:02:55.250> ball<00:02:55.970> prep<00:02:56.470> hub<00:02:57.470> prep

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
which is stick prep ball prep hub prep

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.150 
which is stick prep ball prep hub prep
and<00:02:58.100> then<00:02:59.110> actually<00:03:00.110> assembling<00:03:00.739> them<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
and then actually assembling them and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.310 
and then actually assembling them and
then<00:03:01.550> finally<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.060> go<00:03:02.209> on<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.630> attaching<00:03:02.959> them

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
then finally we go on to attaching them

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.440 
then finally we go on to attaching them
onto<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:03.980> microbes<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.550> micros<00:03:05.300> you

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
onto the microbes and micros you

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.150 
onto the microbes and micros you
generally<00:03:05.900> attach<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.410> little<00:03:06.650> bit<00:03:06.800> different

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
generally attach a little bit different

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.430 
generally attach a little bit different
again<00:03:07.640> because<00:03:08.030> you're<00:03:08.239> dealing<00:03:09.049> with<00:03:09.080> weight

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
again because you're dealing with weight

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.900 
again because you're dealing with weight
restrictions<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.400> wouldn't<00:03:10.640> use<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
restrictions so you wouldn't use the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.539 
restrictions so you wouldn't use the
same<00:03:11.590> necessarily<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.709> same<00:03:12.890> method<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.459> you

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
same necessarily the same method so you

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.430 
same necessarily the same method so you
would<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.209> use<00:03:14.540> for<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.810> larger<00:03:15.200> set<00:03:15.410> of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
would you just use for a larger set of

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.800 
would you just use for a larger set of
RC<00:03:15.830> helicopters<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> talked<00:03:17.239> about<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> few

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
RC helicopters so I talked about a few

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.750 
RC helicopters so I talked about a few
mounting<00:03:18.769> methods<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.250> work<00:03:19.430> really<00:03:19.640> well

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
mounting methods that work really well

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.590 
mounting methods that work really well
and<00:03:20.440> then<00:03:21.440> chapter<00:03:21.739> 8<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.430> actual<00:03:22.790> that's

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
and then chapter 8 is the actual that's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.740 
and then chapter 8 is the actual that's
final<00:03:24.049> chapter<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.560> ebook<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.100> it's<00:03:26.060> some

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
final chapter of the ebook and it's some

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.780 
final chapter of the ebook and it's some

training<00:03:36.440> gear<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.799> talked<00:03:37.519> about<00:03:37.549> when<00:03:37.940> you

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
training gear I talked about when you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.210 
training gear I talked about when you
might<00:03:38.209> want<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.510> use<00:03:38.630> sealer<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.260> then<00:03:39.860> we<00:03:40.070> go

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
might want to use sealer and then we go

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.160 
might want to use sealer and then we go
over<00:03:40.250> training<00:03:40.910> your<00:03:41.060> vibrations<00:03:41.720> which<00:03:41.959> can

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
over training your vibrations which can

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.920 
over training your vibrations which can
be<00:03:42.260> quite<00:03:42.470> common<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.239> fit<00:03:44.630> training

be quite common when you fit training
gear<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.560> go<00:03:45.739> over<00:03:45.890> ways<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.930> eliminate<00:03:48.040> and

reduce while reduce and hopefully

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.020 
reduce while reduce and hopefully
eliminate<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.650> vibrations<00:03:52.519> all<00:03:52.700> together

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
eliminate the vibrations all together

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.509 
eliminate the vibrations all together
