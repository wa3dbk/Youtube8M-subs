00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
difference especially in the Steelers

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.550 
difference especially in the Steelers
case<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> adding<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> guy<00:01:27.659> who<00:01:28.320> where

case because you adding a guy who where

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
case because you adding a guy who where
there<00:01:28.710> still<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> weakness<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.579> speed<00:01:29.850> you're

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
there still is weakness is speed you're

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.380 
there still is weakness is speed you're
adding<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.630> 98<00:01:31.020> speed<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.950> six<00:01:32.340> feet<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> good

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
adding a 98 speed with six feet and good

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
adding a 98 speed with six feet and good
catching<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> those<00:01:34.890> types<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.400> changes<00:01:35.610> will

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
catching so those types of changes will

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
catching so those types of changes will
make<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> huge<00:01:36.210> difference<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.170> definitely

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
make a huge difference and definitely

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
make a huge difference and definitely
possibly<00:01:38.759> even<00:01:38.880> move<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.299> team<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.930> tier<00:01:40.259> as

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
possibly even move a team up a tier as

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.609 
possibly even move a team up a tier as

out of the bunch and him coming back to
the<00:02:02.490> Saints<00:02:03.229> obviously<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the Saints obviously is going to have a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.590 
the Saints obviously is going to have a
huge<00:02:05.009> impact<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.549> real<00:02:05.790> life<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.329> on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
huge impact in real life but also on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809 
huge impact in real life but also on
matted<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.380> their<00:02:08.009> defense<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.520> really

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
matted because their defense is really

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.270 
matted because their defense is really
solid<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> could<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> lot

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
solid right now but it could be a lot

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.100 
solid right now but it could be a lot
better<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.940> still<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> tier<00:02:12.870> 2

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
better I still have them as a tier 2

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
better I still have them as a tier 2
team<00:02:13.349> but<00:02:13.560> with

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
team but with

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
team but with
filming<00:02:14.190> them<00:02:14.400> returning<00:02:14.790> they<00:02:15.450> could

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
filming them returning they could

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.860 
filming them returning they could
definitely<00:02:15.960> move<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.590> ranks<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.160> sure

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
