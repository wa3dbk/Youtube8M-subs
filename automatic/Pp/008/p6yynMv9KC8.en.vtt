 Game flow-like structures on the surface 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 I thought 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.560
 that's just wonderful in spite of the former coach

 after seven years, the American-European supposedly got the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.610
 Weapons to Saturn with the mission critical scientific questions 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 to clarify

 Usain Bolt was a super info now where do the planet earth come from, how are they 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 originated and grown as they have changed 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.470
 I would like to ask very basic questions about the biggest 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.720
 it is not strange that we have life on a planet like that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.900
 Cosmos brought forth to us 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.230
 For answers to these questions, check out the box office mission on Saturn 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.590
 the big gaseous planet 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 in his speech 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.990
 as is now known that the water ice and rocks exist 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.660
 and also his mysterious months 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.250
 62 are known so far, one of them is very interesting 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.949
 This is especially the Saturn has a crown jewel called Titan 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.510
 he is the only moment with an atmosphere in the earth

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.629
 for that, Bittgang percent should be the presence of methane 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.649
 responsible for a complex organic chemistry 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.269
 One of the goals of the mission is to understand how complex it is here 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.269
 Operations are the criticisms that have been placed so far 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.170
 the ones collected by Cassini there 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.830
 Data suggest that methane is not the only liquid on the planet yet

 Titanium is

 that led to life on our planet 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.329
 crucial for the emergence of life on earth before four billion 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.379
 years 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.550
 Similar processes would also be conceivable on the Titan

 he drove the purchase of the Opel Vectra the fact that I over the South Pole one

 Cloud of water vapor means that is a source of heat inside the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.770
 The moon had to give nuclear power that is really surprising the Lancelot that 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.840
 is very small and should have been cool since its emergence actually 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.400
 So there is a heat source that we do not yet understand 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.360
 widely visible flags of water vapor and ice particles rise from the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.159
 Surface of the moon 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.569
 this causes the researchers to believe that this is the numbers 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.569
 even inside Lancelot it is liquid water 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.720

 in fact, there is water everywhere 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.740

 MS fluid can go through the entire solar system we have to go from scratch 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.220
 start and our search for life and habitable places 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.220
