00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone with you maracasi that's it 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.160
 new update 083 new 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.099
 Chinese tanks and as always need 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.400
 look for suitable mods for the game I decided 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.230
 make your own mods build 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.160
 mods that make the game more convenient and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.890
 more interesting these mods i always download and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 add to the game because they really 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.930
 help to play better and in this video I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 I will tell about these mods 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.770
 and there will be links in the description under 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 video you can download every mod called 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 individually or download the whole build 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.149
 and so start with the mods that are in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 me in the hangar 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:49.289
 as you see the hangar has changed here there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.090
 such a winter forest that was about 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.789
 the new year is the same but then it was removed 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.129
 This hangar is almost as well, there is no 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.030
 Christmas tree and some more small 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 Details the next mod adds a clock to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.049
 hangar is always important to know how much now 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 time the next mod changes 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.229
 rather it adds new columns with 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.409
 statistics in the achievements appeared here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.659
 for example the exact percentage of wins how many 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.320
 you need to win to increase the percentage of victories 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.880
 as well as average damage 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 you can see the same on each 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.600
 Tank very useful mod is always it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 I put useful for those who are looking for a player in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.570
 platoon or company 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 or the next mod adds to the clan 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.579
 session statistics here you can 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.070
 see how much has grown won what u 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.009
 you percentage of victories and how much money you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.079
 nafarmili here for example the moment I 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.610
 already gone into minus 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:00.380
 I recommend a useful mod to everyone, so let's see 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.360
 what kind of mods i use sing 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.149
 firstly i always use mod 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.039
 deer meter or as they call it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.190
 a percentage of which shows 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.860
 moment, as it were, until the players are always yours 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.849
 know who you are playing with and against whom you are 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.069
 playing this mod is also useful because 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.750
 he has a great addition which 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:27.110
 shows how much damage is made for a fight 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.390
 Right now I have inflicted 1606 upper damage 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.280
 on the left you can see it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.530
 also this addition shows how much 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.240
 people in front of the base 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.240
 how much time is left to capture the base 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.769
 using also the damage panel which 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.680
 shows how much you wrote the damage 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:53.370
 for a shot for example now I once 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.390
 inflicted damage on 454 and in the lower left 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.099
 the corner you can see it how are you 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.629
 can see also there is an indicator 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.349
 which shows where in me 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.480
 fired it is useful that you can 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:12.209
 find out the approximate location of the enemy 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.829
 no plum and vanilla next mod changes 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.200
 I have 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.260
 light bulb now looks more light 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.620
 noticeable so here I began to use 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.239
 constantly because it's a sweetie much 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.769
 more like something standard and 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:34.170
 Note that this light only works. 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.730
 with the x-wing mod canes meter otherwise she 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.040
 most likely you will not work but 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.609
 as a complete description 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.660
 I don't know for sure either of course 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.959
 new sight that I use already 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.810
 a long time ago I first used the sight from 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.209
 Jova well this is also a very good sight 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.129
 at least in spite of the fact that he 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.560
 so fancy 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:05.620
 still it interferes with playing and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.180
 allows you to target enemies well and so 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.640
 the next mod will be especially useful 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.950
 my art guide because it shows 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.910
 the angles of horizontal guidance ipad and 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:20.980
 and uart very interesting mod and useful 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.680
 it must also leave it on 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.840
 the truth is needed in the game without understanding 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.460
 why didn't the developers do it themselves 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.470
 With this mod you can remove 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.690
 camera at almost any distance 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.570
 You can usually only postpone the camera. 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.430
 so with the same mod you can give 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:44.050
 camera at a very long distance 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.570
 this mod is useful because using it 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.210
 you can see what to jump 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.120
 what happens behind the obstacles mountain 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.639
 or buildings another interesting mod 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.770
 which removes any sniper mode 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.720
 using wheel spin 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.700
 first sniper just as important to me to be 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.070
 go only 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.710
 pressing the shift button and it is strong 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.250
 fun when you just want some 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.220
 closer 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.220
 make go sniper lj 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.810
 next mod minimap 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.460
 with it you can see in 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.659
 first review of the tank, I do not know how 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.520
 it works well and also see the beam 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.520
 which shows where you look 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.180
 last from i can't show you 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.050
 because he just removes the screensaver 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.599
 chief when you start the game and you 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.469
 will no longer waste time for 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.440
 order to throw off this outpost as 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:47.379
 install mods when you download the archive there 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.449
 there will be two folders in one folder will be 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.479
 just fashion separately you can 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.030
 you can simply choose something 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.819
 copy the assembly then you will have everything 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.690
 mods that were videos for this we take 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:06.460
 select all and open the folder with the game 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.509
 I have this Putin computer disk c games 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.430
 and world of tanks 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:16.539
 and here we copy the folder and everything is necessary 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:23.349
 replace necessarily if you are old 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:27.159
 mods folder then it is better to delete everything 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:30.339
 is being replaced and now the mods should 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.440
 appear in the game but be sure to 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:34.960
 it worked normally a deer so that 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.110
 you showed the damage that you inflicted 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.110
 then you need to start the game run at all 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.719
 always play with this file 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.810
 xvm-stat 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:48.940
 press it and you and the game should 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.500
 here is such a black window 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.500
 the game appears and starts 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.469
 Thank you all for watching I hope these 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.240
 mods will be useful to you if some 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:06.029
 there will be questions ask them in 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.029
