00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.969
 Hi, welcome to the picture today, let's go. 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.020
 continue talking about excretory system 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.740
 the last class 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.590
 we have already seen the Phrygian protons 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.530
 antenna and glands more 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.770
 I want to show you today. 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:29.449
 two more writing structures to 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.720
 first of these are the graves of bad ig 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.739
 these structures are found in the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.050
 arthropods mainly in insects and 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.840
 also in which it will be given as per 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.870
 example in oranges already 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.610
 and will show what these 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.040
 good pipes 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.980
 mauppin tubes are actually bags 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.670
 elongated and well tubular these bags 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.760
 have a blind bottom on one side and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.270
 it means that it has no 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.330
 end here and on the other side they 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.140
 communicate with the gut 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.890
 so here in pink is the intestine 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.910
 this spider 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.360
 remembering that these animals already have a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.830
 management system and the complete 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.619
 here in the anus 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.280
 the Malpighian studies are in contact 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.700
 hemolymph and circulating here in the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 There are discrete hemolymph as per 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.750
 uric acid and if discrete are 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.440
 absorbed then we have everything bad 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.700
 click and they will be led to the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.520
 intestine 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.759
 these compounds are following here in the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.410
 digestive system until they are eliminated 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.800
 together with the stool so notice that 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 there is a communication between this 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.250
 excretory system formed by the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.959
 malpighi and the system of managers and here 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.140
 in the case of spiders 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:13.040
 I would also like to highlight the presence of 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.980
 kochai glands these bands are 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.960
 similar to the anterior glands 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.720
 that we saw in the last class 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.860
 only they stay here at the base of the legs 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.240
 of the spider 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.220
 these glands also absolve 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.430
 directly some of the discrete 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.280
 hemolymph and these discrete 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.810
 released into the environment 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.230
 so here are the glands the shas 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.770
 are found in some species of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.020
 spiders and note that in this case the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.440
 discrete spiders by studies of 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.240
 malpighi and also by the kochai glands 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.140
 at the same time 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.990
 and to close this year I'm going to talk about 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.950
 the last writer structure that are the 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.220
 kidneys 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.880
 the bad is that bean-shaped man 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.460
 which can be found in the chordates and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.150
 In the kidneys we find those 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.770
 excretory units that are called 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 nephrons involve a ball of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.910
 blood capillaries that are called 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.250
 Glomerulus products that should be 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.840
 excreta will arrive here through 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.110
 two campuses 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.320
 the enrollees will be withdrawn from the blood 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.800
 nephrons and driven by a 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.460
 system until the tubes 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.140
 where they will be eliminated along with the 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:51.260
 urine and then the kidneys get here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.480
 a number of substances and they do 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.740
 a filtering of what should be 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.880
 eliminated and driven by the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.090
 writer and what should be 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.450
 returned to the blood capillaries and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.610
 to other systems 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.700
 we ended up here with these two types 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.840
 structures and scriptures and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.410
 next classrooms 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.299
 Let's start talking about each edge. 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.880
 individually starting with the 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.880
 politicians do not miss until then
