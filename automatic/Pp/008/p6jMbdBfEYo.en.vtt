okay now I'm going to show you how I get
these<00:00:02.850> old<00:00:03.570> rubber<00:00:03.959> bushings<00:00:04.650> out<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
these old rubber bushings out of the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.909 
these old rubber bushings out of the
spring<00:00:05.730> guys<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.290> there's<00:00:07.290> really<00:00:07.410> only<00:00:07.529> two

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
spring guys here there's really only two

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.919 
spring guys here there's really only two
things<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.030> need<00:00:09.059> we've<00:00:09.420> got<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> drill

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
things that you need we've got to drill

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.820 
things that you need we've got to drill
with<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> drill<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.160> roughly<00:00:11.429> quarter<00:00:11.820> inch

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
with the drill bit roughly quarter inch

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.990 
with the drill bit roughly quarter inch
and<00:00:13.830> then<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.280> got<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> torch

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and then we got the torch

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.060 
and then we got the torch
I've<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.450> map<00:00:15.660> gas<00:00:15.900> propane<00:00:16.199> works<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.949> as

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
I've got map gas propane works just as

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.950 
I've got map gas propane works just as
well<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.330> trying<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> melt

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
well for this you're just trying to melt

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
well for this you're just trying to melt
it<00:00:19.170> really<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.490> I'm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it really and what I'm going to do I'm

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
it really and what I'm going to do I'm
going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> drill<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.810> series<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.830> holes

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
going to drill a series of holes

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.089 
going to drill a series of holes
probably<00:00:23.490> five<00:00:23.640> or<00:00:23.820> six<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.510> rubber<00:00:25.410> all

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
probably five or six in the rubber all

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220 
probably five or six in the rubber all
the<00:00:26.550> way<00:00:26.670> through<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.660> then<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the way through and then we're going to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
the way through and then we're going to
heat<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.680> primarily<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
heat it up primarily what we want to do

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.049 
heat it up primarily what we want to do
is<00:00:30.179> heat<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.630> inner<00:00:30.869> seal<00:00:31.730> sleeve<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is heat up this inner seal sleeve and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.950 
is heat up this inner seal sleeve and
that<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.899> help<00:00:35.030> sort<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> melt<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.719> rubber

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that will help sort of melt the rubber

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
that will help sort of melt the rubber
and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> hammer<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.610> it'll

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and then we can hammer it out and it'll

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
and then we can hammer it out and it'll
just<00:00:39.540> fall<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> bottom<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:41.340> go

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
just fall out the bottom so let's go

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.010 
just fall out the bottom so let's go
ahead<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:41.940> started<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:47.570> can<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.719> tricky

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
ahead and get started here can be tricky

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:30.700 
ahead and get started here can be tricky
to<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> started<00:00:49.680> sometime

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.040 

there<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.800> go<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.760> out<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.940> there<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
there we go got it all out of there the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.270 
there we go got it all out of there the
next<00:01:34.260> thing<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> need<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.040> our<00:01:35.160> new

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
next thing we need to do to get our new

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
next thing we need to do to get our new
polyurethane<00:01:35.970> bushings<00:01:36.330> installed<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.870> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
polyurethane bushings installed is this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.120 
polyurethane bushings installed is this
large<00:01:37.860> diameter<00:01:38.370> sleeve<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.130> needs

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
large diameter sleeve right here needs

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
large diameter sleeve right here needs
to<00:01:41.220> come<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.700> well<00:01:41.730> now<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.510> just<00:01:42.600> found

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
to come out as well now I just found

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.650 
to come out as well now I just found
that<00:01:43.440> my<00:01:43.620> sawzall<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.480> broken<00:01:45.480> it<00:01:45.570> doesn't

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
that my sawzall is broken it doesn't

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.500 
that my sawzall is broken it doesn't
work<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.920> best<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> steel

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
work so the best way to get this steel

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.980 
work so the best way to get this steel
sleeve<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.040> cut<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
sleeve out of here is to actually cut it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.090 
sleeve out of here is to actually cut it
just<00:01:51.990> straight<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.440> center<00:01:52.560> try<00:01:52.830> not<00:01:52.980> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
just straight down the center try not to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.890 
just straight down the center try not to
cut<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> spring<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.180> might<00:01:54.330> make<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
cut into the spring you might make it a

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.300 
cut into the spring you might make it a
little<00:01:55.050> bit<00:01:55.230> but<00:01:55.410> that's<00:01:55.500> okay<00:01:55.650> try<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
little bit but that's okay try not to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
little bit but that's okay try not to
cut<00:01:56.490> too<00:01:56.730> deep<00:01:57.000> into<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.780> spring<00:01:58.080> eye<00:01:58.200> itself

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
cut too deep into the spring eye itself

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.450 
cut too deep into the spring eye itself
I'm<00:01:59.250> using<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.670> air<00:01:59.850> body<00:02:00.090> saw<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.130> result

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I'm using my air body saw it the result

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.530 
I'm using my air body saw it the result
would<00:02:02.580> be<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.760> same<00:02:02.940> it'll<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.390> take<00:02:03.480> me

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
would be the same it'll just take me

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
would be the same it'll just take me
longer<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:04.050> do<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.260> with<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.680> we're<00:02:04.770> going

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
longer to do it with this so we're going

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.600 
longer to do it with this so we're going
to<00:02:04.920> make<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.280> cut<00:02:05.960> through<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.050> center<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
to make one cut through the center just

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
to make one cut through the center just
to<00:02:08.610> split<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.119> sleeve<00:02:09.630> in<00:02:09.840> half<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.500> then

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
to split the sleeve in half and then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410 
to split the sleeve in half and then
we'll<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.070> some<00:02:11.460> screwdrivers<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.300> some

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
we'll get some screwdrivers and some

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:26.149 
we'll get some screwdrivers and some
chisels<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> we'll<00:02:13.470> punch<00:02:13.740> out<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.400> sleeve

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.920 

all<00:02:27.159> right<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> got<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> cut<00:02:27.970> all<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.840> way

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
all right so I got a cut all the way

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.869 
all right so I got a cut all the way
through<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:31.299> bushing<00:02:31.690> here<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.310> I'm<00:02:33.790> just

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
through the bushing here so I'm just

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.789 
through the bushing here so I'm just
using<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.299> screwdriver<00:02:34.540> yes<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
using a screwdriver yes I know a

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.979 
using a screwdriver yes I know a
screwdriver<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.459> not<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.610> chisel<00:02:37.030> however<00:02:37.810> it

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
screwdriver is not a chisel however it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.630 
screwdriver is not a chisel however it
can<00:02:38.170> be<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:39.129> how<00:02:39.340> I'm<00:02:39.400> going<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.579> use

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
can be and that's how I'm going to use

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.509 
can be and that's how I'm going to use
it<00:02:39.879> today<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.989> we'll<00:02:41.110> just<00:02:41.290> start<00:02:41.440> tapping

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.170 

straight<00:02:45.519> down<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.879> cut<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.879> there<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.120> can

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
straight down the cut so there you can

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.720 
straight down the cut so there you can
see<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.750> sleeve<00:02:53.049> is<00:02:53.260> split<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.609> way

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
see that sleeve is split all the way

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.940 
see that sleeve is split all the way
down<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> center<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.629> now<00:02:55.660> we<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:56.079> just<00:02:56.709> drive

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
down the center so now we can just drive

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:12.820 
down the center so now we can just drive
it<00:02:57.099> out<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.310> there<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.160 

there's<00:03:13.400> our<00:03:13.550> sleeve<00:03:13.850> now<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:14.900> need<00:03:15.110> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
there's our sleeve now I just need to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.800 
there's our sleeve now I just need to
clean<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.560> out<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:15.920> there<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.340> then<00:03:17.270> shove

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
clean this out in there and then shove

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.030 
clean this out in there and then shove
our<00:03:17.900> new<00:03:18.020> polyurethane<00:03:18.590> bushings<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.010> place

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
our new polyurethane bushings in place

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.320 
our new polyurethane bushings in place
okay<00:03:22.040> now<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.400> have<00:03:22.460> this<00:03:22.610> sleeve

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
okay now that we have this sleeve

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.610 
okay now that we have this sleeve
punched<00:03:23.690> out<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> spring<00:03:24.170> I'd<00:03:24.290> there's<00:03:24.500> some

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
punched out the spring I'd there's some

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.770 
punched out the spring I'd there's some
rust<00:03:24.800> in<00:03:24.980> there<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.310> need<00:03:25.460> to<00:03:25.600> scrub<00:03:26.600> out

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
rust in there that we need to scrub out

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.850 
rust in there that we need to scrub out
of<00:03:26.930> there<00:03:27.050> there's<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.320> couple<00:03:27.530> ways<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.770> can

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
of there there's a couple ways you can

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.650 
of there there's a couple ways you can
do<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.220> could<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.430> take<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.970> regular<00:03:29.450> old

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
do it you could just take a regular old

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.480 
do it you could just take a regular old
brush<00:03:30.110> stick<00:03:30.710> it<00:03:30.830> down<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:30.980> there<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.370> get

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
brush stick it down in there and get

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.150 
brush stick it down in there and get
some<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.060> out<00:03:32.270> of<00:03:32.300> there<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:33.410> little<00:03:33.980> bit

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
some of that out of there a little bit

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.010 
some of that out of there a little bit
better<00:03:34.340> option<00:03:34.790> would<00:03:34.820> be<00:03:34.940> taking<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.390> little

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
better option would be taking a little

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.480 
better option would be taking a little
wire<00:03:36.260> brush<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.800> can<00:03:36.830> check<00:03:37.130> up<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.400> your

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
wire brush that you can check up in your

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.970 
wire brush that you can check up in your
drill<00:03:37.760> spin<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.630> around<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:39.080> there<00:03:39.260> what<00:03:39.830> I'm

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
drill spin that around in there what I'm

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.150 
drill spin that around in there what I'm
actually<00:03:40.190> going<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.520> use<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.140> small<00:03:42.590> little

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
actually going to use is a small little

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280 
actually going to use is a small little
hone<00:03:43.520> now<00:03:43.760> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.060> really<00:03:44.240> like<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.690> wheel

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
hone now this is really like a wheel

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.770 
hone now this is really like a wheel
cylinder<00:03:45.740> hone<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.220> I've<00:03:46.970> got<00:03:47.120> some<00:03:47.240> wd-40

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
cylinder hone and I've got some wd-40

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.100 
cylinder hone and I've got some wd-40
I'm<00:03:48.020> going<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.200> stick<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.680> hole<00:03:50.110> to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
I'm going to stick this in the hole to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.140 
I'm going to stick this in the hole to
kind<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:52.010> rust<00:03:52.460> scale<00:03:52.700> out<00:03:52.910> of<00:03:53.030> there

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
kind of get that rust scale out of there

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.390 
kind of get that rust scale out of there
now<00:03:53.360> because<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.710> way<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.920> spring<00:03:55.250> is

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
now because of the way the spring is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.770 
now because of the way the spring is
wrapped<00:03:55.790> here<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.090> need<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.330> make<00:03:56.480> sure<00:03:56.510> that

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
wrapped here you need to make sure that

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.990 
wrapped here you need to make sure that
you<00:03:56.900> spin<00:03:57.230> this<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.220> correct<00:03:58.460> direction

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
you spin this in the correct direction

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.150 
you spin this in the correct direction
in<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.570> case<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.290> drill<00:04:00.560> would<00:04:00.710> be<00:04:00.800> going<00:04:01.070> in

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
in this case the drill would be going in

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.390 
in this case the drill would be going in
Reverse<00:04:01.490> like<00:04:01.940> that<00:04:02.240> if<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.050> spin<00:04:03.320> it<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:04.220> that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
Reverse like that if you spin it in that

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.220 
Reverse like that if you spin it in that
direction<00:04:04.580> it's<00:04:05.420> going<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.660> catch<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.110> that

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
direction it's going to catch on that

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.250 
direction it's going to catch on that
little<00:04:06.880> notch<00:04:07.880> right<00:04:07.910> there<00:04:08.270> and<00:04:08.780> you'll

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
little notch right there and you'll

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:26.460 
little notch right there and you'll
you'll<00:04:09.920> break<00:04:10.070> your<00:04:10.280> little<00:04:10.430> home

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.110 

so<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.740> clean<00:04:27.949> enough<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.490> smooth

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
so this is clean enough and smooth

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.670 
so this is clean enough and smooth
enough<00:04:29.330> for<00:04:29.540> our<00:04:29.630> purposes<00:04:30.080> if<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.410> are<00:04:30.530> going

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
enough for our purposes if you are going

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.900 
enough for our purposes if you are going
to<00:04:30.770> use<00:04:30.860> one<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.130> these<00:04:31.220> small<00:04:31.400> little<00:04:31.760> wheel

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
to use one of these small little wheel

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.330 
to use one of these small little wheel
cylinder<00:04:32.300> homes<00:04:32.479> just<00:04:33.199> remember<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:34.160> just

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
cylinder homes just remember you just

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.890 
cylinder homes just remember you just
want<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.639> enough<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.060> take<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.690> rust

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
want to do it enough to take the rust

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.050 
want to do it enough to take the rust
and<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.410> scale<00:04:36.740> out<00:04:37.190> from<00:04:37.460> inside<00:04:37.760> there<00:04:37.970> if

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
and the scale out from inside there if

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.430 
and the scale out from inside there if
you<00:04:38.150> do<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.419> too<00:04:38.540> long<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.900> will<00:04:39.080> increase

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
you do this too long you will increase

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.439 
you do this too long you will increase
the<00:04:39.560> size<00:04:39.889> of<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.639> hole<00:04:40.850> right<00:04:40.910> here<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.360> you

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
the size of this hole right here and you

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.180 
the size of this hole right here and you
don't<00:04:41.479> want<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.810> do<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.620> bushings<00:04:43.010> are

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
don't want to do that the bushings are

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.800 
don't want to do that the bushings are
there<00:04:43.729> not<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.880> press<00:04:44.180> fit<00:04:44.389> but<00:04:44.570> they<00:04:44.660> are<00:04:44.780> a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
there not a press fit but they are a

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.640 
there not a press fit but they are a
snug<00:04:45.199> fit

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
snug fit

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.610 
snug fit
so<00:04:46.010> don't<00:04:46.550> spin<00:04:46.970> this<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:47.570> too<00:04:47.720> long<00:04:47.900> or<00:04:48.320> you

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
so don't spin this for too long or you

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370 
so don't spin this for too long or you
will<00:04:48.830> increase<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> size<00:04:49.699> of<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:49.910> hole<00:04:50.380> now

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
will increase the size of that hole now
