things they were selling last night was
this<00:01:18.930> idea<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.320> instead<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> cover<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
this idea of instead of a cover that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
this idea of instead of a cover that
just<00:01:21.030> covers<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.900> cover<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
just covers it the cover is actually a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
just covers it the cover is actually a
keyboard<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.670> you've<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> full

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
keyboard as well so you've got a full

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
keyboard as well so you've got a full
sort<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> computing<00:01:25.590> experience<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
sort of computing experience that is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
sort of computing experience that is
perhaps<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:27.960> than<00:01:28.439> you'd<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.770> if

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
perhaps a bit more than you'd get if

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.499 
perhaps a bit more than you'd get if
you're<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.520> using<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> surf<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.450> the
