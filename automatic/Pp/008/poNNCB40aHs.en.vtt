00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
 Welcome to Andrew welcome lovers 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:07.019
 today I bring you a new video in which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
 I'm going to present three applications one 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.139
 rather three games that are super 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 interactive and which are going to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.730
 cause a somewhat awesome addiction and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 incredible this is due to three factors 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.170
 the level of minimalism and graphics the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.510
 which will produce a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.090
 satisfaction at the time of playing no longer 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 that in no time you are disappointed 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.840
 second by the level of difficulty of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 that is so complicated that your friends 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.719
 here will tell you more so you can 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.399
 try to improve your break for your last 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.739
 position score and therefore you're going 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 to be addicted and as the last one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.589
 the elect me and therefore I suppose 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.780
 that if I have been hooked 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.239
 so much self I suppose that also and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.829
 these reasons I suppose you are going to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.239
 hook as much as me in the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.190
 moments when you do not have anything that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.659
 do as you are waiting will be a very 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 good option which to take for 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.920
 entertain us during that short period 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.999
 of time so let's go to immediacy 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.999
 with these three games 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.880
 to start this top 3 games we're going to 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.250
 start talking about daily long is a 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.079
 game which is basically dedicated 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.359
 to learn to walk through a 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.340
 little monster this little monster can 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.990
 differentiate by getting to get a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.259
 scores series to get 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 get up to a few meters and once 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.200
 arrived at those meters we will get a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.079
 series of prizes which will be 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.259
 exchangeable for accessories like in this 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.780
 case it can be a hat or if we are already going 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.179
 improving and we're pretty good and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.799
 we get great meters we can 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.750
 also unlock this new character 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.489
 which is something larger something more extensive 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.009
 and therefore more complicated to 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:57.200
 use and we can decorate them 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.539
 putting them t-shirts pants and everything 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.549
 what we can get to get 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.640
 also it is possible to say that the game is super 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.619
 complicated at the control level and that for 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.440
 move only a few meters 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.690
 it is necessary to have absolute control 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 on the knees the legs that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.280
 it hurt before it hurt afterwards and so 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 so much is something more uncomfortable and difficult to 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.069
 use 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 with regards to the second game 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.770
 This is a very simple game 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.590
 explain but that your addiction is 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.420
 tremendous since it is only constituted 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.810
 for having a block and has to be able to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.959
 earn it within the boundaries of the building 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.560
 which we want to build without eliminating 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.060
 great piece of which we have and have 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.489
 this means that if we click on the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.900
 screen right in the center with the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.220
 blocks is located in the center we will go 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.200
 building our tower little by little 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.360
 The higher score we get 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 bigger coins we will get and we can 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.610
 besides this get bonuses 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 for our construction of the tower at 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 redeem these coins earned by 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.330
 more this is done by simply clicking 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.640
 a lot and elevating our our 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.840
 building to the highest possible height 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.299
 It should also be noted that if we get 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280
 lot of points of the coin 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.530
 we can exchange for new buildings and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.590
 be like for example a lighthouse or a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.000
 building in the city and as last 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.860
 game that he has used for his great 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.540
 addiction is one more line is a game 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 which basically it can be governed 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.799
 norms which is to get the maximum 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.720
 possible score traveling the maximum 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.850
 Possible space and meters 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.590
 t without actually colliding with hundreds 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.160
 of circumferences or with limits 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.630
 marked by blue parallel lines 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.160
 once we have done this we will have 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.440
 that hook us a lot to 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.610
 get the highest score and the 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.080
 operation is very simple as 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.880
 you are seeing the unit that has what 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.440
 only thing we have to do is go towards 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.450
 up as much as we can continue 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 with the tour without touching us and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.770
 clicking on the screen whenever we want 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.390
 make a radio with according to which center 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.860
 of circumference 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.020
 this is the basic operation and the 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.730
 addiction is going to be huge and as I said 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.920
 at the beginning it will be very useful 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.200
 for those moments when you do not have 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.580
 nothing to do or you are waiting and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.560
 good until here come the end of 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.180
 video if you liked it I love that I 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.890
 you leave a line and you leave me the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.420
 comments that you think this 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.250
 new photography that I study taking in 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.540
 the channel either thanks to my new 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.180
 camera and the new blueprints that I'm 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.590
 offering therefore without further delay 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.359
 I would love guests to have their 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.190
 channels and that you follow me in my account 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.380
 instagram since as has been reiterated 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.910
 some that other times I'm a great 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.200
 amateur photographer and my jacket 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.260
 and let me leave your opinion on 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.840
 the photographs that instagram took 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.030
 a breakfast of an animal are something more 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.160
 cured and that in my opinion they have 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.320
 something of quality are not the typical photos 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.570
 of instagram besides all this for 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.400
 end the spam time I fit in 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.710
 the channel abc a youtube account a 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.700
 new account with a channel called 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.260
 schultz sanzar 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.330
 which is a project that I am 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.430
 doing in 2015 and if you want 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.830

 shortly I will make a video in which 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.460
 reflect this even greater spam by offering 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.490
 a short short of the video that I will upload 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 inside nothing and good now without more 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.060
