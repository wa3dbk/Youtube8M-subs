still very early days we still got a
verse<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.699> top<00:00:54.530> whatever<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.039> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
it's realistically it's pretty realistic

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.790 
it's realistically it's pretty realistic
because<00:04:33.389> we<00:04:33.600> had<00:04:33.720> all<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.960> easier<00:04:34.320> fixtures

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.990 
in the first week so it might look I'm
realistic<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.759> it<00:04:38.850> really<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:41.550> we're

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
realistic but it really is so we're

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.629
