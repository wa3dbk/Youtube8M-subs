00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.119
 very good days evenings very good nights 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.100
 have all of you welcome once 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.080
 more today I will teach how to do 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.419
 other Christmas spheres that are very 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.949
 parents and very colorful and surely 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.660
 are going to see great in your tree 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.210
 Christmas if some of you are 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.650
 they ask your type of videos a lot 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.810
 before with a lot of anticipation 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.490
 so that you also have time 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.770
 enough to be able to do those 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.750
 crafts and these ideas that I give them 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.850
 I'm sharing from the week 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.770
 last and until the month of January the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.870
 Most of my videos are going to give topics 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.120
 Christmas the idea is in this time 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.010
 share content as varied as 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.670
 can be crafts ornaments 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.040
 decorative gifts recipes 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.260
 desserts blogs even up to one another 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.480
 stage all this is to enrich the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.520
 content of this channel and grab that 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.430
 I'm already planning what the design will be 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.860
 of this channel for next year 2015 and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.600
 if everything goes well, great things come 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.230
 that can not be lost but good 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.940
 getting back 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.920
 Today I want to show you how to make some 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.260
 Christmas waits that are very nice 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 these spheres were made by my mom and one 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.640
 of my days several years ago and good me 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.410
 since last year I want to share them 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.630
 you are dealing with these areas 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.060
 Christmas decorations made with sequin fabric 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.650
 This type of fabric is very common and 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.480
 it's better that it's not expensive 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.970
 Stay with me and this great chequen 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.120
 idea or else you electivas your moms to 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.440
 your grandmothers to friends and so on 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.990
 You can all these materials 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.510
 find where they sell fabrics with stores 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.180
 haberdashery balls of unicel thread 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.520
 resistant golden or silver thread for 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.280
 Hang the spheres laths of several 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 colors spangle nes boys of several 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.800
 sequins fabric colors this is very 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.690
 common and it does not cost very expensive first 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.760
 what we have to do is wrap 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.520
 our unicel ball on the fabric like 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.770
 if it was a candy for this 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.900
 we need to cut a square of cloth 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.230
 large enough to cover all 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.230
 the sphere 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.069
 with a resistant nest we are going to knot the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.069
 fabric to maintain the shape 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.420
 select the colors and drill each 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 spangle that you are going to use 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.310
 insert a piece of ribbon into the 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.319
 hole in your sequin and stick it on 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.319
 knot of your sphere creating a loop 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.500
 repeat this same procedure by pasting 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.500
 several arms around the knot 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.660
 finally add a thread of yarn 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.990
 resistant or lath to hang the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.990
 sphere 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.060
 this other is a variant of the first 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.930
 short sphere two strips of cloth one more 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.930
 big that the other 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.739
 with the most bound strip covers the part 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.840
 center of the sphere does not matter if 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.239
 the sides remain uncovered 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.049
 if you notice, I put this first strip on 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.790
 reverse ie hiding the sequins 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.129
 in this way two fabrics will appear 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.400
 different but if you like you can 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.530
 make them with the shiny side 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 with the second strip that is thicker 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.450
 makes a knot in the central part 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.540
 stick your sphere with silicon right in the 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.700
 knot and with each end of the strip 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.860
 leftover covers the rest of the sphere 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.040
 as if it were a candy just like 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.360
 we did it with the first sphere 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.360
 greet well so I do not know 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.530
 and ready for everything, you are not great 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.690
 you can leave here and do the 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.380
 designs that you like the colors 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.380

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.999

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.830

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.720

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.580
