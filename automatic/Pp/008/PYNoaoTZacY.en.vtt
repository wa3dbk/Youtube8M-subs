00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
connection number three legs now you

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
connection number three legs now you
will<00:00:49.500> find<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.039> last<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.570> towards<00:00:52.020> C

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
will find the last one the one towards C

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.549 
will find the last one the one towards C
that's<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.879> difficult<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.930> you'll

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that's all it is a difficult one you'll

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.020 
that's all it is a difficult one you'll
see<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> minute<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.460> won't<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> able<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
see in a minute I won't be able to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
see in a minute I won't be able to
remove<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.840> still<00:00:58.140> there<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.920> hot

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
remove it it's still there if it's hot

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.330 
remove it it's still there if it's hot
now<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.570> order<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.050> aid<00:01:01.320> remove<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
now in order to aid remove I'm going to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
now in order to aid remove I'm going to
use<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> liquid<00:01:03.329> solder<00:01:03.750> on

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
use a little bit of liquid solder on

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.420 
use a little bit of liquid solder on
this<00:01:04.790> as<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.840> moving<00:01:07.280> it's<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
this as you can see is not moving it's a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.149 
this as you can see is not moving it's a
very<00:01:08.670> difficult<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.390> obviously<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.979> got

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
very difficult one obviously is it's got

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.120 
very difficult one obviously is it's got
quite<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.930> metal<00:01:12.930> behind<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
quite a lot of metal behind it so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.179 
quite a lot of metal behind it so
putting<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> solder<00:01:16.189> liquid

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
putting on a little bit of solder liquid

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.080 
putting on a little bit of solder liquid
solder<00:01:18.470> will<00:01:19.470> actually<00:01:19.860> aid<00:01:20.130> getting<00:01:20.790> heat

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
solder will actually aid getting heat

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
solder will actually aid getting heat
through<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.080> remove<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.619> now<00:01:22.830> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
through to it to remove it now I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
through to it to remove it now I'm
cleaning<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> board<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.060> some

video you'll notice that the it was a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
video you'll notice that the it was a
different<00:02:03.689> color<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> had<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> white<00:02:04.530> latch

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.460 
little bit of liquid solder just to tack
down<00:02:18.720> two<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.990> pins<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:21.520> hold<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.150> place

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
down two of the pins to hold it in place

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.960 
down two of the pins to hold it in place
then<00:02:23.470> what<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:23.950> I'm<00:02:24.069> going<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.550> is<00:02:24.670> supply

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
then what what I'm going to do is supply

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.030 
then what what I'm going to do is supply
some<00:02:25.330> more<00:02:25.569> liquid<00:02:25.959> solder<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.650> I've<00:02:26.830> done

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
some more liquid solder which I've done

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.810 
some more liquid solder which I've done
there<00:02:27.310> over<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.810> rest<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.470> pins

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
there over to the the rest of the pins

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.340 
there over to the the rest of the pins
now<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.540> roughly<00:02:32.080> six<00:02:33.010> pins<00:02:33.310> each<00:02:33.610> side

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
now this this roughly six pins each side

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.130 
now this this roughly six pins each side
and<00:02:35.350> you'll<00:02:35.530> need<00:02:35.770> extra<00:02:36.310> heat<00:02:36.520> only<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.600> one

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and you'll need extra heat only the one

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.640 
and you'll need extra heat only the one
furthest<00:02:38.860> away<00:02:39.040> from<00:02:39.640> from<00:02:40.270> from<00:02:40.600> my<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.500> I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
furthest away from from from my so I'm

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.380 
furthest away from from from my so I'm
just<00:02:41.890> gonna<00:02:42.040> touch<00:02:42.310> him<00:02:42.580> back<00:02:42.790> over<00:02:43.030> again

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
just gonna touch him back over again

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.350 
just gonna touch him back over again
I've<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.569> applied<00:02:44.290> some<00:02:44.319> liquid<00:02:44.920> solder

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
I've just applied some liquid solder

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.320 
I've just applied some liquid solder
touch<00:02:46.360> each<00:02:46.600> one<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:48.370> there's<00:02:48.670> any<00:02:48.850> bridging

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
touch each one if there's any bridging

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.750 
touch each one if there's any bridging
now<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.600> should<00:02:49.900> remove<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.430> there<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.730> have

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
now it should remove and there you have

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.110 
now it should remove and there you have
it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.120 
it
that's<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:53.260> good<00:02:54.690> connection<00:02:55.769> okay<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.830> might

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
that's a good connection okay you might

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.400 
that's a good connection okay you might
notice<00:02:57.580> it's<00:02:57.820> not<00:02:57.880> entirely<00:02:58.510> square<00:02:59.050> on<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
notice it's not entirely square on the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.890 
notice it's not entirely square on the
board<00:02:59.590> but<00:02:59.920> doesn't<00:03:00.670> matter<00:03:00.850> as<00:03:01.570> long<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.750> we

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
board but doesn't matter as long as we

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.949 
board but doesn't matter as long as we
haven't<00:03:02.200> got<00:03:02.410> any<00:03:02.590> bridging<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.730> fine<00:03:04.060> okay

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
haven't got any bridging it's fine okay

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.960 
haven't got any bridging it's fine okay
so<00:03:05.019> what<00:03:05.290> I'm<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.890> smear<00:03:06.640> some

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
so what I'm gonna do is smear some

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.540 
so what I'm gonna do is smear some
liquid<00:03:07.330> solder<00:03:07.570> across<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.410> remaining<00:03:09.190> six

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
liquid solder across the remaining six

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.259 
liquid solder across the remaining six
on<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.090> other<00:03:10.209> side<00:03:12.060> okay

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
on the other side okay

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.020 
on the other side okay
now<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.019> stuff<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.470> got<00:03:14.800> miniature<00:03:15.459> solder

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
now this stuff is got miniature solder

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.170 
now this stuff is got miniature solder
balls<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:16.600> suspension<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:18.190> solder<00:03:18.579> flux

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
balls in suspension in a solder flux

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.259 
balls in suspension in a solder flux
it's<00:03:19.660> brilliant<00:03:20.700> you'll<00:03:21.700> see<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.150> minute

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
it's brilliant you'll see in a minute

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.539 
it's brilliant you'll see in a minute
the<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:23.079> know<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> apply<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.769> solder<00:03:24.160> iron

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
the you know you apply the solder iron

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.819 
the you know you apply the solder iron
around<00:03:25.510> about<00:03:25.690> 350<00:03:26.410> degrees<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:29.350> solder

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
around about 350 degrees and that solder

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.680 
around about 350 degrees and that solder
will<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.190> flow<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.489> where<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.120> needs<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.480> flow

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
will just flow to where it needs to flow

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.970 
will just flow to where it needs to flow
you<00:03:32.320> know<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.690> don't<00:03:34.690> be<00:03:34.840> tempted<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.350> use<00:03:35.500> too

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you know so don't be tempted to use too

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.610 
you know so don't be tempted to use too
much<00:03:36.250> solder<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:37.720> let's<00:03:38.320> get<00:03:38.500> this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
much solder on this let's get this

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.100 
much solder on this let's get this
interview<00:03:38.980> for<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.570> okay<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.630> don't<00:03:40.870> need<00:03:41.019> to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
interview for you okay you don't need to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.440 
interview for you okay you don't need to
put<00:03:41.290> any<00:03:41.440> pressure<00:03:41.799> on<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.910> gently<00:03:43.209> go

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
put any pressure on just gently go

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.069 
put any pressure on just gently go
across<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.519> can<00:03:45.820> see<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.660> there's<00:03:46.900> any

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
across as you can see if there's any

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.190 
across as you can see if there's any
bridging<00:03:47.560> there<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.280> see<00:03:48.489> we<00:03:48.549> remove<00:03:48.880> it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
bridging there you can see we remove it

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.509 
bridging there you can see we remove it
with<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> little<00:03:50.410> bit<00:03:50.560> more<00:03:50.709> sort<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.100> flip<00:03:51.310> so

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
with a little bit more sort of flip so

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.979 
with a little bit more sort of flip so
you<00:03:51.579> can<00:03:51.760> see<00:03:51.940> I've<00:03:52.030> got<00:03:52.180> some<00:03:52.390> bridging<00:03:52.780> there

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
you can see I've got some bridging there

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.020 
you can see I've got some bridging there
I'll<00:03:53.260> remove<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.250> there<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:54.880> are

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
I'll remove that there we are

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.270 
I'll remove that there we are
I've<00:03:55.239> removed<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.870> I'm<00:03:56.410> sorry<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.799> didn't<00:03:57.130> show
