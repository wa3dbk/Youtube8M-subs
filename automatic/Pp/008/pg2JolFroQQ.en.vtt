from here it's fallen out this is one of
these<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.720> pieces<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.410> needs<00:03:04.560> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
these little pieces it just needs a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.949 
these little pieces it just needs a
better<00:03:04.740> glue<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> hold<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.459> back<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.820> but<00:03:06.810> I'm

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
better glue to hold it back in but I'm

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.050 
better glue to hold it back in but I'm
very<00:03:07.200> easy<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.739> lose<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.580> careful<00:03:08.910> whatever

of pushing Nessa back now you can rock
this<00:03:26.519> back<00:03:26.820> into<00:03:27.090> an<00:03:27.300> l-shape<00:03:27.450> like<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.670> push

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
this back into an l-shape like so push

camera it's really hard to get this to
go<00:03:37.440> back<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.950> no<00:03:38.370> that's<00:03:38.730> whopping<00:03:39.260> fine<00:03:40.260> now

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
go back in no that's whopping fine now
