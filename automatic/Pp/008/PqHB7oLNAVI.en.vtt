interesting<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.400> called<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.820> new

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
interesting that they called it the new

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.020 
interesting that they called it the new
iphone<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.710> maybe<00:02:41.190> that's<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.970> they

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
iphone which on maybe that's what they

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.430 
iphone which on maybe that's what they
thought<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> would<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.870> called<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.320> it's

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
