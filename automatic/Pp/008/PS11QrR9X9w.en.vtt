does come off just like the
refer<00:04:26.009> to<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> guess<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:28.099> incase<00:04:29.099> slider<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:30.180> is

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
refer to I guess the incase slider it is

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
these before but everything is very

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.749 
these before but everything is very
clean<00:05:12.659> in<00:05:12.960> here<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:14.099> course<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.460> have<00:05:14.580> all

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
clean in here and of course you have all

your<00:05:14.880> standard<00:05:15.449> openings<00:05:15.900> on<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.199> which

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
your standard openings on that which

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.050 
your standard openings on that which
will<00:05:16.590> go<00:05:16.740> through<00:05:17.069> but<00:05:17.669> what<00:05:17.819> i<00:05:17.849> like<00:05:18.030> about

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.760 
will go through but what i like about
this<00:05:18.449> is<00:05:18.509> because<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.289> little<00:05:19.500> railing

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
this is because of that little railing

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.670 
this is because of that little railing
down<00:05:20.130> there<00:05:20.630> my<00:05:21.630> buttons<00:05:21.960> don't<00:05:22.199> hit<00:05:22.319> the<00:05:22.440> side

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
down there my buttons don't hit the side

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.719 
down there my buttons don't hit the side
and<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:24.750> slides<00:05:25.080> right<00:05:25.229> in<00:05:25.500> now<00:05:26.099> of<00:05:26.250> course<00:05:26.280> one

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
and it slides right in now of course one

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.760 
and it slides right in now of course one
thing<00:05:26.940> you<00:05:27.030> do<00:05:27.150> notice<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.629> your<00:05:27.870> back<00:05:28.080> logo<00:05:28.560> is

looking at it here I see that as a

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.779 
looking at it here I see that as a
little<00:05:39.090> bit<00:05:39.210> scratched<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:39.870> my<00:05:40.460> mirror<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.639> let

from<00:05:45.779> cleaning<00:05:46.110> it<00:05:46.409> just<00:05:46.680> scratching<00:05:47.069> it<00:05:47.130> up<00:05:47.219> I

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
from cleaning it just scratching it up I

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.879 
from cleaning it just scratching it up I
don't<00:05:47.460> know<00:05:47.870> regardless<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:49.110> line<00:05:49.529> your<00:05:49.560> case

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
don't know regardless you line your case

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.339 
don't know regardless you line your case
up<00:05:50.130> you<00:05:50.250> do<00:05:50.430> have<00:05:50.639> some<00:05:51.599> tabs<00:05:51.870> on<00:05:52.139> there<00:05:52.319> that

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
up you do have some tabs on there that

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.620 
up you do have some tabs on there that
do<00:05:52.650> go<00:05:52.830> underneath<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.580> then<00:05:53.610> you<00:05:54.270> have<00:05:54.449> the

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
do go underneath and then you have the

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.149 
do go underneath and then you have the
piece<00:05:54.840> in<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.110> center<00:05:55.409> that<00:05:55.440> actually<00:05:55.889> clicks

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
piece in the center that actually clicks

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.189 
piece in the center that actually clicks
into<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.520> back<00:05:56.729> a<00:05:56.969> little<00:05:57.479> different<00:05:57.870> design

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
into the back a little different design

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.999 
into the back a little different design
then<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:59.900> incase<00:06:00.900> slider<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.650> just<00:06:01.830> have<00:06:01.919> to

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
then the incase slider you just have to

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.159 
then the incase slider you just have to
make<00:06:02.159> sure<00:06:02.219> your<00:06:02.580> tabs<00:06:03.539> are<00:06:03.779> lined<00:06:03.990> up

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
make sure your tabs are lined up

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.809 
make sure your tabs are lined up
straight<00:06:04.409> as<00:06:05.069> you<00:06:05.940> do<00:06:06.150> that<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.740> then<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:08.580> can

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
straight as you do that and then you can

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.269 
straight as you do that and then you can
go<00:06:08.849> ahead<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.300> push<00:06:09.900> it<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.199> and<00:06:10.380> it<00:06:11.130> actually

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
go ahead and push it in and it actually

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.580 
go ahead and push it in and it actually
catches<00:06:11.849> the<00:06:11.969> back<00:06:12.150> there<00:06:12.419> just<00:06:12.840> ever<00:06:13.229> so

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
catches the back there just ever so

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.809 
catches the back there just ever so
slightly<00:06:13.620> and<00:06:14.840> holds<00:06:15.840> on<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.669> is

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
slightly and holds on so that is

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.050 
slightly and holds on so that is
actually<00:06:18.000> very<00:06:18.240> very<00:06:18.750> nice<00:06:19.580> full<00:06:20.580> protection

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
actually very very nice full protection

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.170 
actually very very nice full protection
on<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.659> front<00:06:21.900> of<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.110> phone<00:06:22.789> great<00:06:23.789> lay<00:06:24.029> on

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
on the front of the phone great lay on

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.570 
on the front of the phone great lay on
the<00:06:24.300> table<00:06:24.330> design<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.380> have<00:06:26.159> to<00:06:26.250> worry<00:06:26.430> about

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
the table design I have to worry about

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.339 
the table design I have to worry about
that<00:06:26.699> at<00:06:27.029> all<00:06:27.090> nice<00:06:27.389> a<00:06:27.419> nice<00:06:27.659> big<00:06:27.930> lip<00:06:28.169> on<00:06:28.319> that

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
that at all nice a nice big lip on that

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.649 
that at all nice a nice big lip on that
and<00:06:29.449> it's<00:06:30.449> very<00:06:31.219> form-fitting<00:06:32.270> just<00:06:33.270> like<00:06:33.509> the

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
and it's very form-fitting just like the

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.670 
and it's very form-fitting just like the
incase<00:06:34.050> slider<00:06:34.289> and<00:06:35.839> everything<00:06:36.839> is<00:06:37.020> lined<00:06:37.440> up

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
incase slider and everything is lined up

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.360 
incase slider and everything is lined up
Oh

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
Oh

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.760 
Oh
most<00:06:38.520> sits<00:06:38.940> a<00:06:39.060> little<00:06:39.210> bit<00:06:39.449> off<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:39.960> wonder<00:06:40.680> if

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
most sits a little bit off I wonder if

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.129 
most sits a little bit off I wonder if
that<00:06:40.979> would<00:06:41.190> really<00:06:41.490> be<00:06:41.639> affected<00:06:42.300> by<00:06:42.479> the

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.740 

lined<00:06:46.139> up<00:06:46.350> camera<00:06:46.770> hole<00:06:47.419> usually<00:06:48.419> it<00:06:48.540> doesn't

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
lined up camera hole usually it doesn't

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.129 
lined up camera hole usually it doesn't
but<00:06:49.139> let's<00:06:49.500> go<00:06:49.680> ahead<00:06:49.770> and<00:06:49.919> try<00:06:50.100> that<00:06:50.190> out<00:06:51.139> see

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
but let's go ahead and try that out see

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.469 
but let's go ahead and try that out see
what<00:06:52.260> we<00:06:52.350> got<00:06:52.560> here<00:06:55.550> nope<00:06:56.550> not<00:06:56.970> affected<00:06:57.419> at

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
what we got here nope not affected at

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.680 
what we got here nope not affected at
all<00:06:57.630> even<00:06:57.870> though<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.199> is<00:06:58.320> a<00:06:58.350> little<00:06:58.770> bit<00:06:59.010> off

00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.690 
all even though it is a little bit off

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.980 
all even though it is a little bit off
full<00:07:00.690> screen<00:07:01.050> is<00:07:01.199> in<00:07:01.229> there<00:07:01.590> no<00:07:01.949> problems<00:07:02.990> okay

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
full screen is in there no problems okay

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.350 
full screen is in there no problems okay
but<00:07:04.800> it<00:07:04.979> is<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.160> little<00:07:05.490> bit<00:07:05.610> off<00:07:05.699> unless<00:07:06.030> you

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
but it is a little bit off unless you

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.530 
but it is a little bit off unless you
know<00:07:07.290> I'm<00:07:08.190> gonna<00:07:08.460> have<00:07:08.639> this<00:07:08.760> on<00:07:09.030> right<00:07:09.240> here

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540

but you can see that is a little bit
shaky<00:07:12.780> on<00:07:12.930> that<00:07:13.139> but<00:07:13.320> it<00:07:13.440> does<00:07:13.590> not<00:07:13.710> affect<00:07:13.860> the

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430
