00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 and 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:48.330
 composition georgia details to consists of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.970
 several parts in this case i 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.180
 gathered you entry retreat 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.800
 consists of several parts which 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.640
 repeated several times the same 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.760
 the first hour that we played means it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760
 will be 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 the very first she repeats once somewhere 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.990
 In my opinion 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.290
 12 times here this piece I already have you 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.910
 showed in one to you and it means in one 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 from the video there I played on acoustic 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.780
 guitar well let's remember 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 on the aggressor with the help of such a cord 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.580
 This 5 insects and even the third finger 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.500
 fifth string on 2, 7 can so 5 string 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.390
 7 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.860
 forefinger we hold 4 strings 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 on the fifth fret here such that as yet 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.989
 once it is 5 to 7 and 4 to 5 right dark 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.210
 so hard to play 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.330
 6 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.810
 this 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.810
 four 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.520
 whole block 6 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.820
 i beach 4 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.820
 building 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.740
 3 4 behind the wheel on the sixth and fifth 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.280
 just leave the third finger 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.280
 on the seventh fret and so 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.180
 6 pieces 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.510
 further 6 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.510
 honey agaric 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:24.130
 page 5 on 7 4 on 5 6 pilot and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.180
 6 mint 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.819
 something 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.450
 further 6 6 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.489
 constantly first 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.489
 and 5 to 7 we have left 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.240
 leaf through 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.240
 I bring 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.770
 secret sea scope 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.770
 put on this 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.270
 hold and take everything look 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 means 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.720
 start 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.620
 5 to 7 many athletes 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.459
 we put 6 crystal fifth 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.459
 5 we sit and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.969
 such a piece will win past 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.119
 one 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.119
 but 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.930
 three times keys 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 so this is 1 part further we have the second 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.969
 part 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.640
 and we start with customers with open 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.840
 customer and forefinger push 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:20.600
 5 and 4 on the second fret immediately where the strings 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.600
 one finger 6 we will have it open 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.650
 no seats 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.310
 tenderness 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.770
 remaking 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:41.509
 1 GHz 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.509
 above certainly sundar 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.009
 once more, even in the summer and hit down 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.719
 they we did not have to 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.719
 further upper condition 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.339
 then we have wishes for this string 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.339
 with the second foot on the carrier 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.050
 pulls as from difficult on the table new 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.510
 sandwiched 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.990
 video 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.990
 . 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.810
 the most basic tune 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.400
 again say goodbye to the open queen on 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.400
 fifth string on 2 fret 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.440
 hit this time ducking 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.400
 while you see the solution 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:44.380
 Well, so obvious seven blows to go 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:49.270
 this is open due to 5 4 by 2 1 3 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.169
 clean with a trace under this string with 2 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.720
 fret carriers 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:58.870
 it's a stim from 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.870
 always slide here 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.370
 man quinta if water 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.870
 this helped signallers spacing 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.500
 and 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.270
 and 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.690
 reborne need opened a rib at the right 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.890
 steering wheel 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.890
 substitute yourself 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:04.050
 we have two parts of the entry with you 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.520
 if you liked the following videos i 

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.520
 I will definitely sort out the next part
