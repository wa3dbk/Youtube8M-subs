00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.590
 namaste I am short seen welcome back to 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.910
 game dev thaicom ok let's take a moment to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.260
 do a little I don't want to do 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 research but I wanted to show you a while 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.769
 couple of new topics and I like it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.119
 very much how you are putting yours 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 your creativity and yours 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 passion in writing comments 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.580
 so thank you very much keep on 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.040
 write comments 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.630
 and I took the first comment which is a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.739
 my comment just to give an example 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.629
 and I will make glory to air stoxx a prequel 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 what is papers please 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.350
 among other things, it will just come out of papers 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 place will also play those then 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.329
 let's realize we have gone 1 2 3 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.840
 4 5 6 7 weeks so I would say that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.180
 we can also build the new game 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 it will be a military military strategy 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.019
 platform will always be comfortable 64 e 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 let's give him the title glory to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:11.790
 hard stop to good that I always write it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.650
 well ok cost 30,000 we have 104,000 like 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.220
 then as a budget right now 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.010
 let's go ahead ok the 2d graphics and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 let's see what pops up 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.570
 meanwhile we have 11 we see immediately then 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 and so I'll explain it to you because maybe 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.310
 someone has not understood it while we have 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.710
 history is quite self-explanatory la 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.300
 history and the quests that is the things to be 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 do inside the game 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.620
 the gameplay is the way to play 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 the engine is the engine behind the 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 so I would say that we can also play 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.770
 so leave a very good story 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.400
 gameplay 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.840
 let's do a little we do so and so 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.869
 if we do so so because the gameplay 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220
 in a strategic perhaps even better 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.570
 let's do it so let's see what happens 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.490
 out of some point of technology e 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.259
 some design points that are coming 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.429
 in the meantime we are accumulating points of 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.480
 search 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.890
 the second part we have the dialogues 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.600
 artificial intelligence and level 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.220
 design then for considering that it is one 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.880
 strategic artificial intelligence will be 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.620
 maximum level design 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.750
 let's put it to a minimum and dialogues 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 let's put it in half 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.430
 in fact, halfway up the middle of the day 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.989
 then let's see what comes out of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.970
 this meanwhile prince of padua has come out 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.600
 on the market it sold 16,000 copies 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.120
 making a 114 thousand of gain then a 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.660
 good bit of money 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.760
 here we are at design set and technology 85 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.769
 right now the sound goes 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.640
 good graphics and low web design 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.600
 very high graphics e 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.670
 and put sound only we put it in half 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.050
 as well as see what comes out of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.920
 this glory to all art stock car 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.580
 I see that it is 11 11 12 13 13 9 we wait 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580
 let the bugs finish 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.470
 ok we have a 3 14 10 which is a good one 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.230
 score I have to say for starting 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.260
 have a new double new combo record 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.510
 so this is a good good combo too 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.570
 we know the military and strategic 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.380
 are good together we are earning a 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.660
 little experience 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.400
 more or less like last time 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.660
 we have something more than angie not 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.670
 you can see something more than 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.920
 more or less artificial intelligence 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.340
 we are pretty well placed we see of 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.640
 release the game let 's get there 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.470
 up to the summary page and then 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.060
 I finish the video already I want to do it a lot 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.660
 court and make a video game for each 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.420
 video and news from the industry this is 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.079
 very nice and that's what in many me 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.610
 you asked how it is what they are 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.790
 references to real life this ad 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.739
 example is the recent marketing studies 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.650
 they say it is the back hunchback for four 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:14.709
 or the comfortable 64 and is constantly 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.709
 beating the pc sector because it is more 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.109
 flexible on is found more 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.270
 and it's easier to configure then 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.210
 practically at this moment it is comfortable 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.130
 slam the pc obviously in the long run 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.750
 time this will not be because it says comfortable 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.810
 there are no longer many so many pc 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.630
 in fact you see the experts say that 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.550
 sooner or later this battle will end 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.169
 let's see some reviews as they go for 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.169
 glory to air soft gun hopefully good 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:53.170
 ahia I see a 4 and a 5 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.080
 unfortunately I don't like this game so much 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:00.100
 I have to say fan stage so I like every 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.530
 however, 24 and 25 is a video game 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.280
 which has not been very successful and 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.300
 let's see the sales of the first a 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.560
 week we see 2000 copies 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.240
 we have the job contracts I want 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.530
 show i directly in this video 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.090
 so almost ee so we have gods 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.370
 work contracts to do and let's get started 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.410
 pause for a moment you see now we have 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.540
 the possibility meanwhile sold 2500 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.310
 copies in the first week we are at 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.860
 rennes that 67 with this ok we see find 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.280
 contract practically works like this with 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.020
 contracts are additions for 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.640
 earn some extra money 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.560
 practically for three weeks not 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.760
 we develop nothing we have to make a logo 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.160
 for example 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.700
 and we are paid 17 but we must try 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.130
 to make 11 and 5 the penalty is minus 5 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.190
 so we have several playtest things 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.410
 will have 86 and will be four weeks e 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.660
 instead de bac program is one and a lot 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.700
 we don't have so much technology 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.650
 none of these for now why how 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.570
 money we are put on pretty well not 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.030
 so much pretty good 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.790
 among other things we are almost looking for and 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.390
 let's see game history and glory 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.730
 tor cloth which is the game in 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.500
 question for now is losing 20 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.490
 minus twenty-nine the next episode 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.350
 we will see how it will go lory trans tosca e 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.570
 keep writing about the gods 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:31.230
 beautiful comments for other games 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.230
 I am the brive na master and of breil
