00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
go down from the gas a little bit and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.470 
go down from the gas a little bit and
pull<00:01:16.800> my<00:01:17.010> aileron<00:01:17.760> my<00:01:18.210> tail<00:01:18.740> wing<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
pull my aileron my tail wing in the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.660 
pull my aileron my tail wing in the
opposite<00:01:21.900> side<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.830> turning<00:01:23.220> direction

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
opposite side of the turning direction

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.390 
opposite side of the turning direction
that<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.480> claim<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.500> spinning<00:01:25.800> when<00:01:26.250> I'm

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that my claim is spinning when I'm

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.720 
that my claim is spinning when I'm
controlled<00:01:27.150> again<00:01:27.830> I'm<00:01:28.830> giving<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.550> lot<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
controlled again I'm giving a lot of

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.410 
controlled again I'm giving a lot of
swaddle<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:32.750> pull<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.350> plane<00:01:34.620> up

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.500 

so<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.140> main<00:01:38.320> important<00:01:38.920> thing<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:40.420> first

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
so the main important thing is at first

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.890 
so the main important thing is at first
pull<00:01:42.900> down<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> throttle<00:01:44.060> not<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.660> much

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
pull down the throttle not get as much

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.000 
pull down the throttle not get as much
power<00:01:46.400> into

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
power into

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.359 
power into
your<00:01:49.670> rotor

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.760 

not<00:01:52.909> try<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.149> get<00:01:53.420> out<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.380> stall<00:01:54.560> by

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770

lost stuff right anyways this could be a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.900 
lost stuff right anyways this could be a
last<00:03:45.950> chance<00:03:46.450> for<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.770> how<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:49.580> do<00:03:49.790> it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
last chance for you so how you do it

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.650 
last chance for you so how you do it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
it's like that

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's like that
I<00:03:50.690> am<00:03:51.020> getting<00:03:51.230> into<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> stall<00:03:51.890> on<00:03:51.980> purpose

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
I am getting into the stall on purpose

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.530 
I am getting into the stall on purpose
and<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.610> immediately<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.450> again

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and get the immediately out of it again

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250 
and get the immediately out of it again
putting<00:03:56.380> gas<00:03:56.650> down<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.950> little<00:03:57.190> bit

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.369 

and<00:04:00.440> now<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:00.980> might<00:04:01.129> be<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.340> he<00:04:01.519> lost<00:04:01.930> or<00:04:02.930> that

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
and now it might be that he lost or that

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.020 
and now it might be that he lost or that
he<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:04.220> over<00:04:04.700> truth<00:04:04.909> or<00:04:05.390> something<00:04:06.909> it's<00:04:07.909> just

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
he be over truth or something it's just

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.410 
he be over truth or something it's just
a<00:04:08.510> good<00:04:09.140> last<00:04:09.620> trick<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.549> I'm<00:04:10.849> not<00:04:11.209> telling

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
a good last trick but I'm not telling

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.059 
a good last trick but I'm not telling
you<00:04:11.659> that<00:04:11.810> this<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.200> very<00:04:12.470> good<00:04:12.650> combat

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
you that this is a very good combat

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.640 
you that this is a very good combat
maneuver<00:04:13.489> or<00:04:13.610> something<00:04:14.030> it's<00:04:14.420> just<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:15.080> last

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
maneuver or something it's just a last

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.830 
maneuver or something it's just a last
hope<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.609> can<00:04:16.790> use<00:04:17.000> sometimes<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:19.840> get

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
hope that you can use sometimes to get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.300 
hope that you can use sometimes to get
your<00:04:21.019> opponent<00:04:21.410> off<00:04:21.470> guard<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.919> he<00:04:22.040> doesn't

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
your opponent off guard if he doesn't

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.450 
your opponent off guard if he doesn't
expect<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.760> or<00:04:22.940> she<00:04:23.810> could<00:04:24.050> mess<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.440> up<00:04:24.590> to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
expect it or she could mess it up to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.219 
expect it or she could mess it up to
stay<00:04:26.060> behind<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.690> this<00:04:26.810> kind<00:04:27.110> of

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
stay behind you in this kind of

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.740 
stay behind you in this kind of
situation<00:04:27.830> because<00:04:28.280> he's<00:04:29.150> not<00:04:29.360> going<00:04:29.720> to

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
situation because he's not going to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.840 
situation because he's not going to
expect<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.410> stall<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:31.070> this<00:04:31.250> situation

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
expect you to stall in this situation

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.820 
expect you to stall in this situation
you're<00:04:32.030> going<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.449> get<00:04:32.600> very<00:04:32.900> slow<00:04:33.229> very<00:04:33.380> fast

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
you're going to get very slow very fast

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.659 
you're going to get very slow very fast
so<00:04:34.639> he<00:04:35.150> might<00:04:35.389> overshoot<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:37.400> will

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
so he might overshoot you and you will

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.670 
so he might overshoot you and you will
never<00:04:37.820> expect<00:04:38.330> or<00:04:38.600> in<00:04:38.780> most<00:04:38.990> situations<00:04:39.289> you

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
never expect or in most situations you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.409 
never expect or in most situations you
won't<00:04:39.919> expect<00:04:40.340> someone<00:04:40.699> who's<00:04:40.940> getting<00:04:41.120> into

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
won't expect someone who's getting into

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.909 
won't expect someone who's getting into
a<00:04:41.510> stall<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:42.020> get<00:04:42.169> out<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.650> stall

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
a stall to get out of the stall

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.870 
a stall to get out of the stall
immediately<00:04:43.430> after<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.840> this<00:04:45.560> is<00:04:45.680> why<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.699> can

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
immediately after so this is why it can

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.110 
immediately after so this is why it can
be<00:04:46.940> helpful<00:04:47.479> but<00:04:47.960> what<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:49.310> course<00:04:49.639> is<00:04:49.940> going

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
be helpful but what of course is going
