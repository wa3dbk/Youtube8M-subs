going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> type<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.700> random<00:02:03.540> set<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
going to type in a random set of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.580 
going to type in a random set of
characters<00:02:04.579> this<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.640> used<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.270> confuse<00:02:06.780> Apple

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
characters this is used to confuse Apple

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580 
characters this is used to confuse Apple
music<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.520> doesn't<00:02:09.000> try<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> replace<00:02:10.229> your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
music so it doesn't try to replace your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.309 
music so it doesn't try to replace your
songs<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.129> their<00:02:11.280> own<00:02:11.870> okay<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
songs with their own okay so that's the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.940 
songs with their own okay so that's the
first<00:02:13.349> thing

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
first thing

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.850 
first thing
now<00:02:14.370> because<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.819> iTunes<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
now because it's iTunes we're going to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.050 
now because it's iTunes we're going to
have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> go<00:02:17.160> through<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.580> another<00:02:17.760> couple

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
have to go through just another couple

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.580 
have to go through just another couple
of<00:02:18.150> steps<00:02:18.330> here<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> saves<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> into

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of steps here because it saves it into

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.460 
of steps here because it saves it into
the<00:02:19.680> iTunes<00:02:19.830> database<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.349> go

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the iTunes database so I just have to go

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.510 
the iTunes database so I just have to go
through<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.340> click<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.790> each<00:02:23.819> song<00:02:25.520> to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
through here just click on each song to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.700 
through here just click on each song to
change<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.120> artists<00:02:27.599> name

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.980 

so<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:33.130> takes<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.490> second<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.330> until<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.810> is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
so this takes a second so until this is

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.410 
so this takes a second so until this is
done

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
done

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.210 
done
all<00:02:37.420> right<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.810> now<00:02:37.990> all<00:02:38.319> of<00:02:38.380> these<00:02:38.650> songs<00:02:38.920> have

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
all right so now all of these songs have

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.410 
all right so now all of these songs have
been<00:02:39.400> renamed<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.380> now<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:43.000> we'll<00:02:43.120> do<00:02:43.270> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
been renamed and now what we'll do is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.760 
been renamed and now what we'll do is
we're<00:02:43.600> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.840> now<00:02:44.560> upload<00:02:45.069> them<00:02:45.870> our<00:02:46.870> ad<00:02:47.440> to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
we're going to now upload them our ad to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.810 
we're going to now upload them our ad to
iCloud<00:02:48.190> music<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.980> two-step

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
iCloud music so this is a two-step

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.710 
iCloud music so this is a two-step
process<00:02:52.920> first<00:02:53.920> step<00:02:54.160> again<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.850> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
process first step again is this and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
process first step again is this and
what<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.020> will<00:02:56.200> do<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:56.950> these<00:02:57.130> this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
what this will do is because these this

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.800 
what this will do is because these this
you<00:02:58.480> know<00:02:58.600> artist<00:02:59.380> name<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.600> one<00:03:01.600> that's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
you know artist name is not one that's

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.430 
you know artist name is not one that's
in<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.319> know<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.620> iTunes<00:03:03.010> least<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.459> hope<00:03:03.610> not

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
in you know in iTunes least I hope not

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.220 
in you know in iTunes least I hope not
it<00:03:05.440> will<00:03:05.680> upload<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.430> these<00:03:07.060> songs<00:03:07.330> rather

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
it will upload all these songs rather

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.759 
it will upload all these songs rather
than<00:03:08.620> trying<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.040> match<00:03:09.250> any<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.790> them<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:11.050> alum

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
than trying to match any of them so alum

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.660 
than trying to match any of them so alum
art<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.760> right<00:03:13.120> versions<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.750> songs<00:03:14.670> once

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
art and the right versions of songs once

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.000 
art and the right versions of songs once
it<00:03:15.880> finishes<00:03:16.209> we<00:03:16.989> just<00:03:17.230> basically<00:03:17.380> reverse

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it finishes we just basically reverse

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.940 
it finishes we just basically reverse
the<00:03:18.190> process<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:19.570> go<00:03:19.780> into<00:03:21.360> got<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.470> go

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the process we go into got a and we go

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.420 
the process we go into got a and we go
and<00:03:24.570> replace<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> songs<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:26.950> think<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:27.310> can

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and replace the songs so I think we can

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.699 
and replace the songs so I think we can
just<00:03:27.459> do<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.760> while<00:03:28.030> we're<00:03:28.150> waiting<00:03:28.709> we'll

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
just do that while we're waiting we'll

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.420 
just do that while we're waiting we'll
find<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.130> if<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> messes<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.450> up<00:03:31.630> so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
find out if it messes it up so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.840 
find out if it messes it up so
essentially<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.910> go<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.420> musicbrainz<00:03:35.110> wizard

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
essentially you go to musicbrainz wizard

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.259 
essentially you go to musicbrainz wizard
you<00:03:36.850> delete<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.209> artist<00:03:37.570> name<00:03:37.720> obviously<00:03:38.230> and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you delete the artist name obviously and

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.759 
you delete the artist name obviously and
we're<00:03:40.269> going<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.480> search<00:03:40.690> for<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:41.019> album<00:03:41.290> and

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
we're going to search for this album and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.650 
we're going to search for this album and
it<00:03:42.160> should<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.850> other<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.209> at<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> top

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
it should be the other it is at the top

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.720 
it should be the other it is at the top
volume<00:03:44.650> six<00:03:45.160> we<00:03:45.459> say<00:03:45.640> V<00:03:45.850> release<00:03:47.370> continue<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
volume six we say V release continue and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.580 
volume six we say V release continue and
then<00:03:49.120> import<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.900> then<00:03:49.989> what<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.200> does<00:03:50.260> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
then import and then what this does is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.759 
then import and then what this does is
going<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.890> import<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.630> artist<00:03:53.019> back<00:03:53.230> as<00:03:53.560> they

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
going to import the artist back as they

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.440 
going to import the artist back as they
were<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:57.310> I'm<00:03:57.820> just<00:03:57.970> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.180> let<00:03:58.299> this

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
were and then I'm just going to let this

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.240 
were and then I'm just going to let this
finish<00:03:58.840> before<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.200> save<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.709> don't<00:04:00.010> want<00:04:00.160> to

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
finish before I save it I don't want to

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.470 
finish before I save it I don't want to
take<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> chance<00:04:00.459> on<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.500> modifying<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.680> data

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
take a chance on it modifying the data

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.850 
take a chance on it modifying the data
so<00:04:04.480> let<00:04:04.900> me<00:04:04.959> just<00:04:05.079> take<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> look<00:04:05.410> at<00:04:05.530> how<00:04:05.680> much

everything<00:04:20.229> as<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:21.190> intended<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.789> to<00:04:21.850> be<00:04:21.940> then

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
everything as you intended it to be then

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.110 
everything as you intended it to be then
we'll<00:04:23.080> fix<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.440> tags<00:04:23.710> after<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> fact<00:04:24.789> and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
we'll fix the tags after the fact and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.320 
we'll fix the tags after the fact and
the<00:04:25.270> nice<00:04:25.450> thing<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.610> police<00:04:28.120> did

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
the nice thing that I think a police did

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.529 
the nice thing that I think a police did
right<00:04:28.539> is<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.229> change<00:04:29.590> any<00:04:30.210> ID<00:04:31.210> three

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
right is if you do change any ID three

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.420 
right is if you do change any ID three
tag<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.860> will<00:04:33.190> update<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:34.570> song<00:04:35.320> on<00:04:35.740> your<00:04:36.160> iOS

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
tag it will update the song on your iOS

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.380 
tag it will update the song on your iOS
device

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
device

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.750 
device
in<00:04:37.450> real<00:04:37.690> time<00:04:37.930> pretty<00:04:38.140> much<00:04:38.760> without

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
in real time pretty much without

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.570 
in real time pretty much without
affecting<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.539> actual<00:04:41.190> content<00:04:42.190> so<00:04:42.340> any

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
affecting the actual content so any

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.850 
affecting the actual content so any
metadata<00:04:42.970> changes<00:04:43.539> aside<00:04:44.289> from<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.740> don't

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
metadata changes aside from I don't

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.150 
metadata changes aside from I don't
think

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
think

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.490 
think
album<00:04:45.430> art<00:04:45.720> will<00:04:46.720> be<00:04:46.870> done<00:04:47.110> although<00:04:47.470> I

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
album art will be done although I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.680 
album art will be done although I
haven't<00:04:47.800> tried<00:04:47.920> that<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.490> if<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.210> have<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.630> it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
haven't tried that so if you have and it

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.440

I<00:05:01.570> discovered<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.670> through<00:05:03.670> several<00:05:04.120> hours

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
I discovered this through several hours

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.730 
I discovered this through several hours
of<00:05:04.510> testing<00:05:06.060> yesterday<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.590> out<00:05:08.590> of

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
of testing yesterday and out of

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.700 
of testing yesterday and out of
frustration<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.750> seeing<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:10.900> Apple<00:05:11.260> hasn't

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
frustration and seeing that Apple hasn't

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.830 
frustration and seeing that Apple hasn't
really<00:05:12.460> publicly<00:05:12.880> said<00:05:13.120> anything<00:05:13.450> about<00:05:13.570> this

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
really publicly said anything about this

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.120 
really publicly said anything about this
and<00:05:14.260> since<00:05:14.890> this<00:05:15.100> has<00:05:15.310> been<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:16.020> issue<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.860> I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
and since this has been a issue that I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.950 
and since this has been a issue that I
think<00:05:18.430> kind<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.940> affected<00:05:19.650> since<00:05:20.650> Apple<00:05:21.490> has

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
think kind of affected since Apple has

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.200 
think kind of affected since Apple has
introduced<00:05:22.960> iTunes<00:05:23.350> Match<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:24.070> I'm<00:05:24.640> going<00:05:25.090> to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
introduced iTunes Match and I'm going to

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.420 
introduced iTunes Match and I'm going to
assume<00:05:25.540> that<00:05:25.750> they're<00:05:25.870> using<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.890> same<00:05:27.100> code

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
assume that they're using the same code

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.720 
assume that they're using the same code
base<00:05:27.640> for<00:05:28.060> at<00:05:28.210> least<00:05:28.360> part<00:05:28.660> of<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:29.460> for<00:05:30.460> doing

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
base for at least part of it for doing

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.290 
base for at least part of it for doing
matching<00:05:31.180> here<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:32.190> that<00:05:33.190> would<00:05:33.400> explain<00:05:33.790> why

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
matching here and that would explain why

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.470 
matching here and that would explain why
they've<00:05:34.990> never<00:05:35.170> fixed<00:05:35.560> this<00:05:35.710> or<00:05:36.330> why<00:05:37.330> it's

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
they've never fixed this or why it's

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.290 
they've never fixed this or why it's
still<00:05:37.750> broken<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.520> could<00:05:39.520> be<00:05:39.640> wrong<00:05:39.820> though<00:05:39.880> if

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
still broken I could be wrong though if

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.120 
still broken I could be wrong though if
there's<00:05:40.540> an<00:05:40.630> Apple<00:05:40.960> engineer<00:05:41.380> who<00:05:41.620> sees<00:05:41.950> this

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
there's an Apple engineer who sees this

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.020 
there's an Apple engineer who sees this
video<00:05:42.580> please<00:05:43.450> correct<00:05:44.170> me<00:05:44.350> if<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.560> am<00:05:44.680> wrong

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
video please correct me if I am wrong

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.430 
video please correct me if I am wrong
but<00:05:46.030> hopefully<00:05:46.360> what<00:05:46.510> I'm<00:05:46.780> with<00:05:47.170> what<00:05:47.320> I'm

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
but hopefully what I'm with what I'm

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.660 
but hopefully what I'm with what I'm
suggesting<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.640> Apple<00:05:49.000> do<00:05:49.210> is<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:50.650> give<00:05:51.550> you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
suggesting to Apple do is to give you

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.100 
suggesting to Apple do is to give you
the<00:05:51.700> option<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:53.010> not<00:05:54.010> try<00:05:54.790> to<00:05:54.820> match<00:05:55.120> an<00:05:55.540> album

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
the option to not try to match an album

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.300 
the option to not try to match an album
when<00:05:56.200> you<00:05:56.260> try<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.410> upload<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.920> and<00:05:57.070> then<00:05:57.190> that

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
when you try to upload it and then that

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.520 
when you try to upload it and then that
way<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.460> just<00:05:57.910> avoids<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.660> whole<00:05:58.900> this

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
way you just avoids this whole this

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.630 
way you just avoids this whole this
whole<00:05:59.590> mess<00:06:00.810> or<00:06:01.810> have<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.680> better<00:06:02.919> matching

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
whole mess or have a better matching

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.330 
whole mess or have a better matching
mechanism<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:05.680> would<00:06:05.770> be<00:06:05.890> better<00:06:06.070> but

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
mechanism that would be better but

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.980 
mechanism that would be better but
that's<00:06:06.700> asking<00:06:07.000> probably<00:06:07.300> for<00:06:07.450> too<00:06:07.540> much<00:06:07.690> okay

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
that's asking probably for too much okay

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.840 
that's asking probably for too much okay
so<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.380> last<00:06:08.800> step<00:06:09.040> in<00:06:09.160> this<00:06:09.250> process<00:06:09.520> again

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
so the last step in this process again

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.610 
so the last step in this process again
is<00:06:10.120> we're<00:06:10.300> going<00:06:10.390> to<00:06:10.480> save<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.230> correct

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
is we're going to save the the correct

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.590 
is we're going to save the the correct
two<00:06:11.770> metadata<00:06:12.220> and<00:06:12.940> then<00:06:13.270> we're<00:06:13.450> going<00:06:13.570> to

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
two metadata and then we're going to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.409 
two metadata and then we're going to
have<00:06:13.810> to<00:06:13.930> reverse<00:06:14.260> that<00:06:14.440> process<00:06:14.890> again<00:06:15.040> with

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
have to reverse that process again with

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.460 
have to reverse that process again with
the<00:06:16.419> music<00:06:18.570> so<00:06:19.570> we<00:06:19.660> just<00:06:19.840> go<00:06:20.020> through<00:06:20.290> just

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
the music so we just go through just

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:28.690 
the music so we just go through just
double<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.919> know<00:06:20.950> double<00:06:21.280> click<00:06:21.430> each<00:06:21.610> song

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.090 

and<00:06:29.660> what<00:06:29.870> this<00:06:29.990> will<00:06:30.140> do<00:06:30.320> is<00:06:30.620> this<00:06:30.860> is<00:06:30.920> going

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
and what this will do is this is going

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.820 
and what this will do is this is going
to<00:06:33.250> update<00:06:34.250> all<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.580> metadata<00:06:35.650> so<00:06:36.650> now<00:06:36.770> we

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
to update all the metadata so now we
