00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
let that be fun but actually I quite

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.949 
let that be fun but actually I quite
like<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.980> medium<00:02:27.280> because<00:02:28.000> um<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.810> was

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
like the medium because um I was

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.040 
like the medium because um I was
thinking<00:02:29.020> if<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:30.010> got<00:02:30.160> glamour<00:02:30.720> breaths<00:02:31.720> for

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
thinking if I got glamour breaths for

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.230 
thinking if I got glamour breaths for
her<00:02:32.200> she'd<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:33.220> buxom<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.970> they're

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
her she'd be so buxom that they're

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.760 
her she'd be so buxom that they're
probably<00:02:34.420> really<00:02:34.750> hard<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.290> her<00:02:35.470> into

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
probably really hard to get her into

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460 
probably really hard to get her into
clothing<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.030> thought<00:02:37.180> medium<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:38.350> be

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
clothing so I thought medium would be

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.590 
clothing so I thought medium would be
good<00:02:38.590> because<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.980> give<00:02:39.190> her<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.430> shape<00:02:39.760> but

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
good because I give her that shape but

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.070 
good because I give her that shape but
she<00:02:41.290> could<00:02:41.440> fit<00:02:41.650> into<00:02:41.800> stuff<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.900> looks<00:02:43.900> look

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
she could fit into stuff and looks look

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:57.120 
she could fit into stuff and looks look
at<00:02:44.170> her<00:02:44.230> face<00:02:44.680> up<00:02:55.380> she's<00:02:56.380> very<00:02:56.769> very<00:02:57.010> pretty

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
at her face up she's very very pretty

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.670 
at her face up she's very very pretty
and<00:02:57.550> she<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.930> face-up<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.380> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> make
