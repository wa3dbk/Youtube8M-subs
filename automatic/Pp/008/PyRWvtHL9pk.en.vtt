this is slightly rough this is because

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.710 
this is slightly rough this is because

my best should take out the pen from

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:41.390 
my best should take out the pen from
this<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:33.450> can<00:04:33.630> see<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.020> better<00:04:40.400> out

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
this so that you can see it better out

and we would then assume that that this

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.980 
and we would then assume that that this
