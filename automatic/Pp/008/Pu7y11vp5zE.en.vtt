00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
thank you it was once thought to be a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.069 
thank you it was once thought to be a
dubious<00:00:51.329> species<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> Tyrannosaur<00:00:52.020> called

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
dubious species of Tyrannosaur called

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
dubious species of Tyrannosaur called
absolute<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.250> once<00:00:56.399> thought<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
absolute on and then was once thought to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.229 
absolute on and then was once thought to
be<00:00:56.699> next<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> speaker<00:00:58.020> saw<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
be next at the speaker saw but then of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
be next at the speaker saw but then of
course<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.570> figured<00:01:00.840> any<00:01:01.260> wait<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> minute

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
course they figured any wait a minute

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.520 
course they figured any wait a minute
this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> different<00:01:02.520> species<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
this is actually a different species so

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
this is actually a different species so
the<00:01:04.530> main<00:01:04.710> bist<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.129> he<00:01:05.519> ever<00:01:05.729> sir<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.510> given<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the main bist I he ever sir was given to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.740 
the main bist I he ever sir was given to
it<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.400> means<00:01:08.820> bist<00:01:09.299> aji

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it which actually means bist aji

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.020 
it which actually means bist aji

was quite a large genus of pterosaur was
about<00:01:18.479> nine<00:01:18.780> meters<00:01:19.110> long<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:20.130> probably

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
about nine meters long was probably

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.289 
about nine meters long was probably
about<00:01:20.780> eight<00:01:21.780> ten<00:01:22.110> feet<00:01:22.290> tall<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.150> was<00:01:24.150> about

about eight ten feet tall and was about

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.080 
about eight ten feet tall and was about
a<00:01:24.330> ton<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.110> weight<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.759> lived<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
Kirtland formation of North America

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.130 
Kirtland formation of North America
about<00:01:29.430> seventy<00:01:30.000> four<00:01:30.180> million<00:01:30.360> years<00:01:30.540> ago<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
about seventy four million years ago and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.310 
about seventy four million years ago and
Late<00:01:31.290> Cretaceous<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.640> preyed<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
Late Cretaceous and would have preyed on

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.080 
Late Cretaceous and would have preyed on
many<00:01:34.320> species<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.650> hadrosaur<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.549> could

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
many species of hadrosaur like could

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.780 
many species of hadrosaur like could
Soros<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> Parasaurolophus<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> even<00:01:38.549> some

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
Soros and Parasaurolophus and even some

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.100 
Soros and Parasaurolophus and even some
of<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.360> top<00:01:39.509> sins<00:01:39.780> like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
of these are our top sins like

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.819 
of these are our top sins like
pentaceratops<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.220> Titanus<00:01:41.850> era<00:01:42.060> tops<00:01:42.829> so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
pentaceratops and Titanus era tops so

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.090 
pentaceratops and Titanus era tops so
that<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.570> into<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> model<00:01:46.619> itself

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that way let's get into the model itself

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.710 
that way let's get into the model itself
now<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.630> say<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
now I say this is actually a really

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.160 
now I say this is actually a really
really<00:01:51.899> surprisingly<00:01:52.970> good<00:01:53.970> mod<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> mean<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
really surprisingly good mod I mean the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690 
really surprisingly good mod I mean the
first<00:01:55.350> thing<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.770> point<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.219> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
first thing that I will point out this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
first thing that I will point out this
guy<00:01:57.000> has<00:01:57.329> got<00:01:57.570> feathers<00:01:58.530> all<00:01:59.750> over<00:02:00.750> his<00:02:01.170> body

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
guy has got feathers all over his body

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
guy has got feathers all over his body
I<00:02:02.299> this<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.570> absolutely<00:02:04.049> terrific<00:02:05.719> now<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> mean

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I this is absolutely terrific now I mean

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.740 
I this is absolutely terrific now I mean
I'm<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.500> sure<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.750> adult

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
I'm not really sure if like adult

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
I'm not really sure if like adult
tyrannosaurs<00:02:10.560> would<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.979> had<00:02:11.160> feathers<00:02:11.489> but

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
tyrannosaurs would have had feathers but

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
tyrannosaurs would have had feathers but
it's<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.780> pretty

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's a pretty

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.520 
it's a pretty
