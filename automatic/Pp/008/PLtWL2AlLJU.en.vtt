00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 as many already know sony and marvel 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 made a deal on a spiderman and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 spider heads will appear in their new films 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.540
 that is, civil war and the following 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 avengers and so on it all gave 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 opportunity to abate the war between 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 camps return tobi and capsules better 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.840
 After all, the second pair to retrain 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 in return the garfield yes yes he is definitely not 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.020
 will return to this role sony confirmed 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 this fact almost immediately 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 but then who will play the spider now and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.869
 try to find out and I forgot to say hello 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.869
 for all those who listen to fireworks, let's go 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.680
 so on the latest news there are 95 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 the percentage probability that we have soon 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 there will be two spider people on the big one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.010
 screen jeff snider reported that in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 avengers and civil war will appear 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 white spider is not even 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.059
 being discussed 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.070
 and here is his next solo film 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.920
 It will probably be about the Morales miles 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 there is a black boy about me 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 new is not at all happy but we are here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.810
 gathered not for the sake of this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.050
 learn all the possible actors for the role 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:19.050
 white spider man all-all end 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.180
 I didn’t want to honestly really western 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.740
 the press surprised me by designating a few 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 pretty intricate candidates for the role 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 adhesions in the main sheet included as many as nine 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 man let's start with ours and this is a 25 year old 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 actor anton yelchin who was born in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.979
 Leningrad and now with might and main star in 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.810
 states 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.640
 he was one of the most important candidates 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.250
 the last time you chose a garfield and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.080
 he remains to them to this day experience in the cinema 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 great roles in cool movies were 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
 talent on the spot can be chosen 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 antoha and maybe nicholas holt 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.200
 of that same hank macao from x-men i 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.250
 was a little surprised to see him in shorts 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 sheet for the role of spidea 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.990
 who knows before him and to restaurants has been 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.510
 first a human torch and then 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.640
 quite successfully became a cap withers also 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.430
 25 years and he also childhood in the movies 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.619
 experience a lot of charisma is there but does it fit 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.659
 type and I now do not know if they know 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.489
 the creators of the future of cinema can not only 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.530
 they know they may have already chosen dylan 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.330
 O'Brien is a still younger star 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.519
 which is also on the big now 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 lifting many knew about it passwords 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.900
 running through the maze I'm like a serial 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.239
 Zadrot remember even the very first season 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.190
 little wolf there he plays a very talkative 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.709
 funny little awkward boy 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.750
 Stiles name is not mentioned as 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.000
 me so much the spiderman 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.299
 At night, I ’m picking out candidates, so 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.010
 It has a good chance for Michael Angarano 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.870
 I didn't remember his name 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.700
 it turns out its 27 years old has played in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.500
 a huge amount of non primary roles and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.079
 the most significant at the moment is 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.820
 the role of the doctor in the series for the moment its me like 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.579
 once in the autumn I looked and by the way everyone 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.560
 I advise but I can not say that this 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.830
 the actor remembered something there 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.350
 really honest 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.170
 but in Hollywood uncles know better 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.280
 they are in hollywood i'm not in line 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.470
 Brand Waits 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.000
 I honestly do not know who it is but foreign 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.430
 journalists and consider him one of the most 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.960
 the main candidates for photos with me 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.540
 something reminded the actor who is now 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.400
 flash plays his list of future works on 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.320
 film search to show that he is filmed in 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.760
 new pirates johnny depp and in tanks 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.890
 Egypt with Gerard Butler 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 It means not just this kid can 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.910
 because of the role of the wand cling perhaps 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.100
 the most sudden nominee on the list for 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.350
 me this is insanely talented joseph 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.210
 gordon-levitt im over thirty and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.550
 at first it seems that there is no chance at all 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.010
 after all because of age from the same reached 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.300
 parts refused however goes news 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.820
 what does he need only to express his desire 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.140
 the contract will be instantly signed because 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.510
 marvel wishes to get 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.580
 this actor to his caste and even looks 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.160
 he is younger insanely of course but 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.450
 you never know 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.720
 the next likely candidate is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.850
 jack about but they few knew until 2014 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.770
 this year was a breakthrough year for 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.780
 jack now he has become one of the most 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.360
 promising and sought-after talents 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.370
 of my generation if I broadcast again 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.170
 about TV shows I saw Jack a long time ago 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.110
 well suckers or skin if not 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.820
 translate the guy clearly has a future but 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.470
 on the other hand, he himself is not very 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.959
 wants to connect his life in the movies with 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.150
 similar management therefore it also 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.220
 persuade may need to be so not 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.650
 I do not know whether it will go on this arrow 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.140
 left two and the first will be logan 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.060
 Lerman think Donata went everyone knows and I 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.650
 To be honest I was sure for a long time that they were 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.690
 he will play the role of a spider instead 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.790
 Garfield I somehow else in my school 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.220
 years read the news that it was approved 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.260
 for this role and then just everyone else 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.210
 News deaf ear to so 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.919
 I turned out to be a revelation that logan and 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.410
 cordoned off because of too young age 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.450
 and the role was given to Garfield, although this too 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.940
 did not disappoint played Kane as for me 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.890
 so logan is now 22 and he sees 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.530
 one of the most obvious and most 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.820
 suitable options for this role 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.500
 we have the last jerome on the list 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.660
 irene who broke into a hollywood movie 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.310
 steven spielberg warhorse 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.590
 from the moment he was filmed only in 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.150
 independent cinema but rumor has it that 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.350
 Hollywood you can return just 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.450
 the role of spider daring 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.820
 on this list of all the main candidates 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.190
 fits the end I personally do not want to highlight 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.440
 some favorites and list 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.030
 but it was already done to me, sort of like 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.190
 most rumors are connected exactly 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.860
 made by brian and moisture us lerman 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.540
 them that soon we will find out who will fall on 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.060
 little radioactive you get to and 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.280
 new wave of popularity but this is clearly 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.070
 will be someone from my list I for sure 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.560
 I know by the way I'm here a new subscription plate 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.270

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.290
 to this button well because of the cast 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.210
 there for trying the edges modestly hinting 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.310
 Like if you click and thank you 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.900
 and respect this was all here but 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.580
 that he would have not refused to tailor 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.350
 spiderman and who reminds you 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.350
