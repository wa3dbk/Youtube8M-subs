00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.380
 here 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.760
 swell is stationary and wind 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.960
 low it's noon on the canals 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.190
 hello to all in one time 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.110
 which is pleasant variable a 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.200
 outside temperature at 24 degrees a 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.730
 water temperature has a very good 18 ° 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.980
 mid-March and that shows the full boom and to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.059
 3:40 pm with coefficients of 50 on this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.790
 amount but the wind is still a 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.470
 strong west light to moderate and 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.480
 really not strong and is a little leap 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.610
 strong taser and 3 are small bursts 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.320
 barely 2 we still have a body of water 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.879
 who is a little agitated yesterday a little bridled 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.300
 a little lapping the phases of grace 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.890
 of the iss 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.540
 but still this swell that is enough 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 consistent of 10 second periods 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.660
 west to west northwest 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 multiply and waved delivering a good 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.259
 match 50 on the axle pretty sail 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.880
 messy there are waves off to 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.680
 waves in port is pretty selective 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.119
 it's still pretty powerful there is 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.560
 not to put away from there but it's a 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.390
 good meter fifty who this shot behind 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.830
 the ears still there some 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.750
 people off a few people to 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.490
 board and it's hard to see them catch 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 waves worthwhile boyer of what's 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.369
 put in the water story to deceive 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.380
 to try to catch tastes but 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.690
 it's far from being regular and it's not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.250
 accessible for everyone for 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.360
 pass the bar and after to surf the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.800
 waves the evolution for the rest of the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.440
 day the cash power on continues 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.580
 drop to 1 meter 90 and 7 seconds but 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.350
 where one at the end of the day will be 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.179
 really slight drop it's not ok but 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.830
 it is frankly and the wind is expected 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.110
 get stronger to see what's going to give 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.640
 because already at noon it will be less strong 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 than expected and maybe that's near this 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 afternoon with the marriott it will be the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 same story so 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 tartas singing the buoy her and 1,90 and 7 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.229
 seconds 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.500
 I like to repeat myself we expect the same 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.569
 at 13h 50 m or west and north west 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 west 10 second period van walsum of 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.289
 Beaufort and said it helps to put 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 50 or west and west northwest 10 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.409
 second period with a planned jump here 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.420
 an ounce of three strong words but that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.340
 it is far from sure I would say 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.989
 inform on 08 92 29 78 73 at 14h 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.989
 16h and 18h ​​the good day thank you
