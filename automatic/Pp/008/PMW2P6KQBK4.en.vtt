00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
statement and a higher proof I think

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.690

sort of a brand type thing they're going

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.059 
sort of a brand type thing they're going
through<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.840> unit<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.230> medicine<00:04:04.709> bottle

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
through the unit the medicine bottle

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.640 
through the unit the medicine bottle
with<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.819> raised<00:04:06.000> lettering<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.470> want

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
with the raised lettering so they want

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.110 
with the raised lettering so they want
just<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.890> little<00:04:08.099> bit<00:04:08.190> of<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.370> rough<00:04:08.519> edge<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:09.000> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
just a little bit of a rough edge to it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.449 
just a little bit of a rough edge to it
which<00:04:09.560> isn't<00:04:10.560> really<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.370> it's

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
which isn't really that you know it's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.399 
which isn't really that you know it's
not<00:04:11.550> that<00:04:11.610> rough<00:04:11.879> but<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.330> just<00:04:12.810> um<00:04:12.989> just

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
not that rough but it's just um just

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.949 
not that rough but it's just um just
enough<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.220> fit<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.180> branding<00:04:15.599> they're<00:04:15.780> going

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
enough to fit the branding they're going

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.750 
enough to fit the branding they're going
certainly<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.440> think<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.769> was<00:04:16.859> really<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.609> it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
certainly I think it was really and it

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.940 
certainly I think it was really and it
does<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.390> appeal<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> general<00:04:19.260> public

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950
