00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.030
 after a long time of videos 4 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.140
 4 gsm 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.810
 blocked by the club 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.299
 good our here how to skip step 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.100
 this 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.790
 leave something and bury the screen 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790
 that this 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.169
 and good as they are bags to go 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.169
 and you see them here then here 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 approximate 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.969
 but 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.309
 next same 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.200
 that is no longer a beginning, we are going to 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.200
 do the process again 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.189
 this method is called activation by 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.320
 bypass is a somewhat simple method but 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.320
 everyone knows profile 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.790
 I understand that in this hour the club 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.300
 but when this forum could not be 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.030
 why 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.230
 there's one more problem with him I do not know which one 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.900
 still be still 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.900
 but he could not do anything else 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.180
 we have to jailbreak but 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.829
 we can not hide good evasion in my 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.840
 case can not with evasion or with breaks 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 break because the iphone is not activated 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.220
 in deactivating it before doing the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.220
 jailbreak or when you go jones 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.220
 already in the texts to respect 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.220
 in concert 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.690
 good reason because this video is because 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.810
 many have trouble with this step 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.590
 and all that stuff but anyway I only know 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.590
 I can do this for a moment 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.590
 tearing 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.880
 it is the language of the country 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.480
 and the arias warnings is the following 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.920
 and press the home button 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.920
 we go to the cbc call 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.200
 and here we're going to mark 1 1 2 and we're going to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.650
 mark in what will be the level of above 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.650
 we have to block it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.930
 come on, the first step will be debate 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.170
 like four times the first time a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.170
 propeller 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.770
 because it is not so easy to allocate the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.990
 moment but good no longer here we go 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.520
 to give the option of contacts to be 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.380
 contacts and here we will add one 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.770
 thanks to write or anything we add 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.770
 a picture 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.840
 of photos and fast 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.459
 and use pictures 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.120
 it can be has to have the simple not 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.680
 we can the bag see when we are in 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.879
 want the contact 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.879
 let's press three times 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.159
 to stay with that then 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 let's select because the east 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.400
 number 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.090
 let's go twice 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.980
 and three times in a row 1 2 3 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.860
 and hey, he sends us here directly 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.860
 here 3 3 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.360
 we already have access to the phone but not 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.200
 we can access nothing more 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.970
 as I said right now 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.019
 only here is face time 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.019
 another thing 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.700
 here 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.740
 so you do not have to use it the bad 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 luck 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.389
 and again we have to restart it but 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.490
 Anyway , that's all because part of 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.770
 served with the iphone 4 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.800
 4g gsm 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.800
 the same is that it 's promoted let's say
