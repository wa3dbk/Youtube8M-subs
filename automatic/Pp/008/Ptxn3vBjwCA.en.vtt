00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.300
 so after a few long months 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.719
 of absence here I am for a new 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.580
 smoke video so easy so 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.859
 here i will show you how to do 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.830
 smoke with potassium nitrate 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 classic ie with sugar and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.880
 chocolate you have to be very careful 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 because it's still pretty 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.099
 dangerous in the sense that if it heats 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.200
 too hard it goes without flames he in 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 your pan 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.840
 the first step is to take 40 g 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 of sugar put it in a saucepan 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 here we sometimes have to and do it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.200
 heat with a little bit of fat 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200
 low 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 1 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.430
 it is essential to avoid 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.070
 gas cookers because it heats 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.940
 way too heavy and when we try 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.880
 to grab a mixture of hygiene our 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 adaptation with an iran gal kitchen 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.500
 usually assembles 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.650
 the sugar begins to caramelize 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.430
 or decrease the thermostat and you 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.230
 add potassium nitrate 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 once the potassium nitrate and 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.850
 mix with the sugar makes very 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 attention of the temperature if ever that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.870
 heats up too much it goes together for 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 avoid that some 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.400
 do not hesitate to taste a lot of water 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 like the taste to its degree by trains 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.430
 keep erasures 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 among others you can also add 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 about g of bicarbonate is 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.920
 Melenchon or discomfort it will not 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 hygiene to sink more slowly and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.320
 to have more shots 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.120
 so once it's done you pour 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 preparation in a cardboard tube 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.770
 you can just against a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.870
 cardboard sheet packing piece 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.319
 you relay on the little bits of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.170
 tape and it takes once it 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.819
 of gold you take sends a spoon of 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.660
 anything you need to click at 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.519
 middle so to make a hole 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.730
 and then just put a wick of 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.630
 in the best smoke smokers of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.030
 potassium is the shock 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.239
 now you can have a result 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.910
 very very very close by mixing the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.640
 same dose of potassium nitrate and 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.959
 below so 60 g of potassium 40 on it 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.870
 and you just mix with 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.030
 water and then to get you a paste 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.780
 that you let dry 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 that hardens and it made a more 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:16.670
 lightly good of course you hear the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.319
 parrot right if you want some but 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.959
 I live as I use you can go 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.360
 take a ride on the extreme site 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.720
 point com experience that has been precisely 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.530
 refurbished completely 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.810
 besides the domain has loaded 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.000
 now expresses is experimenting with can 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.800
 why because I decided to do 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.519
 an anglophone part is also the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.239
 most of my videos will be from now on 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:50.530
 Available in French and in English 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.530
 now let 's pass the test 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.299
 so here will accuse 9 50 grams 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.299
 unfortunately there was a lot 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.450
 so here I would put you very 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.270
 soon also other videos under 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:27.550
 the rain I managed smoke type 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.190
 military smoke and also the famous 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.770
 colored fumigants 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:37.290
 so we find ourselves very quickly to 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.290
 other videos hi
