tartaglia is a new lasik procedure that

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.599 
tartaglia is a new lasik procedure that
we're<00:00:23.160> calling<00:00:23.609> pml<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.830> what<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
we're calling pml and what it is is it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.070 
we're calling pml and what it is is it's
a<00:00:26.939> procedure<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.990> allows<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:30.210> individual

a procedure that allows the individual

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.549 
a procedure that allows the individual
to<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.590> both<00:00:31.890> distance<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> near<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to see both distance and near so it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.250 
to see both distance and near so it's
taking<00:00:34.950> laser<00:00:35.820> procedures<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.840> we've<00:00:37.050> done

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

before and combining them in a new way

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.000 
before and combining them in a new way
to<00:00:40.460> allow<00:00:41.460> depth<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.210> focus<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.230> after

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to allow depth of focus so that after

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
in the distance but also have that depth

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.569 
in the distance but also have that depth
of<00:00:50.610> focus<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.690> close<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.260> well<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.860> have

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
I could still see well at distance but I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.890

I'm<00:02:26.280> excited<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.420> expect<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.819> deed

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
I'm excited and I expect it to be deed

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.030 
I'm excited and I expect it to be deed
results<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.480> excellent<00:02:30.810> initially<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
results to be excellent initially it's a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.449 
results to be excellent initially it's a
two-step<00:02:32.640> procedure<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.260> first<00:02:34.560> part<00:02:35.430> of

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
two-step procedure in the first part of

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.030 
two-step procedure in the first part of
the<00:02:35.580> procedure<00:02:35.880> we're<00:02:36.300> creating<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> flap<00:02:37.140> so

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the procedure we're creating the flap so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280 
the procedure we're creating the flap so
what<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.400> do<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.610> put<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> small<00:02:39.480> suction<00:02:39.900> ring

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
what we do is put a small suction ring

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.339 
what we do is put a small suction ring
on<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> eye<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:42.090> holds<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.599> still<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
on the eye and it holds the I still and

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.080 
on the eye and it holds the I still and
allows<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> laser<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.709> preset<00:02:46.709> by<00:02:46.950> me<00:02:47.220> with

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
allows a laser that is preset by me with

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.320 
allows a laser that is preset by me with
a<00:02:48.120> computer<00:02:48.630> with<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> precise<00:02:50.010> depth<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.850> size

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
a computer with a precise depth and size

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.620 
a computer with a precise depth and size
of<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.530> flap<00:02:52.920> that's<00:02:53.760> done<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> first

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
of a flap that's done with the first

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.199 
of a flap that's done with the first
laser<00:02:54.989> then<00:02:55.769> after<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.400> done<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
laser then after that's done and that

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.270 
laser then after that's done and that
procedure<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.840> very<00:02:57.870> brief<00:02:58.380> once<00:02:58.769> we<00:02:58.920> put<00:02:59.130> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
procedure is very brief once we put the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.370 
procedure is very brief once we put the
suction<00:02:59.670> ring<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.170> about<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
suction ring on it's on for about a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.100 
suction ring on it's on for about a
minute<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:02.190> each<00:03:02.400> eye<00:03:02.610> then<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.660> take<00:03:03.900> and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
minute with each eye then we take and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.809 
minute with each eye then we take and
move<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.440> patient<00:03:04.650> into<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> second<00:03:05.580> room

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
move the patient into a second room

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.720 
move the patient into a second room
which<00:03:06.569> has<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.080> excimer<00:03:07.530> laser<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.310> excimer

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
which has the excimer laser the excimer

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.420 
which has the excimer laser the excimer
laser<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> laser<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:10.019> actually<00:03:10.440> puts<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
laser is the laser that actually puts in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.610 
laser is the laser that actually puts in
the<00:03:12.030> prescription<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.959> treatment<00:03:13.410> for

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the prescription and the treatment for

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.740 
the prescription and the treatment for
the<00:03:13.709> patient<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.269> bring<00:03:15.299> them<00:03:15.630> in

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
the patient so we can to bring them in

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.289 
the patient so we can to bring them in
the<00:03:15.870> second<00:03:16.290> room<00:03:16.530> get<00:03:17.519> everything<00:03:17.790> set<00:03:18.269> up

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
the second room get everything set up

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.930 
the second room get everything set up
and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.200> room<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.769> gently<00:03:20.370> lift<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and then in that room I gently lift the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.180 
and then in that room I gently lift the
flap<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.930> was<00:03:22.109> created<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.650> first<00:03:22.680> room

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
flap that was created in the first room

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.120 
flap that was created in the first room
and<00:03:23.459> do<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.359> procedure<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:25.769> put<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
and do the procedure and then put the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.699 
and do the procedure and then put the
flat<00:03:26.340> back<00:03:26.609> down<00:03:26.850> most<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:28.109> spent

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
flat back down most of the time is spent

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.009 
flat back down most of the time is spent
getting<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.310> flap<00:03:29.579> back<00:03:30.090> down<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> procedure

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
getting the flap back down the procedure

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.009 
getting the flap back down the procedure
itself<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.590> very<00:03:31.650> brief<00:03:32.190> with<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.090> laser<00:03:33.299> then

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
itself is very brief with the laser then

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.990 
itself is very brief with the laser then
I<00:03:34.170> spend<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.829> time<00:03:34.980> getting<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.730> flat

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
I spend a lot of time getting the flat

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.259 
I spend a lot of time getting the flat
back<00:03:36.299> in<00:03:36.540> perfect<00:03:36.959> position<00:03:37.160> afterwards<00:03:38.269> it

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
back in perfect position afterwards it

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.979 
back in perfect position afterwards it
was<00:03:40.579> very<00:03:42.230> non-traumatic<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:45.299> thought

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
was very non-traumatic that I I thought

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.870 
was very non-traumatic that I I thought
it<00:03:46.170> might<00:03:46.200> be<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.709> bothersome<00:03:47.280> I<00:03:47.459> thought<00:03:47.670> I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
it might be more bothersome I thought I

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.270 
it might be more bothersome I thought I
would<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:49.079> little<00:03:49.350> harder<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.010> around

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
would be a little harder to get around

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.640 
would be a little harder to get around
but<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.820> got<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:52.019> course<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
but I got up and of course one of the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.430 
but I got up and of course one of the
techs<00:03:52.890> had<00:03:53.250> had<00:03:53.760> her<00:03:53.880> arm<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.390> mean<00:03:55.079> she<00:03:55.230> said

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
techs had had her arm I mean she said

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.789 
techs had had her arm I mean she said
I'll<00:03:55.590> I'll<00:03:55.829> I'll<00:03:55.890> make<00:03:56.519> sure<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.819> do<00:03:56.970> okay<00:03:57.359> I

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
I'll I'll I'll make sure you do okay I

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.559 
I'll I'll I'll make sure you do okay I
expected<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:59.010> be<00:03:59.040> easy<00:03:59.370> but<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.480> was

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
expected it to be easy but it was

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.960 
expected it to be easy but it was
actually<00:04:00.900> easier<00:04:01.200> than<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.560> thought<00:04:01.790> what<00:04:02.790> was

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
actually easier than I thought what was

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.690 
actually easier than I thought what was
interesting<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.510> me<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.019> at<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.459> end<00:04:05.579> of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
interesting to me is that at the end of

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.860 
interesting to me is that at the end of
the<00:04:05.790> surgery<00:04:06.230> we<00:04:07.230> have<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:08.150> shields<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.660> are

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the surgery we have I shields that are

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.840 
the surgery we have I shields that are
taped<00:04:10.200> onto<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:10.799> eye<00:04:10.889> they're<00:04:11.459> clear

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
taped onto your eye they're clear

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.710 
taped onto your eye they're clear
plastic<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.630> they're<00:04:12.840> still<00:04:14.030> curve<00:04:15.030> plastic

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
plastic but they're still curve plastic

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560 
plastic but they're still curve plastic
and<00:04:15.959> non<00:04:16.590> optical<00:04:17.250> quality<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.329> course

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
and non optical quality and of course

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.770 
and non optical quality and of course
then<00:04:18.750> there's<00:04:18.900> tape<00:04:19.169> across<00:04:19.700> but<00:04:20.700> when<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.479> got

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
then there's tape across but when I got

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.510 
then there's tape across but when I got
up<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.109> stood<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.800> front<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> group

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
up and stood up in front of the group

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.740 
up and stood up in front of the group
there<00:04:23.789> that<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.120> watching<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.630> surgery

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
there that was watching the surgery
