worst<00:01:59.180> venting<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.299> my<00:02:00.420> opinion<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
worst venting in my opinion was the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
worst venting in my opinion was the
front<00:02:01.619> venting<00:02:02.040> which<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.490> took<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:02.909> about<00:02:03.180> two

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
front venting which I took off about two

front venting which I took off about two
days<00:02:03.600> ago<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.770> see<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> creates<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.490> major

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
days ago we can see it creates a major

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
days ago we can see it creates a major
holes<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.409> both<00:02:07.560> ends<00:02:07.770> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
holes there so and it's both ends on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.140 
holes there so and it's both ends on
both<00:02:07.920> sides<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.610> personally<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
both sides so personally I would have to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.770 
both sides so personally I would have to
to<00:02:12.150> find<00:02:12.330> something<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.720> block<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.410> just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
to find something to block it but just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.620 
to find something to block it but just
piece<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.080> plastic<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.180> try<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> fix<00:02:16.420> that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
piece of plastic and try to fix that

situation custom-made bumper heavy-duty
bumper<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:23.590> think<00:02:23.950> that's<00:02:24.100> about<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> it's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.120 
bumper and I think that's about it it's
the<00:02:24.640> same<00:02:24.790> venting<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.330> other<00:02:25.450> side

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the same venting on the other side

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.030 
the same venting on the other side
holding<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.640> shop<00:02:27.850> tower<00:02:28.410> fell<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
shop tire and the side venting now for

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.220
