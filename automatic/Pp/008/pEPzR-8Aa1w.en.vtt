00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
you've got to wait around 12 hours

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.400 
you've got to wait around 12 hours
before<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.360> need<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> next<00:00:15.780> piece<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.289> can

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
before you need the next piece so it can

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.330 
before you need the next piece so it can
dry<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.850> kind<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.090> frustrating<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
dry and it's kind of frustrating and the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.950 
dry and it's kind of frustrating and the
other<00:00:20.460> problem<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.420> can't<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.779> all<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
other problem is you can't get all the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.439 
other problem is you can't get all the
paint<00:00:22.170> out<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.500> these<00:00:22.619> guys<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.269> can

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
paint out of these guys so what you can

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.470 
paint out of these guys so what you can
do<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.550> heat<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.670> up<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.970> some<00:00:27.000> hot<00:00:27.269> water

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
do is heat them up with some hot water

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
do is heat them up with some hot water
and<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.170> makes<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> lot<00:00:28.650> more<00:00:28.680> running<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and it makes them a lot more running and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.810 
and it makes them a lot more running and
then<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.830> can<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:32.009> more<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.219> paint<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.790> of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then you can get more than paint out of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.990 
then you can get more than paint out of
the<00:00:32.910> bottle

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
the bottle

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
the bottle
let's<00:00:36.000> trim<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> sink<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> heat<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
let's trim in the sink then heat up a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
let's trim in the sink then heat up a
bit<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.230> comes<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.710> really

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
bit and then it just comes out really

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:53.580 
bit and then it just comes out really
nice<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.379> back<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> webbing

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.100 

now<00:00:54.250> for<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.550> gloves<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.480> hard<00:00:55.720> part<00:00:56.020> was

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
now for the gloves the hard part was

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.930 
now for the gloves the hard part was
getting<00:00:56.800> them<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.100> shape<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.580> I<00:00:57.640> could

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
getting them in the shape so I could

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.670 
getting them in the shape so I could
whip<00:00:58.150> them<00:00:58.360> so<00:00:58.630> what<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.810> did<00:00:58.990> was<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.230> took<00:00:59.290> some

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
whip them so what I did was I took some

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.700 
whip them so what I did was I took some
wooden<00:01:00.070> dowels<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:00.700> then<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:02.140> stuck<00:01:02.560> them

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
wooden dowels and then just stuck them

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.560 
wooden dowels and then just stuck them
in<00:01:02.860> as<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.100> fingers<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.700> then<00:01:04.000> basically<00:01:04.330> did

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
in as the fingers and then basically did

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.530 
in as the fingers and then basically did
one<00:01:04.900> finger<00:01:05.290> at<00:01:05.380> a<00:01:05.440> time<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.640> again<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:07.060> kind<00:01:07.510> of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
one finger at a time so again it kind of

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.120 
one finger at a time so again it kind of
took<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.720> while<00:01:07.990> but<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.500> was<00:01:08.590> worth<00:01:08.800> it<00:01:09.010> because

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
took a while but it was worth it because

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.210 
took a while but it was worth it because
I<00:01:09.610> was<00:01:09.760> able<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.030> do<00:01:10.360> some<00:01:11.140> pretty<00:01:11.220> pretty

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220

I was able to do some pretty pretty
accurate<00:01:12.580> webbing<00:01:12.850> on<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.150> fingers<00:01:13.480> which<00:01:14.020> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110
