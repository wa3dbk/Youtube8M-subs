dropping the x10 faded in and out and
exhibited<00:03:46.600> static<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.620> we<00:03:47.769> know<00:03:47.920> there's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
exhibited static so we know there's

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
definitely a difference with reception

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.229 
definitely a difference with reception
but<00:03:50.170> as<00:03:50.290> far<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.500> battery<00:03:50.769> life<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.549> x10<00:03:52.000> has

but as far as battery life the x10 has

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.979 
but as far as battery life the x10 has
pretty<00:03:52.600> good<00:03:52.690> battery<00:03:53.200> life<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:53.769> set<00:03:54.040> both<00:03:54.250> the

one of the best battery performances
we've<00:04:06.250> seen<00:04:06.579> this<00:04:06.760> year<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.720> still<00:04:07.930> up

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
we've seen this year but it's still up

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.470 
we've seen this year but it's still up
there<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.040> sony<00:04:09.280> ericsson<00:04:09.489> x10<00:04:10.209> worth

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
there so is the sony ericsson x10 worth

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.640 
there so is the sony ericsson x10 worth
that<00:04:10.900> Android<00:04:11.290> 2.1<00:04:11.859> upgrade<00:04:12.850> you<00:04:13.840> know<00:04:13.959> even

that Android 2.1 upgrade you know even

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.449 
that Android 2.1 upgrade you know even
then<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.790> wouldn't<00:04:16.269> compare<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> samsung

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
then it wouldn't compare to a samsung

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.090 
then it wouldn't compare to a samsung
