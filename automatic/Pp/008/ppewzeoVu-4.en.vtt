00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410 

Oh

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.750 

I<00:00:05.740> think<00:00:06.740> every<00:00:06.980> time<00:00:07.130> we<00:00:07.310> head<00:00:07.460> out<00:00:07.580> on<00:00:07.670> a<00:00:07.730> tour

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
I think every time we head out on a tour

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.549 
I think every time we head out on a tour
the<00:00:08.120> pressure<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:08.600> bring<00:00:09.110> something<00:00:09.410> new<00:00:09.530> to

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
the pressure to bring something new to

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.440 
the pressure to bring something new to
the<00:00:09.650> table<00:00:09.740> something<00:00:10.520> you<00:00:10.790> know<00:00:10.910> exciting

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
the table something you know exciting

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.789 
the table something you know exciting
you<00:00:11.719> know<00:00:11.750> that<00:00:11.960> we've<00:00:12.049> never<00:00:12.170> done<00:00:12.260> before<00:00:12.410> is

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
you know that we've never done before is

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.470 
you know that we've never done before is
always<00:00:13.070> there<00:00:13.280> but<00:00:13.519> I<00:00:13.730> think<00:00:14.030> because<00:00:14.150> of<00:00:14.420> our

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
always there but I think because of our

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.290 
always there but I think because of our
fans<00:00:14.780> they<00:00:15.050> allow<00:00:15.290> us<00:00:15.500> to<00:00:15.860> add<00:00:16.580> those<00:00:17.060> things

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
fans they allow us to add those things

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.150 
fans they allow us to add those things
and<00:00:17.450> do<00:00:17.599> those<00:00:17.750> things<00:00:18.050> that<00:00:18.260> typically<00:00:18.650> some

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
and do those things that typically some

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.679 
and do those things that typically some
bands<00:00:19.369> won't<00:00:19.580> be<00:00:19.670> able<00:00:19.790> to<00:00:19.939> do<00:00:20.390> which<00:00:20.660> is

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
bands won't be able to do which is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.320 
bands won't be able to do which is
really<00:00:20.990> cool<00:00:21.259> we<00:00:21.470> can<00:00:21.619> build<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.220> stage<00:00:22.400> as<00:00:22.580> 144

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
really cool we can build a stage as 144

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.359 
really cool we can build a stage as 144
feet<00:00:23.539> long<00:00:23.810> across<00:00:24.199> in<00:00:24.470> arena<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:24.980> be<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
feet long across in arena and be in the

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.950 
feet long across in arena and be in the
round<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:25.789> that<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.330> only<00:00:26.510> you<00:00:26.840> know<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
round so that the only you know the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.840 
round so that the only you know the
farthest<00:00:27.410> person<00:00:28.070> away<00:00:28.279> is<00:00:28.460> only<00:00:28.580> going<00:00:28.699> to<00:00:28.789> be

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
farthest person away is only going to be

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.090 
farthest person away is only going to be
about<00:00:28.880> 60<00:00:29.300> feet<00:00:29.330> away<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:30.470> makes<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:30.920> so

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
about 60 feet away so it makes it so

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.710 
about 60 feet away so it makes it so
much<00:00:31.160> easier<00:00:31.490> for<00:00:31.730> us<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.000> be<00:00:32.210> able<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.449> connect

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
much easier for us to be able to connect

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.479 
much easier for us to be able to connect
with<00:00:32.780> them<00:00:33.019> so<00:00:33.290> be<00:00:33.410> so<00:00:33.620> much<00:00:33.860> even<00:00:34.309> though<00:00:34.400> it's

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
with them so be so much even though it's

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.710 
with them so be so much even though it's
gonna<00:00:34.550> be<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:34.879> big<00:00:35.030> arena<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:35.480> going<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.660> be

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
gonna be in a big arena it's going to be

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.570 
gonna be in a big arena it's going to be
very<00:00:35.780> very<00:00:36.710> personal<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.280> every<00:00:37.460> single

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
very very personal to every single

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.369

you know record mall and pick our
favorites<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.260> we've<00:02:56.560> been<00:02:56.650> recording

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
favorites and so we've been recording

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.520 
favorites and so we've been recording
now<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.580> I'd<00:02:57.790> say<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.630> past<00:02:58.870> few<00:02:59.050> months<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
now for I'd say the past few months and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
now for I'd say the past few months and
we've<00:03:00.459> been<00:03:00.580> busy<00:03:00.730> with<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.000> television<00:03:01.239> show

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
so it's kind of harder to get it through

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.110 
so it's kind of harder to get it through
but<00:03:02.920> now<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.400> studio<00:03:03.940> at<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
make it but now fits so perfectly into

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.920 
make it but now fits so perfectly into
the<00:03:39.880> whole<00:03:40.060> scheme<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.360> things<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.840> are

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the whole scheme of things that are

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.870 
the whole scheme of things that are
happening<00:03:41.200> now<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.400> journey<00:03:42.610> has

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
happening now and so the journey has

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.370 
happening now and so the journey has
really<00:03:42.910> taken<00:03:43.299> us<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.750> new<00:03:43.930> place<00:03:44.110> we're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
really taken us to this new place we're

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.870 
really taken us to this new place we're
really<00:03:44.470> excited<00:03:44.590> for<00:03:44.920> everyone<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.160> hear<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.340 

think<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.000> balance<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.510> us<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:50.170> about

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
think the balance for us is just about

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.640 
think the balance for us is just about
being<00:03:51.130> able<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.940> know<00:03:52.030> really<00:03:52.500> sees<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
moments in the moments that we got to

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.250 
moments in the moments that we got to
play<00:03:55.209> with<00:03:55.299> Stevie<00:03:55.540> Wonder<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> grammys

disney channel it's really a lot like

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.980 
disney channel it's really a lot like
who<00:05:00.460> we<00:05:00.580> are<00:05:00.700> or<00:05:00.910> three<00:05:01.270> brothers<00:05:01.570> in<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.780> band
