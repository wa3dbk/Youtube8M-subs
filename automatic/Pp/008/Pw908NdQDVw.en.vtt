00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
with it it was kind of like bit tricky

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
with it it was kind of like bit tricky
but<00:00:33.270> every<00:00:33.600> time<00:00:33.780> above<00:00:34.280> what<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> do

package<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.470> something<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> can

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
package or something like that you can

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
package or something like that you can
use<00:00:41.190> any<00:00:41.340> kill<00:00:41.550> shit<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.880> I<00:00:41.910> prefer<00:00:42.239> those

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
use any kill shit but I prefer those

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.270 
use any kill shit but I prefer those
ones<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.380> don't<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.100> pull

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
ones because you don't like really pull

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
ones because you don't like really pull
them<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.300> live

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
them out when you use them you just live

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
them out when you use them you just live
in<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.610> example<00:00:48.000> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
in two so this is like an example of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.220 
in two so this is like an example of
what<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.210> could<00:00:48.330> do<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.630> just<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
what you could do like a just like a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.370 
what you could do like a just like a
pistol<00:00:49.620> switch<00:00:50.330> just<00:00:51.330> use<00:00:51.540> your<00:00:51.570> wire<00:00:52.140> but

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
pistol switch just use your wire but

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.080 
pistol switch just use your wire but
it's<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.040> tough<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.490> you<00:00:53.580> do<00:00:53.700> it<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.880> normal

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
it's a bit tough if you do it the normal

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.570 
it's a bit tough if you do it the normal
way<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.330> this<00:00:54.600> way<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
way but this way you sort of get it

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.430 
way but this way you sort of get it
every<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.390> what<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.990> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.200> do<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
every time so what you want to do is you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
every time so what you want to do is you
want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> pretty<00:00:59.040> much<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.520> hit<00:00:59.790> right<00:01:00.390> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
want to pretty much just hit right on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.800 
want to pretty much just hit right on
the<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> d-pad<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.310> then<00:01:03.240> y<00:01:03.540> at<00:01:03.720> the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
the like the d-pad and then y at the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.410 
the like the d-pad and then y at the
same<00:01:03.990> time<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.129> killstreak<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.210> y

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
same time so the killstreak and then y

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
same time so the killstreak and then y
at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> exact<00:01:07.200> same<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.590> we've<00:01:07.740> heard<00:01:07.829> of<00:01:07.950> my

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
at the exact same time we've heard of my

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
at the exact same time we've heard of my
before<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> kill<00:01:08.880> streak<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> give

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
before the kill streak and are you give

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
before the kill streak and are you give
this<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.979> animation<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this little animation like that and I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149 
this little animation like that and I
know<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.079> guys<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.649> sort<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> thinking

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
know you guys are like sort of thinking

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
know you guys are like sort of thinking
I<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.579> that<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.119> do<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.509> fast<00:01:15.600> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I can do that if I do it really fast but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649 
I can do that if I do it really fast but
you<00:01:16.649> can<00:01:16.770> also<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.659> other

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you can also do it with like other

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
you can also do it with like other
classes<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> pistol<00:01:20.190> and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
it's not very known fast and you can do

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.680 
it's not very known fast and you can do
it<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.250> any<00:01:23.460> other<00:01:23.670> class<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> really

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
it with any other class that you really

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.930 
it with any other class that you really
want<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.620> could<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> new<00:01:26.610> wire

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
want to you could like a new wire

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.850 
want to you could like a new wire
animation<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.659> every<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.320> try<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.830> just

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
like the slack fly shot instead of the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
like the slack fly shot instead of the
normal<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.979> like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
normal way I like to do this one like

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.190 
this
just<00:01:51.890> looks<00:01:52.070> really<00:01:52.520> cool<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:53.869> really

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
just looks really cool and it's really

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.570 
just looks really cool and it's really
easy<00:01:54.350> because<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.920> would<00:01:55.100> have<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.549> hit

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
easy because you would have to do is hit

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.960 
easy because you would have to do is hit
left<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.210> why<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.330> write<00:01:57.260> my<00:01:57.290> butt<00:01:57.860> up<00:01:58.010> this<00:01:58.850> is

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
left and why I write my butt up this is

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.370 
left and why I write my butt up this is
like<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.270> normal<00:01:59.450> way<00:01:59.690> out<00:01:59.750> do<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> normal

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
like the normal way out do it the normal

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.060 
like the normal way out do it the normal
while<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:00.800> lay<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.130> now<00:02:02.290> new<00:02:03.290> why<00:02:03.470> way<00:02:03.680> so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
while I lay of it now new why way so

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.410 
while I lay of it now new why way so
sort<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.000> like<00:02:05.090> this<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.909> sort<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.239> does<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
sort of like this it sort of does a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.300 
sort of like this it sort of does a
different<00:02:08.899> way<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.500> looks<00:02:09.649> really<00:02:10.009> cool<00:02:10.280> i

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
different way and it looks really cool i

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.760 
different way and it looks really cool i
think<00:02:10.670> that's<00:02:10.819> looks<00:02:11.750> better<00:02:11.989> than<00:02:12.140> normal<00:02:12.260> i

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
think that's looks better than normal i

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.120 
think that's looks better than normal i
anyway<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:14.000> um<00:02:14.350> check<00:02:15.350> out<00:02:15.500> how<00:02:15.650> fast<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.100> can

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
anyway but um check out how fast you can

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.860 
anyway but um check out how fast you can
shoot<00:02:16.640> straight<00:02:17.060> after<00:02:17.420> you've<00:02:17.569> done<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
shoot straight after you've done it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.660 
shoot straight after you've done it
that's<00:02:18.680> especially<00:02:18.950> after<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.640> a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's especially after just like a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.699 
that's especially after just like a
weapon<00:02:20.030> switch<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.810> shoot<00:02:21.020> pretty<00:02:21.260> much<00:02:21.440> as

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
weapon switch I can shoot pretty much as

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.170 
weapon switch I can shoot pretty much as
soon<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:22.040> I've<00:02:22.130> switched<00:02:22.400> after<00:02:22.790> I've<00:02:22.880> done<00:02:23.000> it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
soon as I've switched after I've done it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.290 
soon as I've switched after I've done it
and<00:02:24.019> like<00:02:24.590> it's<00:02:24.769> bigger<00:02:25.340> than<00:02:25.430> its<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.880> swamp<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and like it's bigger than its a swamp I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.479 
and like it's bigger than its a swamp I
think<00:02:26.860> yeah<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.100> pretty<00:02:28.220> cool<00:02:28.459> shot

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
think yeah it's a pretty cool shot

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.880 
think yeah it's a pretty cool shot
because<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.239> due<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.019> white<00:02:30.260> wisin<00:02:30.680> one

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
because I think due to white wisin one

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.770 
because I think due to white wisin one
sniper<00:02:31.220> like<00:02:31.519> when<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> ever<00:02:32.570> do<00:02:32.750> that
