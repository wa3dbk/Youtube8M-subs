and<00:01:38.549> Matt<00:01:38.820> color<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.270> okay<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> what

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and Matt color this time okay so what

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.310 
and Matt color this time okay so what
you<00:01:42.509> could<00:01:42.630> speed<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.020> these<00:01:43.350> selections<00:01:45.320> and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you could speed up these selections and

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.120 
you could speed up these selections and
I<00:01:46.469> like<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:48.380> little<00:01:49.380> bit<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.679> can<00:01:49.799> press

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I like it a little bit you can press

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
I like it a little bit you can press
downwards<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> same<00:01:50.880> time

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
downwards at the same time

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
downwards at the same time
so<00:01:52.140> we're<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> knit<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.649> dark<00:01:52.890> red

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
so we're going to knit with dark red

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
so we're going to knit with dark red
primer<00:01:53.520> color<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.179> then<00:01:54.420> let's<00:01:54.659> see<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:54.929> we

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.940 
primer color and then let's see what we
get<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> secondary<00:01:55.799> color<00:01:58.789> classic<00:02:00.860> now<00:02:01.860> is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
get for a secondary color classic now is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.719 
get for a secondary color classic now is
it<00:02:02.039> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.280> something<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
