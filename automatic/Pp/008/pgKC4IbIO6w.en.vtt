on the thing on the flash board excuse
me<00:02:20.730> now<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.000> charged<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.440> look<00:02:23.560> in

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
me now that it's charged you can look in

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.260 
me now that it's charged you can look in
there<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> battery<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:25.150> will

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
there and take out the battery that will

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.580 
there and take out the battery that will
keep<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.540> from<00:02:25.570> recharging<00:02:26.380> once<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.160> flashes

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
keep you from recharging once it flashes

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.810 
keep you from recharging once it flashes
now<00:02:29.610> taking<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.640> knife<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.230> pick<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.260> up<00:02:32.440> and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
now taking the knife I pick it up and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.860 
now taking the knife I pick it up and
instead<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.970> discharging<00:02:34.510> across<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
instead of discharging across the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
instead of discharging across the
capacitor<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:36.000> set<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.620> clicker<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
capacitor I set the clicker so that it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.420 
capacitor I set the clicker so that it
will<00:02:40.060> flash<00:02:40.570> when<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.290> press<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> button<00:02:44.430> there

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
will flash when I press the button there

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.910 
will flash when I press the button there
we<00:02:45.550> go<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.630> capacitor<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> discharged

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
we go now the capacitor is discharged

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.180 
we go now the capacitor is discharged
but<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.510> safe<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:50.020> also<00:02:50.590> discharge

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
but just to be safe I also discharge

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.140 
but just to be safe I also discharge
across<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.580> capacitor<00:02:52.000> leads<00:02:53.940> there<00:02:54.940> could

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
across the capacitor leads there could

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.500 
across the capacitor leads there could
still<00:02:55.180> be<00:02:55.450> some<00:02:55.810> high<00:02:55.989> voltage<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.530> there

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
still be some high voltage in there

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.820 
still be some high voltage in there
there<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.630> go<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.380> see<00:02:59.530> them<00:02:59.650> more

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
there you go now you can see them more

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.550 
there you go now you can see them more
closely<00:03:00.040> oh<00:03:00.630> there<00:03:01.630> was<00:03:01.780> some<00:03:01.989> charge<00:03:02.260> thank

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
closely oh there was some charge thank

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.860 
closely oh there was some charge thank
goodness<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.040> checked<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.000 

okay<00:03:10.870> you'll<00:03:11.079> notice<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:11.439> it<00:03:11.650> doesn't<00:03:11.860> come

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
okay you'll notice that it doesn't come

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.429 
okay you'll notice that it doesn't come
out<00:03:12.099> right<00:03:12.340> away<00:03:12.689> so<00:03:13.689> you<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> take<00:03:14.140> apart

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
out right away so you have to take apart

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.619 
out right away so you have to take apart
part<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:14.980> aperture<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.480> is

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
part of the aperture because it is

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.179 
part of the aperture because it is
spring-loaded<00:03:16.930> mechanism<00:03:17.319> in<00:03:17.739> there<00:03:17.920> that

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
spring-loaded mechanism in there that

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.960 
spring-loaded mechanism in there that
triggers<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.549> flash<00:03:18.849> unit<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> taking<00:03:21.700> off<00:03:21.819> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
triggers a flash unit now taking off the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.940 
triggers a flash unit now taking off the
spring<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:23.500> frees<00:03:23.799> up<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:23.980> flash<00:03:24.250> unit<00:03:28.950> as

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
spring that frees up the flash unit as

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.670 
spring that frees up the flash unit as
you<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.519> see<00:03:30.760> on<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.689> spring<00:03:31.959> comes<00:03:32.170> off<00:03:32.379> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
you can see on the spring comes off the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.390 
you can see on the spring comes off the
unit<00:03:33.310> comes<00:03:33.519> out<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.909> easily<00:03:38.129> there<00:03:39.129> we<00:03:39.280> go

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
unit comes out very easily there we go

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.820 
unit comes out very easily there we go
there's<00:03:39.849> your<00:03:39.939> flash<00:03:40.209> unit

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.980 

okay<00:03:49.640> now<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.150> some<00:03:50.420> interesting<00:03:50.660> things

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
okay now on to some interesting things

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.390 
okay now on to some interesting things
you<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.290> do<00:03:51.410> with<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:52.810> there's<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:54.020> back<00:03:54.400> now

the pitch of the the wine levels out on

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.370 
the pitch of the the wine levels out on
this<00:04:22.940> telling<00:04:23.540> me<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.840> capacitor<00:04:24.290> is

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
this telling me that the capacitor is

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.820 
this telling me that the capacitor is
charged<00:04:24.830> now<00:04:25.270> i'm<00:04:26.270> using<00:04:27.050> my<00:04:27.080> pen<00:04:27.410> to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
charged now i'm using my pen to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.190 
charged now i'm using my pen to
discharge<00:04:28.280> across<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.670> capacitor<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:30.050> can

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
discharge across the capacitor you can

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.200 
discharge across the capacitor you can
see<00:04:30.380> what<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> big<00:04:30.740> flash<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.160> us<00:04:31.340> it's<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.820> lot<00:04:32.030> of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
see what a big flash of us it's a lot of

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.530 
see what a big flash of us it's a lot of
energy<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.860> this<00:04:34.640> board<00:04:34.970> automatically

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
energy and this board automatically

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.840 
energy and this board automatically
recharged<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.710> pop<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.130> battery<00:04:37.250> out<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:37.820> I

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
recharged so I pop the battery out so I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.070 
recharged so I pop the battery out so I
could<00:04:37.970> discharge<00:04:38.240> again<00:04:38.690> without<00:04:38.840> it

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
could discharge again without it

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.950 
could discharge again without it
recharging<00:04:40.360> there<00:04:41.360> we<00:04:41.480> go<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.900> discharged
