 she's better than Bulgarian she's pot-bellied 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.110
 Maikop barrel this is how it looks 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.010
 it means we order barrels without cranes 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.200
 so there is no road bumps here is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.840

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.720

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.920

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:02.120
 10-meter these two barrels mayakovsky 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:08.510
 this barrel is Moldavian dear friends 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:12.540
 50 meter Moldavian barrel , 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:17.120
 stainless steel for this barrel look 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.760
 he looks like this is professional 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.860
 professional stainless steel tap 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:31.280
 so a turn from here flows 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:36.960
 twists here it closes does not flow 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:42.180
 wine means service hole twists 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.150
 the faucet is food grade stainless steel screen 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.510
 big for big drums there 50 liters 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.130
 more than 6 liter have the same quran and 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.780
 smaller barrels 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.030
 smaller volume is real 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.639
 professional him that's what they like 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.680
 should look like real taps from 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.650
 food stainless steel here they are expensive 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.139
 here's friends have seen this somewhere 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.530
 I do not know not seen but here we have it 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:20.330
 please open the real tap here 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.330
 he is this inside 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:34.090
 close closed 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:38.800
 nothing flows and so 1 bag add 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:42.099
 long then fold this wooden crane 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.090
 which is sold in our store here 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:53.620

00:05:46.090 --> 00:06:00.400
 this is about my vasche me like he 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:14.860
 such a tap is open closed but so 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:17.379
 all the barrels work we are without cranes and without 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.560
 respectively here without these holes 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:24.389
 we will sell because the crane and it 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:30.159
 so to speak an accessory for an amateur 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:32.259
 an accessory for an amateur, so who needs 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:37.349
 he misses means to drill 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:41.050
 they â€™ll order a hole for a tap or something like that 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:43.150
 please but for big barrels of course 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.020
 I need a crane I would recommend with 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:50.710
 food stainless steel 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:54.520
 but for ten-liter barrels I don't know 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:07:02.050
 it may not even be necessary to be such 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:04.870
 traffic jams in Mayakovsky barrels but either here 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.610
