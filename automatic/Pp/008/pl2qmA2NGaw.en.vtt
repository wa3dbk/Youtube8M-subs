and I'll be using red abalone pants so
why<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.290> get<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.239> turn<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
why don't we get going and turn the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
why don't we get going and turn the
machine<00:00:51.630> on<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.079> you'll<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.400> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
machine on and you'll see how the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.990 
machine on and you'll see how the
modification<00:00:54.180> affects<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.620> overall

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
modification affects the overall

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 

and<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.830> getting

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and all right I'm kind of getting

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
and all right I'm kind of getting
everything<00:01:11.520> adjusted<00:01:16.280> turn<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> water

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.050 

get<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> nice<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.650> nice<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> away<00:01:32.010> no<00:01:32.790> such

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
get it nice and nice and away no such

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
get it nice and nice and away no such
thing<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.720> well<00:01:33.990> being<00:01:34.229> too<00:01:34.890> wet<00:01:36.620> all<00:01:37.620> right

and away we go

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:51.770 
and away we go
we'll<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.760> turns<00:01:38.970> machine<00:01:39.060> on

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.560 

right<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.640> bonus<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.150> turning<00:01:54.420> in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
right now the bonus are all turning in

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.250 
right now the bonus are all turning in
the<00:01:54.660> same<00:01:54.690> direction<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.440> will<00:01:55.980> now<00:01:57.020> turn<00:01:58.020> on

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
the same direction I will now turn on

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.290 
the same direction I will now turn on
the<00:01:58.290> circuit<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.340> designed<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.060> you'll

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
the circuit that I designed and you'll

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.730 
the circuit that I designed and you'll
see<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:01.650> impact<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> oscillation

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
see the impact it has on the oscillation

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.949 
see the impact it has on the oscillation
of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> volleyball

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.289 

right<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.680> process<00:02:13.069> has<00:02:13.280> become<00:02:13.489> I'm<00:02:13.939> going

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
right the process has become I'm going

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.449 
right the process has become I'm going
to<00:02:14.569> zoom<00:02:14.719> in<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:16.040> make<00:02:16.159> it<00:02:16.219> a<00:02:16.370> little

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
to zoom in on this to make it a little

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:54.090 
to zoom in on this to make it a little
bit<00:02:16.640> easier<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.239> say

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.430 

motor<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.880> was<00:02:55.270> turning<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.050> right<00:02:56.200> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
motor a was turning to the right a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.470 
motor a was turning to the right a
moment<00:02:56.770> ago<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.130> then<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.730> we<00:02:57.850> have<00:02:58.000> motor<00:02:58.240> B

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
moment ago and then that we have motor B

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:12.790 
moment ago and then that we have motor B
which<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:58.960> changed<00:02:59.290> direction

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.840 

right<00:03:13.400> now<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.610> motors<00:03:14.060> are<00:03:15.490> programmed<00:03:16.490> to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
right now the motors are programmed to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.090 
right now the motors are programmed to
change<00:03:17.570> directions<00:03:18.610> at<00:03:19.610> about<00:03:19.940> 18<00:03:20.660> seconds<00:03:21.170> or

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
change directions at about 18 seconds or

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.780 
change directions at about 18 seconds or
18<00:03:22.460> second<00:03:22.760> intervals

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.390 

and<00:03:30.299> shortly<00:03:30.689> you'll<00:03:30.840> see<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:32.040> ball<00:03:32.220> change

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
and shortly you'll see the ball change

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.920 
and shortly you'll see the ball change
direction<00:03:32.700> again<00:03:32.909> which<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.360> has<00:03:33.599> that's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
direction again which it just has that's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.640 
direction again which it just has that's
because<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.790> motor<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> corner<00:03:36.530> which<00:03:37.530> is

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
because the motor in the corner which is

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.530 
because the motor in the corner which is
out<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:38.010> view<00:03:38.459> right<00:03:38.670> now<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:39.239> changed

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
out of view right now it just changed

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.430 
out of view right now it just changed
direction

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.310 

and<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.070> is<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.510> continual<00:03:46.510> continual

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
and this is a continual continual

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.470 
and this is a continual continual
looping<00:03:48.420> process<00:03:50.940> right<00:03:51.940> now<00:03:52.060> all<00:03:52.240> three

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
looping process right now all three

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.480 
looping process right now all three
motors<00:03:52.750> are<00:03:52.870> turning<00:03:53.110> in<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.290> same<00:03:53.470> direction

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.820 

and<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.180> interval<00:04:00.600> which<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.470> happens<00:04:01.770> to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and the interval which just happens to

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.490 
and the interval which just happens to
be<00:04:01.920> 18<00:04:02.340> seconds<00:04:02.790> no<00:04:03.210> apparent<00:04:03.660> reason<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:04.260> can

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
be 18 seconds no apparent reason it can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:18.840 
be 18 seconds no apparent reason it can
it<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:04.890> adjustable<00:04:06.590> up<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.770> one<00:04:07.950> minute

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.910 

so<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.690> see<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:21.220> benefits<00:04:21.640> of<00:04:21.790> having

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
so as you can see the benefits of having

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:30.429 
so as you can see the benefits of having
three<00:04:23.920> motors<00:04:24.250> involved<00:04:24.820> in<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.090> process

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:30.439 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:43.840 

for<00:04:31.069> changing<00:04:31.459> ball<00:04:31.610> direction

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.030 

we<00:04:44.360> have<00:04:44.540> not<00:04:44.720> just<00:04:45.020> one<00:04:45.320> mode<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.650> change<00:04:45.860> in

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
we have not just one mode of change in

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.010 
we have not just one mode of change in
direction<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.640> ball<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.120> all<00:04:47.390> three<00:04:47.780> get

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
direction of the ball but all three get

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.879 
direction of the ball but all three get
involved

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.619 

ensuring<00:04:54.819> that<00:04:54.879> we're<00:04:55.120> covering<00:04:55.419> all

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
ensuring that we're covering all

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:02.220 
ensuring that we're covering all
services<00:04:56.289> of<00:04:56.439> the<00:04:56.650> ball

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.690 

there<00:05:03.230> now<00:05:03.380> all<00:05:03.560> three<00:05:03.860> motors<00:05:04.160> turning<00:05:04.520> in

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
there now all three motors turning in

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:37.690 
there now all three motors turning in
the<00:05:04.790> same<00:05:04.970> direction<00:05:05.120> again

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.640
