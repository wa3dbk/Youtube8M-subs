t3i which is also known as the canon
600d<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.600> believe<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> international

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070

600d I believe in the international
markets<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.449> chose<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.719> camera<00:00:58.230> for

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
markets and I chose this camera for

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
markets and I chose this camera for
several<00:00:58.800> reasons<00:00:58.949> there<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.370> many<00:00:59.730> other

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
several reasons there are many other

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
several reasons there are many other
options<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> couple

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
options out there but there are a couple

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
options out there but there are a couple
of<00:01:01.800> reasons<00:01:01.980> why<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> chose<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:02.969> i<00:01:03.420> actually

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
of reasons why I chose this i actually

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
of reasons why I chose this i actually
bought<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> camera<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.670> t5<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.450> was

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bought this camera when the t5 i was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.840 
bought this camera when the t5 i was
already<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.220> generations

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
already out which is two generations

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
already out which is two generations
above<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> reason<00:01:10.110> why<00:01:10.380> i<00:01:10.409> chose<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
above it but the reason why i chose this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.460 
above it but the reason why i chose this
over<00:01:11.430> even<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> newer<00:01:12.180> t5i<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.200> something

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
over even the newer t5i or something

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
over even the newer t5i or something
like<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> 60<00:01:14.040> d<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.509> actually

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
like a 60 d is because this actually

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.370 
like a 60 d is because this actually
shares<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:16.560> sensor<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.479> t5<00:01:18.479> i<00:01:18.689> but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
shares the same sensor as the t5 i but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.580 
shares the same sensor as the t5 i but
it's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.860> cheaper<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:21.090> does<00:01:21.479> lack<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.110> few

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's a lot cheaper it does lack a few

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.030 
it's a lot cheaper it does lack a few
features<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> t5<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> has<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.590> has<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
features that the t5 I has but it has a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
features that the t5 I has but it has a
couple<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.430> features<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.299> need<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
couple of features which I do need and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
couple of features which I do need and
those<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.979> driving<00:01:29.790> features

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
those are really the driving features

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.899 
those are really the driving features
behind<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.350> videos<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.400> first<00:01:32.640> one<00:01:32.880> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
behind these videos and the first one is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.109 
behind these videos and the first one is
the<00:01:33.210> flip<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.750> LCD<00:01:34.650> screen<00:01:35.000> when<00:01:36.000> you're

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the flip out LCD screen when you're

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
the flip out LCD screen when you're
making<00:01:36.420> videos<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.500> own<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
making videos like this on your own and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
making videos like this on your own and
you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.610> you're<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> only<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.360> producing

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you know you're the only one producing

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.630 
you know you're the only one producing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
why this monitor this LCD screen is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.440 
why this monitor this LCD screen is
valuable<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.830> me<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.640> second<00:02:33.000> reason<00:02:33.120> why<00:02:33.420> i

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
valuable to me the second reason why i

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.900 
valuable to me the second reason why i
chose<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.990> t3i<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.530> because<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.130> has<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.550> mic

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
chose the t3i is because it has a mic

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.940 
chose the t3i is because it has a mic
input<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.020> want<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
input you're going to want to have a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.280 
input you're going to want to have a
camera<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> mic<00:02:39.270> input<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.140> can

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
camera with a mic input so that you can

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.650 
camera with a mic input so that you can
plug<00:02:40.500> something<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.400> into<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
plug something like this into it and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.960 
plug something like this into it and
i'll<00:02:42.930> go<00:02:43.110> into<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.740> actual<00:02:44.040> audio<00:02:44.490> equipment

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
i'll go into the actual audio equipment

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.050 
i'll go into the actual audio equipment
that<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.240> use<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.160> next<00:02:47.490> video<00:02:47.790> but

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that I use in in the next video but

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.600 
that I use in in the next video but
basically<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.690> want<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.800> able<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.160> send<00:02:50.430> my

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
basically I want to be able to send my

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.570 
basically I want to be able to send my
audio<00:02:50.990> straight<00:02:51.990> into<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.440> camera<00:02:52.770> which

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
audio straight into the camera which

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.640 
audio straight into the camera which
according<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.360> some<00:02:54.540> people<00:02:54.870> isn't<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> best

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
according to some people isn't the best

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350 
according to some people isn't the best
way<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.340> won't<00:02:56.460> get<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> cleanest

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
way to do it you won't get the cleanest

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
way to do it you won't get the cleanest
sound<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.530> cuts<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.070> step<00:02:59.400> out<00:02:59.580> of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
sound but it cuts that step out of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.540 
sound but it cuts that step out of
having<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.540> sync<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:00.990> audio<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.710> your<00:03:02.280> video

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
having to sync your audio and your video

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.370 
having to sync your audio and your video
later<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.090> which<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.570> good<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.230> you're

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
later on which is good for when you're

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.350 
later on which is good for when you're
making<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.860> lot<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.130> videos<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.760> want<00:03:05.970> to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
making a lot of videos and you want to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.690 
making a lot of videos and you want to
have<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.780> smooth<00:03:07.260> workflow<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:08.280> nice<00:03:08.520> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
have very smooth workflow it's nice to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.970 
have very smooth workflow it's nice to
have<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.060> audio<00:03:09.420> go<00:03:09.930> straight<00:03:10.350> into<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
have the audio go straight into the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.880 
have the audio go straight into the
camera<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.060> those<00:03:12.240> are<00:03:12.270> really<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.690> two<00:03:12.890> main

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
camera so those are really the two main

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.560 
camera so those are really the two main
features<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.490> i<00:03:14.550> use<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:15.330> camera

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
features that i use on this camera

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.600 
features that i use on this camera
itself<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> reason<00:03:16.500> why<00:03:16.890> i<00:03:16.920> use<00:03:17.430> it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
itself and it's the reason why i use it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.630 
itself and it's the reason why i use it
over<00:03:18.080> my<00:03:19.080> older<00:03:19.470> full-frame<00:03:19.860> camera<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.310> 5d

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
over my older full-frame camera the 5d

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.970 
over my older full-frame camera the 5d
mark<00:03:20.880> two<00:03:20.940> or<00:03:21.270> even<00:03:21.660> this<00:03:21.780> new<00:03:22.020> or<00:03:22.170> 60<00:03:22.650> which<00:03:22.830> i

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
mark two or even this new or 60 which i

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
mark two or even this new or 60 which i
have<00:03:23.160> here<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.520> back<00:03:23.700> i'll<00:03:24.090> probably<00:03:24.630> keep

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
have here in the back i'll probably keep

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.980 
have here in the back i'll probably keep
using<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.709> Canon<00:03:26.100> Rebel<00:03:26.250> t3i<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.780> these

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
using the Canon Rebel t3i for these

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.020 
using the Canon Rebel t3i for these
features<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.770> has<00:03:28.800> over<00:03:29.190> those<00:03:29.490> cameras

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
features that it has over those cameras

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.140 
features that it has over those cameras
even<00:03:30.390> though<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.130> output<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.340> terms<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.760> video

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
even though the output in terms of video

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.970 
even though the output in terms of video
might<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.690> actually<00:03:33.930> better<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.650> some<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
might be actually better and some of the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
might be actually better and some of the
other<00:03:35.160> cameras<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.730> there<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.900> course<00:03:37.290> there

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
other cameras out there of course there

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
other cameras out there of course there
are<00:03:37.500> other<00:03:37.620> cameras<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.490> use<00:03:38.760> you

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
are other cameras that you can use you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
are other cameras that you can use you
can<00:03:39.150> start<00:03:39.390> off<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> nice<00:03:39.990> point<00:03:40.350> and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
can start off with a nice point and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.230 
can start off with a nice point and
shoot<00:03:40.800> which<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.490> something<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> actually

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
shoot which is something that I actually

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.360 
shoot which is something that I actually
did<00:03:42.600> in<00:03:42.750> my<00:03:42.840> older<00:03:43.200> channel<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.160> use<00:03:44.340> a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
did in my older channel you can use a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.940 
did in my older channel you can use a
smartphone<00:03:44.880> camera<00:03:45.420> like<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:45.600> your<00:03:46.560> iPhone

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
smartphone camera like this your iPhone

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.830 
smartphone camera like this your iPhone
your<00:03:46.980> Android<00:03:47.310> phone<00:03:47.700> whatever<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.360> may<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.510> as

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
your Android phone whatever it may be as

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.320 
your Android phone whatever it may be as
long<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.310> get<00:03:50.520> good<00:03:50.730> lighting<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.240> I

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
long as you get good lighting which I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.180 
long as you get good lighting which I
will<00:03:51.480> talk<00:03:51.510> about<00:03:51.840> in<00:03:52.080> another<00:03:52.320> video<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.070> in

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
will talk about in another video so in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.790 
will talk about in another video so in
terms<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.520> lenses<00:03:54.030> there<00:03:54.420> are<00:03:54.630> many<00:03:55.410> different

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
terms of lenses there are many different

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.650 
terms of lenses there are many different
options<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.430> can<00:03:56.610> use<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.270> get<00:03:57.480> different

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
options you can use to get different

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.320 
options you can use to get different
looks<00:03:58.080> but<00:03:58.830> for<00:03:59.100> me<00:03:59.250> specifically<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.940> actually

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
looks but for me specifically I actually

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.230 
looks but for me specifically I actually
like<00:04:00.690> using<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.290> wider<00:04:01.620> angle<00:04:01.920> lens<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:03.209> lens

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
like using a wider angle lens the lens

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.090 
like using a wider angle lens the lens
that<00:04:03.600> i'm<00:04:03.750> using<00:04:03.800> specifically<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:04.920> the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that i'm using specifically is the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.150 
that i'm using specifically is the
rokinon<00:04:05.580> 14<00:04:06.180> millimeter<00:04:06.660> which<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> crop

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
rokinon 14 millimeter which is on a crop

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.850 
rokinon 14 millimeter which is on a crop
sensor<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.120> around<00:04:09.480> 8<00:04:09.720> 21<00:04:10.230> or<00:04:10.500> 22

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
sensor like this it's around 8 21 or 22

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.250 
sensor like this it's around 8 21 or 22
equivalent<00:04:11.580> focal<00:04:11.730> length<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.270> terms<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.840> 35

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
equivalent focal length in terms of 35

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.470 
equivalent focal length in terms of 35
millimeter<00:04:13.709> format<00:04:14.190> which<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:14.790> fairly<00:04:15.180> wide

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
millimeter format which is fairly wide

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.539 
millimeter format which is fairly wide
it's<00:04:15.660> not<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:16.020> you'd<00:04:16.169> call<00:04:16.520> ultralight<00:04:17.520> I

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
it's not what you'd call ultralight I

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.909 
it's not what you'd call ultralight I
guess<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.270> wide-angle<00:04:18.919> perspective

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
guess but it is a wide-angle perspective

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.890 
guess but it is a wide-angle perspective
and<00:04:20.130> again<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.669> like<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.330> wide<00:04:21.600> angle

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and again I like this wide angle

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.040 
and again I like this wide angle
perspective<00:04:22.620> because<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.430> helps<00:04:23.700> me<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:23.910> lot

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
perspective because it helps me a lot

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.420 
perspective because it helps me a lot
doing<00:04:25.050> these<00:04:25.200> productions<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:25.919> my<00:04:26.100> own<00:04:26.250> so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
doing these productions on my own so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
doing these productions on my own so
again<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.790> can<00:04:26.940> reach<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
again I can reach the

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.990 
again I can reach the
lens<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.380> focus<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.860> if<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.070> want<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.700> can

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
lens I can focus it if I want to I can

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.600 
lens I can focus it if I want to I can
reach<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.570> camera<00:04:30.930> press<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.320> play<00:04:31.500> button

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
reach the camera press the play button

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.760 
reach the camera press the play button
look<00:04:32.610> at<00:04:32.730> my<00:04:32.850> audio<00:04:33.270> do<00:04:33.900> everything<00:04:34.470> straight

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
look at my audio do everything straight

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.800 
look at my audio do everything straight
from<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.040> camera<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:36.030> wide<00:04:36.240> angle<00:04:36.480> lens

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
from this camera and a wide angle lens

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.170 
from this camera and a wide angle lens
allows<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.770> do<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.130> now<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.670> reason<00:04:38.910> why

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
allows you to do that now the reason why

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.270 
allows you to do that now the reason why
I<00:04:39.210> have<00:04:39.510> their<00:04:39.690> rokinon<00:04:40.110> 14<00:04:40.620> millimeter<00:04:41.070> lens

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
I have their rokinon 14 millimeter lens

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.730 
I have their rokinon 14 millimeter lens
is<00:04:41.550> because<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.150> does<00:04:42.360> not<00:04:42.390> just<00:04:42.930> work<00:04:43.170> on<00:04:43.380> crop

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
is because it does not just work on crop

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070 
is because it does not just work on crop
sensor<00:04:43.950> cameras<00:04:44.550> like<00:04:44.700> this<00:04:44.850> t3i<00:04:45.300> it<00:04:45.960> will

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
sensor cameras like this t3i it will

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.320 
sensor cameras like this t3i it will
actually<00:04:46.260> work<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.710> my<00:04:46.890> full<00:04:47.130> frame<00:04:47.310> camera<00:04:47.760> so

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
actually work on my full frame camera so

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.990 
actually work on my full frame camera so
I<00:04:48.360> can<00:04:48.690> basically<00:04:49.320> pull<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:49.920> lens<00:04:50.460> off<00:04:50.670> and

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
I can basically pull this lens off and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.850 
I can basically pull this lens off and
then<00:04:51.210> attached<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.510> my<00:04:51.870> 6d<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.410> it's<00:04:52.530> going<00:04:52.740> to

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
then attached to my 6d and it's going to

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.650 
then attached to my 6d and it's going to
work<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.040> fine<00:04:53.610> if<00:04:53.910> you're<00:04:54.150> committed<00:04:54.630> to

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
work just fine if you're committed to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.110 
work just fine if you're committed to
the<00:04:54.930> crop<00:04:55.260> sensor<00:04:55.530> like<00:04:55.980> on<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.160> t3i<00:04:56.700> or

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
the crop sensor like on a t3i or

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
pick up a lens called the tokina 11 to

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.030 
pick up a lens called the tokina 11 to
16<00:05:08.010> f<00:05:08.310> 2.8<00:05:08.630> which<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:09.780> probably<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.380> best<00:05:10.650> wide

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
16 f 2.8 which is probably the best wide

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.520 
16 f 2.8 which is probably the best wide

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
angle zoom lens that you can get for the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.010 
angle zoom lens that you can get for the
aps-c<00:05:13.950> size<00:05:14.340> sensor<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:15.540> reason<00:05:15.870> why<00:05:15.990> I

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
aps-c size sensor the reason why I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.530 
aps-c size sensor the reason why I
didn't<00:05:16.500> get<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.680> was<00:05:17.130> again<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.820> lens<00:05:18.150> does

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
didn't get that was again that lens does

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.870 
didn't get that was again that lens does
not<00:05:18.750> work<00:05:18.960> on<00:05:19.080> full<00:05:19.410> frame<00:05:19.440> cameras<00:05:20.160> fully

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
not work on full frame cameras fully

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.750 
not work on full frame cameras fully
like<00:05:21.300> this<00:05:21.570> one<00:05:21.810> will<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.770> because<00:05:23.400> I'm<00:05:23.550> using

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
like this one will so because I'm using

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.820 
like this one will so because I'm using
two<00:05:24.090> different<00:05:24.420> systems<00:05:24.660> this<00:05:25.260> lens<00:05:25.710> is

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
two different systems this lens is

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.580 
two different systems this lens is
better<00:05:26.070> for<00:05:26.280> me<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.150> general<00:05:27.420> that<00:05:28.200> lens

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
better for me but in general that lens

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.740 
better for me but in general that lens
the<00:05:28.800> tokina<00:05:29.160> 11-16<00:05:29.700> will<00:05:30.240> give<00:05:30.480> you<00:05:30.570> better

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
the tokina 11-16 will give you better

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.660 
the tokina 11-16 will give you better
images<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.500> think<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.920> hundred<00:05:32.160> dollars

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
images for I think a hundred dollars

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.330 
images for I think a hundred dollars
more<00:05:32.910> than<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.270> lens<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:34.040> it's<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.160> great

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
more than this lens and it's a great

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.010 
more than this lens and it's a great
lens<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:35.850> that's<00:05:36.060> something<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.690> want<00:05:36.960> to
