so<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> blade<00:00:48.809> actually<00:00:49.020> handicaps<00:00:49.710> this

shooting this video in a relatively well
it<00:01:10.380> room<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:11.100> hoping<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> would<00:01:11.760> draw<00:01:11.970> more

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it room I'm hoping it would draw more

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.080 
it room I'm hoping it would draw more
out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.380> brightness<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> color<00:01:14.670> shade

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
out of the brightness or the color shade

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.300 
out of the brightness or the color shade
differences<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.560> sabers<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
differences in these sabers but it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
differences in these sabers but it's
probably<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.729> capturing<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.509> colors<00:01:19.320> work

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
probably not capturing the colors work

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.710 
probably not capturing the colors work
very<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:19.920> either

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
very well either

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
very well either
let's<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:21.990> give<00:01:22.170> him<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> trial<00:01:22.700> check<00:01:23.700> out

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
let's let's give him a trial check out

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:53.160 
let's let's give him a trial check out
how<00:01:24.030> how<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.570> light<00:01:25.229> up

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:04.050 

I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.490> now<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.180> can<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.930> best<00:02:02.530> how<00:02:03.060> how

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
I think now you can see the best how how

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.270 
I think now you can see the best how how
the<00:02:04.119> Arctic<00:02:04.840> blue<00:02:05.049> creates<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.649> very<00:02:05.920> very

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
the Arctic blue creates a very very

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.180 
the Arctic blue creates a very very
beautiful<00:02:06.549> light<00:02:07.060> blue<00:02:07.090> color<00:02:07.689> it's<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.979> has<00:02:09.009> a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
beautiful light blue color it's it has a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.350 
beautiful light blue color it's it has a
small<00:02:10.030> hint<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.660> Zion<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:13.090> it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
small hint of of Zion in it but but it's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
small hint of of Zion in it but but it's
it's<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.900> much<00:02:14.080> better<00:02:14.290> than<00:02:14.530> any<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's it's much better than any of the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.199 
it's it's much better than any of the
silent<00:02:15.690> sign<00:02:16.690> LEDs<00:02:17.200> I've<00:02:17.470> seen<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.640> far<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
silent sign LEDs I've seen so far and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.140 
silent sign LEDs I've seen so far and
it's<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.410> very<00:02:20.500> bright<00:02:20.950> also<00:02:21.250> considering

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it's it's very bright also considering

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.290 
it's it's very bright also considering
