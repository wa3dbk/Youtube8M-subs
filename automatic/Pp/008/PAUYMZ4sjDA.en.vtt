 thanks later russia did not come addition 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.210
 match fluff and will not arise so 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.890
 the match 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.449
 such a wonderful crust that plays 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.899
 translated 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.759
 the box itself is very large 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.739
 inside the box it is 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.990
 treasure maps 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 and door cards 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 besides this is on the verge of a cube 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.820
 ha 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 like quite a lot 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 with the door card and more than 90 pieces 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.220
 they are advertising kan them are in 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.289
 the rules of the game 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.300
 but in our city and hail is common in 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.900
 not bad in principle 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.090
 but with us and more popular 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.800
 enjoy pochobuta 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.440
 scrub dollars 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.680
 monopoly and mafia 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.980
 but tempting a great future in what scrip 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.530
 essence uah 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.160
 as we see 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.250
 on the box 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 Unfortunately 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.070
 on the Russian edition is not written but it 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.310
 american edition in this regard 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 that the goal of the game is the monster matches 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.159
 on the one hand account and delivers friends 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.650
 This measure is a parody of 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
 English speaking destinations 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.220
 but in Russia it is still used very much 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.710
 in great demand and popularity with Igor 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.870
 sufficiently simple game mechanics 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.830
 The main goal of the game is the sale and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.640
 chile level ten 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.500
 prapor reached 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.700
 do not tell my ways this victory 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.260
 above monsters 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.050
 and so on and so forth like 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.510
 our game begins 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.999
 every player 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.029
 and stosur baikal g 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.339
 s gets a motive four cards 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.839
 two door pictures idea treasure map 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:22.919
 but everyone is watching 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.809
 what did you get him 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.229
 let's say in this case to us 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:30.819
 got caught 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.409
 map to morgue 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.959
 card a curse 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.499
 and map 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:38.969
 shoe 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.769
 and and greens 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.999
 we can not immediately lay out the second 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.739
 cards 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.700
 so where are the best players 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.410
 recall while playing his wife other 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.849
 or players for someone will 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.559
 counteract mix 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.459
 difficult level 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.079
 how do analysts say 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.649
 same time we had to defeat any 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.609
 cost well enough 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.369
 she has a lot of interesting 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:08.689
 translated into Russian 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.869
 additions in english not 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.869
 translated and the details are two or three more 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.469

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.189

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.929
 also kuldig rules 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.809
 and in principle, different versions of the munchkin can 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.659
 to connect 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.389
 and interesting enough for us to 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.789

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.150
 cost and the average difference from 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.849
 five hundred to seven hundred rubles 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.279
 but the pleasure that you get 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.919
 percentage this money purchase goal history 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.010
