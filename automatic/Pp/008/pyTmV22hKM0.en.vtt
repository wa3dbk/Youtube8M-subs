00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.280
 I'm electric again 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.820
 tactics and is it sunday evening me 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 believe so around the clock 24 just so and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.150
 I'm just just two prestige 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 so have been prestige twice 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 Button pressed and I thought that went 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 pretty fast on friday evening or 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 Saturday morning I'm practically one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 and now I have the whole 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.750
 day gambled on sunday and am prestige 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.199
 2 won it went pretty fast like 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.700
 I think 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.800
 and now i wanted to give you some tips 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.370
 give it as fast as you do 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.750
 I could see many people doing that 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 the cats around because a bit 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.820
 it's new cd outside most people 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.719
 quickly want to quickly level many 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.660
 Unlock things and stop too 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 prestige very many and I say 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 you guys today as fast as that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.480
 possible to reach the game mode 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.399
 and what setup you can use 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 Of course these are just tips you have to 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.910
 do not follow them and especially not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.790
 you can do that too 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 wants to leave as you want 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 In any case, we will start with 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.020
 the setup a weapon after your choice on 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.759
 best one with derek comes out well and 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 with which one is relatively variable yes as 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.860
 killstreaks definitely takes with the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.159
 drone hunter killer threaten and the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.170
 controller the hunter killer john the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 is not absolutely necessary for the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.799
 setup but you should not do anything higher 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 as the control takes with it 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.850
 ever said that because it is 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 therefore the control and the drone so 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 to reach as quickly as possible 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.200
 Of course that will help you too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.320
 hardliner so that even faster 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 and that can drive even more points 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.159
 namely if you have the drone and the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 counter drone up there you get 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 it was always said 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.290
 that is extremely helpful because firstly 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.390
 So you can reach your second one 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.820
 threatening again if you both have up 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.970
 then you do not get 20 points of cup 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.560
 so you are almost the whole time one 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.450
 killstreak flow and you have the whole 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.310
 time drone and contador without the above 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.900
 means the opponents do not see you and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.180
 you can easily make the opponents easy 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.260
 drive away 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.430
 that is very helpful and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.200
 if your hardliner 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 has reached thereby not only your 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.120
 not faster but you get 40 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.200
 points if I'm right 40 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.000
 points cups and that's a lot 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.100
 want to make the mails and gets 40 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.750
 points and of course you can reach that 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 also extremely fast again your next 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.519
 killstreak so now we come to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.220
 play mode not play here 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.680
 By the way, I'm playing here, I think 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.920
 At the end there is a team deathmatch 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.620
 with the m 8 1 a burst weapon a lot 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.840
 better is quite niger schnieke sneaker 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.959
 continue to setup now we come to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.299
 play mode the game mode in which he am 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.850
 Making most points is easy 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.319
 position 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.480
 It sounds weird it is 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.670
 There is no game mode where he is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.700
 most points brand I do with 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.489
 this setup what i just said in 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.000
 usually at least 5,000 points 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.299
 position 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.579
 sometimes even 7000 to 8000 points that 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.220
 I can manage that 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.019
 maximum if it is going really well 5000 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.380
 points and that's the minimum 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.680
 disfigurement which I almost always achieved 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.070
 and yes, because you get a new one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.630
 So this seems neutral 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.030
 you get 200 points if you have the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.220
 takes then you still makes then 1 km 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.989
 Do you have your year like an adversary? 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.579
 took the position and then 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.079
 back out of the position is so 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.769
 the position becomes neutral again and the 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.920
 take the 1 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.470
 you get back 200 points of the thing 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.030
 But if your team is the position 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.230
 has taken and then goes out and 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.850
 their one is almost back 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.639
 recaptured then you do not get any 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.810
 points but you can definitely wood 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.790
 take advantage of that are opponents can go out 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.290
 It may be a bit risky though 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.290
 sometimes it works pretty well 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.599
 It is so quiet that she takes a position 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.540
 war two points run out if you 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.220
 now maybe an opponent shoots 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.190
 the trend in the position but you 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.450
 does not see then let him run in 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.919
 takes the position kill him on the 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.230
 best and then you get two again 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.820
 points when taking so that's what you do 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.880
 makes points visa and then with 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.970
 the july as it is so on the level 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.250
 fastest because I mean the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.169
 Most want to level up and then like that 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.690
 go as fast as possible to the prestige 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.370
 Second, I rule the old one 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.510
 traditional rule now depends on you 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.250
 you would have that synonymous for normal 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.060
 life said only 5,000 tricks 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.450
 points there is true but rule goes 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.419
 something so if you have a good team one 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:03.850
 good feels a little faster over that 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:07.880
 the advantage is with spanish rule 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.130
 if your pad since and the straight 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.950
 takes and then kills someone 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.350
 you think I two r are 200 points 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.740
 that only makes 200 points with the 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.950
 for example, a twinkling of the 750 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.080
 points goes to a to b for example 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.600
 take it 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.090
 then you kill two while taking 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.860
 people are 400 points then next to the b 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.350
 10 200 points 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.479
 you already have 600 points then you have to 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.350
 kill another guy and it is 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.050
 get and train 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.570
 you have a lightning stroke so you can 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.370
 really extremely fast driving points 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.139
 and so I actually have the game 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.090
 mainly position and dominance 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.789
 and position is really fun though 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.070
 Reign is definitely better for his 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.639
 better to reach high killstreaks 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.720
 although you are in position even if you 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.190
 almost does not occupy the position 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.470
 but the position always flanked 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.780
 also build his kings relatively well 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.380
 So now I have a lot 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.620
 Gelabert we can collect points 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.840
 yes that 's it for the topic 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.160
 but I wanted you one more now 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.660
 little bit about how it now so on 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.640
 goes with black ops 2 I'm right 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.950
 makes me look thick in any case 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.650
 really fun 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.850
 the game has parma but I think so 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.740
 not so bad it makes me too 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:28.540
 Have fun and I will definitely 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.310
 near future couple classes guides make 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.100
 because I really have some cool classes on 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.070
 start as I have to tell you what the 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.250
 you can party your friends 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.470
 can build true that I will the 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.220
 Israel and I do not know when and 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.510
 as we have looked at each other before 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.610
 next, I also wanted a few more 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.790
 map &amp; guide because I have so many 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:55.150
 people still a bit around trees 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.470
 and then some tricks and stuff 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.310
 everything comes to mind 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:02.500
 that was before and at the electric co 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.150
 on the channel there is definitely one 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.440
 play on the xbox is definitely still 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.720
 few weapons guides so we'll look 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.650
 maybe it will change too 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.070
 that you are so people until the 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.070
 next time
