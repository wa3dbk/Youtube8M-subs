possible to maximize space in here and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.780 
possible to maximize space in here and
one<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.830> things<00:03:52.070> they've<00:03:52.340> done<00:03:52.580> is

one of the things they've done is

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.640 
one of the things they've done is
they've<00:03:53.030> actually<00:03:53.209> taken<00:03:53.570> this<00:03:53.900> rear<00:03:54.290> sway

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650

bar<00:03:54.920> out<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.340> car<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:56.019> while<00:03:57.019> that's<00:03:57.290> not

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
bar out of the car and while that's not

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.060 
bar out of the car and while that's not
great<00:03:57.980> from<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.459> handling<00:03:59.150> perspective<00:04:00.070> it

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
great from a handling perspective it

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.479 
great from a handling perspective it
does<00:04:01.280> open<00:04:01.519> up<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.090> interior<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.489> you

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
does open up the interior of it so you

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.630 
does open up the interior of it so you
now<00:04:04.670> have<00:04:04.700> some<00:04:05.570> very<00:04:06.410> impressive<00:04:06.769> legroom<00:04:07.459> in

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
now have some very impressive legroom in

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.729 
now have some very impressive legroom in
the<00:04:07.730> rear<00:04:07.880> seats<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:09.140> course<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.530> get

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
the rear seats and of course you get

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.759 
the rear seats and of course you get

these really cool magic seats and so

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.550 
these really cool magic seats and so
while<00:04:13.010> some<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.640> chassis<00:04:14.560> compromises

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
while some of the chassis compromises

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.640 
while some of the chassis compromises
have<00:04:16.030> made<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.299> fit<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.780> little<00:04:18.109> bit<00:04:18.290> less

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
have made the fit a little bit less

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.110 
have made the fit a little bit less
sharp<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.370> corners<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.799> still<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:22.120> that
