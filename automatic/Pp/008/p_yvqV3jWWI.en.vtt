 mothers of gta that is by the way here 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.140

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.769
 finding more conceptual arts of 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.440
 how would this cj be in hd or in high 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.690
 definition in gta 5 then 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.930
 sincerely, what art has been 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.750
 of this cj is impressive imagine yourself 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.580
 so be it and not only jota but the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.010
 other protagonists of the gt as 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.439
 previous the truth that good work 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.340
 does this guy called alex horne 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.159
 and the truth 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.380
 what is tsj it looks really good and this kind of 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.450
 works the truth is that they are appreciated 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.640
 Since they are honestly very 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.740
 difficult to achieve and maybe and rockstar 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.020
 go take some inspiration that does not 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.630
 I doubt it but it could be possible that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.149
 will take an inspiration and even made 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.539
 his own gta character that is called 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.399
 alex cornyn and cj would have more or less 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.250
 about 40 years from the 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.979
 events of gta san andreas and if 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.289
 more or less would have like those 40 years 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.229
 He even has a haircut 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.750
 grove street style and a tattoo and 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.079
 You can see very well what you think 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.149
 that they did a remodeling in hd e 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.599
 even in the mods that by the way the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.369
 gta 5 is already going to go to pc so 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.700
