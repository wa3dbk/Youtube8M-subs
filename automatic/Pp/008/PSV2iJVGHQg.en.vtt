for for dust proof I believes dust proof
and<00:00:56.100> also<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> extend<00:00:57.210> some<00:00:57.750> water<00:00:58.289> resistance

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and also to extend some water resistance

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459 
and also to extend some water resistance
so<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.199> can't

so you get a little it but you can't

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.779 
so you get a little it but you can't
submerge<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.010> fully<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.550> you're<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
submerge it fully so if you're in the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.310 
submerge it fully so if you're in the
rain<00:01:02.940> discussion<00:01:03.539> should<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.049> able<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
rain discussion should be able to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.939 
rain discussion should be able to
withstand<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
withstand it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
withstand it
also<00:01:05.430> drops<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
also drops just because it has this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.039 
also drops just because it has this
