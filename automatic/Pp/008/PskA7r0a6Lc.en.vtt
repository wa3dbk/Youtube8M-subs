terminology<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.900> really<00:00:16.110> good

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
terminology and this is a really good

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.939 
terminology and this is a really good
technique<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:17.190> learn<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.410> busy<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:19.770> it's

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
technique to learn and busy because it's

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.000 
technique to learn and busy because it's
a<00:00:20.039> great<00:00:20.279> way<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.990> beginning<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:22.110> project<00:00:22.140> in

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
a great way of beginning your project in

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
a great way of beginning your project in
a<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.370> soft<00:00:23.670> way<00:00:24.030> because<00:00:24.990> sometimes<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
a really soft way because sometimes you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.680 
a really soft way because sometimes you
can<00:00:25.590> get<00:00:25.710> quite<00:00:25.860> a<00:00:25.920> hard<00:00:26.220> edge<00:00:26.460> when<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.910> chain

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
can get quite a hard edge when you chain

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.420 
can get quite a hard edge when you chain
to<00:00:27.930> start<00:00:28.230> especially<00:00:28.530> if<00:00:28.770> you're<00:00:28.890> working<00:00:29.070> in

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
to start especially if you're working in

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.319 
to start especially if you're working in
a<00:00:29.880> double<00:00:30.450> crochet<00:00:30.660> pattern<00:00:31.230> anyway<00:00:32.329> what

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
a double crochet pattern anyway what

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.760 
a double crochet pattern anyway what
better<00:00:33.539> than<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.899> able<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> actually<00:00:34.500> start

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
better than be able to actually start

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.500 
better than be able to actually start
straight<00:00:35.129> into<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> stitch<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> use

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
straight into the stitch you want to use

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
straight into the stitch you want to use
if<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.960> pattern<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.670> quite<00:00:38.789> easy

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
if your pattern it's actually quite easy

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
if your pattern it's actually quite easy
to<00:00:39.089> do<00:00:39.359> once<00:00:39.659> you<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.960> hang<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.199> it<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to do once you get the hang of it so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.259 
to do once you get the hang of it so
hopefully<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.640> help

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
hopefully this will help

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.599 
hopefully this will help
so<00:00:43.199> if<00:00:43.350> first<00:00:43.530> thing<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.069> to<00:00:44.249> create<00:00:44.519> our

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
so if first thing to do is to create our

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.419 
so if first thing to do is to create our
slipknot<00:00:48.229> I've<00:00:49.229> done<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> slower<00:00:49.769> video<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.249> how

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
slipknot I've done a slower video on how

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.540 
slipknot I've done a slower video on how
to<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.699> that<00:00:50.819> if<00:00:50.999> you<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> watch<00:00:52.229> that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
to do that if you want to watch that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.219 
to do that if you want to watch that
just<00:00:53.550> check<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.030> channel<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:55.079> all

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
just check out my channel and then all

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.969 
just check out my channel and then all
we<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.589> is<00:00:55.679> chain<00:00:56.069> two<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:58.620> try<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.889> keep

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
we can do is chain two to try and keep

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.229 
we can do is chain two to try and keep
it<00:00:59.100> quite<00:00:59.339> loose<00:01:00.019> just<00:01:01.019> easier<00:01:01.319> to<00:01:01.350> work<00:01:02.239> chain

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it quite loose just easier to work chain

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.290 
it quite loose just easier to work chain
one<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:05.180> chain<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.560> yep<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.120> then<00:01:09.120> all<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
one and chain see yep and then all we

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.840 
one and chain see yep and then all we
need<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.310> start<00:01:11.310> our<00:01:11.520> double

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
need to do now is start our double

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.450 
need to do now is start our double
crochet<00:01:12.210> stitches<00:01:12.540> normal<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.530> yarn<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
crochet stitches normal so yarn over and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
crochet stitches normal so yarn over and
then<00:01:14.910> we're<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.300> through<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.600> first

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
then we're going to go through our first

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
then we're going to go through our first
chain<00:01:16.790> like<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.120> pull<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.260> yarn<00:01:19.290> through<00:01:20.540> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
chain like so pull our yarn through but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.430 
chain like so pull our yarn through but
what<00:01:21.660> we're<00:01:21.780> guys<00:01:21.900> you're<00:01:22.050> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> do

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
what we're guys you're going to do

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.870 
what we're guys you're going to do
differently<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.190> we're<00:01:23.370> just<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> go

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
differently is we're just going to go

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
differently is we're just going to go
through<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> first<00:01:24.540> loop<00:01:26.300> like<00:01:27.300> so<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
through the first loop like so that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.830 
through the first loop like so that
crates<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.980> technically<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:29.970> chain<00:01:30.330> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
crates are technically our chain and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
crates are technically our chain and
then<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.440> work<00:01:31.650> our<00:01:31.920> double

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
then we're going to work our double

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730 
then we're going to work our double
crochet<00:01:32.280> stitch<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.180> normal<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.990> yarn<00:01:34.590> over

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
crochet stitch as normal so yarn over

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
crochet stitch as normal so yarn over
through<00:01:35.010> two<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.990> yarn<00:01:37.680> over<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.360> through

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
through two and yarn over and through

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.140 
through two and yarn over and through
two<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> side<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.910> can<00:01:41.940> see

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
two and this is a side where you can see

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
two and this is a side where you can see
your<00:01:42.270> first<00:01:42.570> foundation<00:01:43.380> stitch<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.340> are

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
your first foundation stitch these are

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
your first foundation stitch these are
with<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.640> stitches<00:01:45.030> you'll<00:01:45.150> be<00:01:45.240> working<00:01:45.690> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
with the stitches you'll be working in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
with the stitches you'll be working in
on<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.740> next<00:01:47.010> round<00:01:48.560> what<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.830> for<00:01:49.980> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
on the next round what we do for the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
on the next round what we do for the
next<00:01:50.340> stitch<00:01:50.580> which<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.970> where<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.300> can<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
next stitch which is where it can get a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990 
next stitch which is where it can get a
little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:51.870> complicated<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.830> we<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.820> do

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
little bit complicated is we just do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.930 
little bit complicated is we just do
yarn<00:01:54.330> over<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.640> side

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
yarn over and as you can see this side

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.399 
yarn over and as you can see this side
we've<00:01:57.720> created<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.590> stitch<00:01:59.960> there<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> can

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we've created a stitch there if you can

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.680 
we've created a stitch there if you can
see<00:02:01.650> there<00:02:01.920> those<00:02:02.400> two<00:02:02.430> pieces<00:02:03.150> so<00:02:03.390> we're<00:02:03.659> just

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
see there those two pieces so we're just

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.620 
see there those two pieces so we're just
going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.230> underneath<00:02:05.150> or<00:02:06.150> through<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
going to go underneath or through that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.550 
going to go underneath or through that
stitch<00:02:08.090> catch<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.539> side

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.780 

like<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:15.860> pull<00:02:16.100> our<00:02:16.280> yarn<00:02:16.550> through

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
like so and then pull our yarn through

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.550 
like so and then pull our yarn through
and<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:20.450> we're<00:02:20.569> going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.990> go<00:02:21.200> through

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and then we're going to just go through

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then we're going to just go through
the<00:02:22.100> first<00:02:22.910> loop<00:02:23.150> only<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.930> did<00:02:24.080> before

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the first loop only like we did before

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.740 
the first loop only like we did before
and<00:02:24.760> then<00:02:25.760> we're<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.150> complete<00:02:26.569> our

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and then we're going to complete our

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.440 
and then we're going to complete our
double<00:02:27.230> crochet<00:02:27.260> stitch<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.880> through<00:02:29.810> two<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
double crochet stitch so through two and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.080 
double crochet stitch so through two and
then<00:02:32.450> through<00:02:32.840> two<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.100> then<00:02:34.760> you've<00:02:34.910> got

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
then through two and then you've got

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.570 
then through two and then you've got
your<00:02:35.300> second<00:02:35.810> double<00:02:36.800> crochet<00:02:36.830> foundation

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
your second double crochet foundation

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.850 
your second double crochet foundation
stitch<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.569> here<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.410> will<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.560> you've

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
stitch and here you will see you've

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.040 
stitch and here you will see you've
created<00:02:40.100> another<00:02:40.550> stitch<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.480> side<00:02:41.720> as<00:02:41.900> well

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
created another stitch this side as well

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.350 
created another stitch this side as well
which<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.350> these<00:02:42.680> two<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.910> worked<00:02:44.150> through

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
which is these two so you worked through

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.330 
which is these two so you worked through
those<00:02:44.510> two<00:02:44.840> before<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:46.070> we're<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
those two before and now we're going to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.020 
those two before and now we're going to
work<00:02:46.519> through<00:02:46.790> these<00:02:46.940> two<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:49.640> do<00:02:49.760> yarn

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
work through these two so we do yarn

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.449 
work through these two so we do yarn
over<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:52.780> through<00:02:53.780> our<00:02:54.709> stitch<00:02:55.070> at<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.310> back

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
over and through our stitch at the back

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.930 
over and through our stitch at the back
like<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:59.239> can<00:02:59.420> see<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.750> man<00:03:00.790> pull<00:03:01.790> our

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
like so you can see that man pull our

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.059 
like so you can see that man pull our
yarn<00:03:01.970> through<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.200> good<00:03:03.319> idea<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.709> keep<00:03:03.830> this

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
yarn through it's good idea to keep this

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.009 
yarn through it's good idea to keep this
quite<00:03:04.310> loose<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.630> see<00:03:05.870> these

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
quite loose and so you can see these

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.750 
quite loose and so you can see these
stitches<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> work<00:03:06.709> through<00:03:07.160> otherwise<00:03:07.519> these

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
stitches to work through otherwise these

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.040 
stitches to work through otherwise these
can<00:03:08.000> get<00:03:08.150> quite<00:03:08.510> lost

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
can get quite lost

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.100 
can get quite lost
so<00:03:09.400> try<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.489> work<00:03:10.640> quite<00:03:10.940> loosely<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.750> then

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
so try and work quite loosely and then

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.100 
so try and work quite loosely and then
we<00:03:12.230> go<00:03:12.350> through<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.680> first<00:03:12.950> stitch<00:03:13.280> only<00:03:13.519> and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
we go through the first stitch only and

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.180 
we go through the first stitch only and
then<00:03:15.110> we're<00:03:15.290> going<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> work<00:03:15.650> our<00:03:15.890> double

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
then we're going to work our double

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.490 
then we're going to work our double
crochet<00:03:16.220> stitch<00:03:18.220> like<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:20.350> then<00:03:21.350> we've

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
crochet stitch like so then we've

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.430 
crochet stitch like so then we've
created<00:03:21.680> our<00:03:22.070> third<00:03:22.370> stitch<00:03:23.299> this<00:03:23.570> side<00:03:23.840> you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
created our third stitch this side you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.080 
created our third stitch this side you
should<00:03:24.470> be<00:03:24.650> working<00:03:25.040> on<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> next<00:03:25.340> round<00:03:25.730> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
should be working on the next round and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
should be working on the next round and
here<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:27.079> see<00:03:27.290> we've<00:03:27.500> created<00:03:27.650> another

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
here you can see we've created another

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.840 
here you can see we've created another
chain<00:03:29.269> stitch<00:03:29.570> there<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.579> yarn

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
chain stitch there so then we do yarn

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.800 
chain stitch there so then we do yarn
over<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:33.579> then<00:03:34.579> we<00:03:34.760> go<00:03:34.910> through<00:03:35.180> our<00:03:35.209> third

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
over and then we go through our third

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.180 
over and then we go through our third
stitch<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.380> back

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.470 

you<00:03:44.790> can<00:03:44.940> get<00:03:45.060> quite<00:03:45.300> loose<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.360> we'd

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
you can get quite loose and then we'd

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.560 
you can get quite loose and then we'd
escape<00:03:48.840> through<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.140> first<00:03:49.410> loop<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:51.300> do<00:03:51.420> our

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
escape through the first loop to do our

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.570 
escape through the first loop to do our
chain<00:03:51.870> as<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.140> were<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.650> then<00:03:53.250> we'll<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.550> our

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
chain as it were and then we'll do our

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.240 
chain as it were and then we'll do our
double<00:03:53.940> crochet<00:03:54.120> stitch<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.530> finish<00:03:55.740> so

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
double crochet stitch to finish so

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.780 
double crochet stitch to finish so
through<00:03:56.580> two<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:58.320> three<00:03:58.680> two<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.520> then<00:03:59.670> we've

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
through two and three two and then we've

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.410 
through two and three two and then we've
created<00:03:59.940> our<00:04:00.270> full<00:04:00.480> stitch<00:04:02.000> let's<00:04:03.000> get<00:04:03.210> some

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
through the first loop and then do our

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.260 
through the first loop and then do our
double<00:04:30.570> crochet<00:04:31.080> stitches<00:04:31.410> normal<00:04:32.270> so

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
double crochet stitches normal so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.100 
double crochet stitches normal so
through<00:04:33.540> two<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.680> through<00:04:35.130> two<00:04:35.400> then<00:04:35.990> we<00:04:36.990> get

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
through two and through two then we get

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.020 
through two and through two then we get
off<00:04:37.260> if<00:04:37.470> stitch<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.250> we<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:38.490> continue<00:04:38.910> along

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
off if stitch and we just continue along

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.390 
off if stitch and we just continue along
until<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.600> get<00:04:39.750> your<00:04:39.840> desired<00:04:39.900> length<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.860> it

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
until you get your desired length and it

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.740 
until you get your desired length and it
can<00:04:41.490> sometimes<00:04:41.610> start<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.150> curl<00:04:42.330> up<00:04:42.450> like<00:04:42.480> this

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
can sometimes start to curl up like this

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.320 
can sometimes start to curl up like this
we<00:04:42.960> just<00:04:42.990> need<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:44.250> work<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.760> work<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
we just need to to work it work it

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.140 
we just need to to work it work it
straight<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:47.430> I'll<00:04:47.520> do<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.640> couple<00:04:47.850> more

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
straight and so I'll do a couple more

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.730 
straight and so I'll do a couple more
and<00:04:48.419> then<00:04:48.750> all<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.880> I'll<00:04:50.880> turn<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:54.560> keep<00:04:55.560> that

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
and then all the I'll turn to keep that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.159 
and then all the I'll turn to keep that
quite<00:04:56.010> loose<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:56.880> through<00:04:57.180> one<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.900> create<00:04:58.110> our

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
quite loose so through one to create our

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.740 
quite loose so through one to create our
chain<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.970> then<00:04:59.970> do<00:05:00.270> a<00:05:00.300> double<00:05:00.750> crochet<00:05:01.430> so

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
chain and then do a double crochet so

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.960 
chain and then do a double crochet so
let's<00:05:03.750> see<00:05:03.900> yarn<00:05:04.140> over<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.770> then<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.640> go<00:05:05.790> for

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
let's see yarn over and then we go for

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.140 
let's see yarn over and then we go for
this<00:05:06.090> one

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.540 

I<00:05:11.180> think<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.930> hardest<00:05:12.260> thing<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.710> learn<00:05:13.490> about

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
I think the hardest thing to learn about

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.900 
I think the hardest thing to learn about
this<00:05:13.850> technique<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.540> knowing<00:05:15.290> what<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.910> stitch

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
this technique is knowing what to stitch

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.340 
this technique is knowing what to stitch
through<00:05:17.150> at<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.330> back<00:05:17.510> because<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.139> can<00:05:18.260> all

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
through at the back because it can all

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.140 
through at the back because it can all
get<00:05:18.500> a<00:05:18.530> bit<00:05:18.710> confusing<00:05:19.280> but<00:05:19.550> if<00:05:19.669> you<00:05:19.729> keep<00:05:20.000> this

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
get a bit confusing but if you keep this

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.870 
get a bit confusing but if you keep this
quite<00:05:20.419> loose<00:05:21.070> just<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:22.310> particular<00:05:22.729> loop

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
quite loose just that particular loop

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.950 
quite loose just that particular loop
there<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.510> can<00:05:23.750> make<00:05:24.139> it<00:05:24.290> easier<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.740> find<00:05:25.040> on

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
there it can make it easier to find on

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.189 
there it can make it easier to find on
the<00:05:26.960> next<00:05:27.199> round<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:28.490> so<00:05:28.820> so<00:05:29.510> there<00:05:29.660> we<00:05:29.750> go<00:05:29.780> so

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
the next round like so so there we go so

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.780 
the next round like so so there we go so
that's<00:05:30.290> basically<00:05:30.830> double<00:05:31.490> crochet

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
that's basically double crochet

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.070 
that's basically double crochet
foundation<00:05:32.000> stitches<00:05:33.340> we've<00:05:34.340> created<00:05:35.080> two

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
foundation stitches we've created two

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.469 
foundation stitches we've created two
four<00:05:36.530> six<00:05:36.889> repeated<00:05:37.370> seven<00:05:37.790> stitches<00:05:38.060> there

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
four six repeated seven stitches there

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.260 
four six repeated seven stitches there
so<00:05:39.260> we<00:05:39.770> start<00:05:40.070> counting<00:05:40.610> definitely<00:05:41.060> count

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
so we start counting definitely count

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.850 
so we start counting definitely count
that<00:05:41.419> be<00:05:41.540> there<00:05:41.750> we<00:05:41.900> just<00:05:42.050> count<00:05:42.260> one<00:05:42.320> two

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
that be there we just count one two

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.279 
that be there we just count one two
three<00:05:43.270> four<00:05:44.270> five<00:05:44.810> six<00:05:45.289> seven<00:05:45.970> like<00:05:46.970> so<00:05:47.289> and

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
three four five six seven like so and

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.980 
three four five six seven like so and
then<00:05:48.650> what<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:48.800> do<00:05:49.150> for<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.210> next<00:05:50.330> round<00:05:50.660> is<00:05:50.870> I

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
then what I do for the next round is I

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.260 
then what I do for the next round is I
always<00:05:51.919> do<00:05:52.070> it<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.220> same<00:05:52.430> way<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.639> just<00:05:53.120> do<00:05:53.240> a

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
always do it the same way I just do a

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.750 
always do it the same way I just do a
chain<00:05:53.600> one<00:05:53.919> which<00:05:54.919> I<00:05:55.039> don't<00:05:55.100> count<00:05:55.520> as<00:05:55.729> a

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
chain one which I don't count as a

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.420 
chain one which I don't count as a
stitch<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.389> then<00:05:56.510> I<00:05:56.630> turn<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:57.260> then<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.280> just

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
stitch and then I turn and then I just

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.930 
stitch and then I turn and then I just
work<00:05:58.639> straight<00:05:59.060> into<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.830> into<00:06:00.830> that<00:06:00.860> row<00:06:01.220> the

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
work straight into the into that row the

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.330 
work straight into the into that row the
first<00:06:02.180> stitch<00:06:02.449> on<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:03.020> next<00:06:03.169> row<00:06:03.880> like<00:06:04.880> so<00:06:06.340> so

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
first stitch on the next row like so so

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.100 
first stitch on the next row like so so
before<00:06:07.699> when<00:06:07.880> we're<00:06:08.030> doing<00:06:08.240> our<00:06:08.479> foundation

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
before when we're doing our foundation

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.510 
before when we're doing our foundation
chains<00:06:09.320> we're<00:06:09.500> working<00:06:09.919> into<00:06:10.160> these<00:06:10.280> back

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
chains we're working into these back

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.390 
chains we're working into these back
stitches<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:11.660> create<00:06:11.780> our<00:06:12.080> chains<00:06:12.440> but<00:06:13.250> we'll

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
stitches to create our chains but we'll

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.469 
stitches to create our chains but we'll
actually<00:06:13.490> get<00:06:13.760> on<00:06:13.880> the<00:06:13.970> next<00:06:14.210> row<00:06:14.330> we're<00:06:14.449> going

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
actually get on the next row we're going

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.659 
actually get on the next row we're going
to<00:06:14.630> working<00:06:14.810> into<00:06:15.169> these<00:06:15.320> top<00:06:15.590> stitches<00:06:16.190> like

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
to working into these top stitches like

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.790 
to working into these top stitches like
so<00:06:16.940> then<00:06:17.270> just<00:06:17.389> continue<00:06:17.870> along<00:06:17.960> as<00:06:18.229> normal<00:06:18.590> as

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
so then just continue along as normal as

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.250 
so then just continue along as normal as
per<00:06:19.010> your<00:06:19.130> pattern<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:20.570> I<00:06:20.780> hope<00:06:20.960> you<00:06:21.020> find<00:06:21.139> it

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
per your pattern so I hope you find it

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.620 
per your pattern so I hope you find it
useful<00:06:21.410> and<00:06:22.270> I'll<00:06:23.270> do<00:06:23.450> some<00:06:23.599> more

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
useful and I'll do some more

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.360 
useful and I'll do some more
instructional<00:06:24.080> videos<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:24.889> can<00:06:25.039> think<00:06:25.220> of

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
instructional videos and I can think of

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.159 
instructional videos and I can think of
things<00:06:25.580> that<00:06:26.090> you<00:06:26.419> might<00:06:26.570> want<00:06:26.630> to<00:06:26.840> know<00:06:27.020> and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
then I'll see if I can do a video okay

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.600 
then I'll see if I can do a video okay
have<00:06:34.370> fun
