a<00:01:57.180> better<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.630> our<00:01:57.720> idea<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.130> put

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
a better of our idea of when it was put

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.310 
a better of our idea of when it was put
there<00:01:59.580> obviously<00:02:00.270> technology<00:02:00.510> has<00:02:00.900> moved<00:02:01.110> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there obviously technology has moved on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.500 
there obviously technology has moved on
since<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> 60s<00:02:02.159> they'll<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.400> using<00:02:02.610> them

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
since the 60s they'll be using them

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.290 
since the 60s they'll be using them
using<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.960> radiocarbon<00:02:04.520> dating<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.000> pinpoint

using a radiocarbon dating to pinpoint

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.270 
using a radiocarbon dating to pinpoint
exactly<00:02:06.540> when<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> blue<00:02:07.680> stones<00:02:07.950> are<00:02:08.129> brought

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
exactly when the blue stones are brought

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.649 
exactly when the blue stones are brought
here<00:02:08.489> they're<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> smaller<00:02:09.090> ones<00:02:09.299> by<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> way

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
here they're the smaller ones by the way

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.509 
here they're the smaller ones by the way
the<00:02:10.170> big<00:02:10.319> ones<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> saucer<00:02:10.859> the<00:02:11.039> stones<00:02:11.310> came

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
the big ones the saucer the stones came

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.429 
the big ones the saucer the stones came
a<00:02:11.579> lot<00:02:11.760> later<00:02:11.909> they're<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:12.659> so<00:02:12.810> important<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
a lot later they're not so important in

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:13.890 
a lot later they're not so important in
this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
this

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.600 
this
is<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:14.620> small<00:02:14.830> blue<00:02:15.040> stones<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.519> you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
is the small blue stones as you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.280 
is the small blue stones as you
mentioned<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.060> came<00:02:16.269> from<00:02:16.450> Wales<00:02:16.720> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
mentioned that came from Wales that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.580 
mentioned that came from Wales that
they're<00:02:17.470> really<00:02:17.800> interested<00:02:18.489> in
