00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.339
 to open the albert heijn in shopping mall den hof in alalst without 11 euros 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.250
 just open its doors despite the opening bid of the appeals board 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.029
 for business 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.659
 the supermarket as an exemption for opening on Sundays in the latter 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.919
 period of 2009 and assumed that this exemption took effect after the trial period 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.029
 be automatically converted into a permanent exemption 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.400
 however, this was not the case 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 the C1000 had meanwhile officially applied for an exemption for 2010 and went 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 take it off 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.130
 and now seem to be a true supermarket war, as far as I am concerned 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:34.950
 not 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.409
 we want our customers 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:37.820
 happy to be of service 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.630
 and the customer is for questions on Sunday shopping 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.600
 the district police officer must come from where the alderman wants the lawyer without help 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 keep the year generally try one further had me though 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 the battlefield 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.530
 they with the maintenance year it concerns the court 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.970
 what did join in on Sunday 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
 it's just about to fall the day the test 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.989
 instead of two supermarkets on Sunday 3 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.330
 behind us is driving certainly the other neighborhoods take the effort 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.390
 it is not a question of an open well-being in 2009 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.530
 we have no problem with it if a competitor is open 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.400
 the whole piece but the organs have been put there almost a year ago 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.220
 sell the shares 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.400
 I don't know I'm all overly satisfied 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 after two days 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.880
 9 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.130
 the judge announced this week yes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.980
 yes it is an arrangement 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.620
 officially the municipality as women must impose a sanction on albert heijn 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.160
 because they open anyway 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.820
 whether that will happen is not yet certain 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.260
 yes we all see yes heard the risk of heart problems 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.050
 we are awaiting what a sanction is imposed by the municipality
