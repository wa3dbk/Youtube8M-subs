00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.450
 hi to all guys and welcome back up 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 those two on server 2 with an argument 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 a topic as you know these bullock 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 small talk about well-targeted topics 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.269
 and today we talk about a topic that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.029
 so small it is not who it is not 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.830
 small because in effect when yes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 he talks about video games especially those who don't 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.150
 plays video games always pulls in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.660
 this violence is the dance 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.390
 it is the guiding line in some way 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 which is often discussed 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 makes the numbers do especially the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 newspapers 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.670
 exact is not the first time when 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.399
 something bad happens it gives 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 somehow to blame for some copy of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.520
 call of duty that is in the room of a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.960
 boy a little scarperia iron maiden e 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.809
 This is not the first time we talk about 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.070
 videogames as an activity 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.680
 educational and violent 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.949
 now violence in our opinion goes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 to codify it that is what violence is 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 I don't have and violence is a behavior 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.430
 human that is aimed at hurting a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.250
 someone else then the videos you already have 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.340
 for itself 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 it is no longer a representation of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.540
 violence is not that you finished playing 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.460
 to something never in the street on his lap 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.100
 your n 4 which is under the bed e 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.710
 people are starting to shoot 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.010
 state of cases, but there are 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.030
 also of the cases of priests that the priests in 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.680
 a fan of doctors that doctors don't do 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.070
 but maybe he doesn't play video games 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.900
 strangely yes the speech is if someone 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.700
 makes a killing in a school with a 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.520
 rifle is in his house there is a pair of 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.410
 dumas tour the colleagues all atom but if 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.960
 one makes a slaughter beats his wife 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.759
 he beats and children in his house there is one 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.340
 copy of a mouse because it was not a fault 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.619
 that is, this is not the speech 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.320
 one can connect so easily 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.270
 mental or simple imbalance 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.580
 badness of a person to the video game 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.250
 who is playing and this is a topic 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.160
 that comes back out in cycles no 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.640
 the cycle of violence is 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.830
 coming back in vogue as it was a few years ago 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.239
 ago when we did it because it is 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.910
 a topic we have already discussed 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.840
 on the first channel one of our first 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.910
 video 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.190
 let's say cooperative youtuber in themselves 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.959
 this was precisely this topic 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.410
 the violence is unfortunately we find ourselves 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.750
 always come back to why because the tv 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
 come back to us because they are always the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.290
 same as the topics they hunt in 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.660
 our first black video a lot fall 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.690
 small at the time struck me so much 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.879
 vision of 75 kele we called aa 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.950
 to say two words on the subject you are 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.590
 a lot of things violence in 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.629
 video games there is no violence 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.849
 exists in the world and as video games 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.380
 they are inspired by the world that is colombier of 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.329
 a war game the war has it 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.880
 invented type activision invented it 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.980
 people like people invented it 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.049
 so I make a videogame inspired by the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.650
 In reality reality is there to be scanned there 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.780
 fire 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 the difference is that when you finish 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 playing video games no one is in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.890
 all are hospital in war 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.769
 wounded 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.610
 if today we hear so many paradises if many 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.680
 flights will miss the fuck is they do 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.930
 to see people that kill in 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.260
 direct cut the head live 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.200
 so 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.109
 and you think that repeating those 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.989
 images to the tg of people died for 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.090
 earth does not do worse in minds 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.160
 of people because that is real people 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.260
 real people also because we suppose that 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.150
 if you go out you start shooting with 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.430
 a rifle 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.200
 probably if he is willing to do it 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.970
 even without your copy of cod 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.290
 or of battlefield we believe that one 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.120
 such person does it too 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.639
 reading Christian family 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.590
 basically because if you are sicop 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.169
 atico 6 psychopath 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.340
 we have grown up with children now 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:04.700
 they grow with peppa pig and age bis and 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.739
 with stuff that really is 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.680
 free of any kind of aggression 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.319
 any kind of 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.239
 to us at their age we looked ken the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.489
 warrior who blew up the 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.729
 heads people who swelled him 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.039
 capoccia the brain did not explode 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.710
 we have a criminal record I am not 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.240
 never got into a fight never 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.949
 we have not had such a thing 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.199
 never beat anyone 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.110
 our girls are with you but there is 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.400
 however it is that I had a period in which 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.080
 I was close to people 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.039
 I did the seven points from which I did not 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.440
 no one was there to say too much 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.690
 close yes we were children they did ie 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.789
 we were either cars that didn't scald 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.310
 that was the best he could 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.830
 happen and we think in the end it is 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.110
 all tied to you not the game that 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.000
 play the book I will read to movies that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.030
 look if you are people 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.979
 balanced you have a good education 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.250
 there is no violent message there 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.289
 may among living parents of state parents 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.930
 don't worry we won't break your balls 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.310
 your children rather be close to him 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.650
 teach him the education draw the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.260
 what good things and you will see that they can 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.120
 also read but in the field but will remain 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.820
 always good guys and this thing 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.550
 trees say mario and nicola where the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.620
 those two on the server two people 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.849
 that we grew up with violence e 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.419
 who stand here in front of a camera 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.099
 with a pair of Kalashnikovs on the side but 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.080
 are fake specialist headlines 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.620
 plastic is true that I never did 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.620
 hurt anyone 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.930
 he says his ass broke
