this actually attach you have the bottle
of<00:02:07.469> solution<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.759> take<00:02:08.970> off<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> lid

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of solution and you take off the lid

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.630 
of solution and you take off the lid
that<00:02:10.170> comes

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
that comes

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.170
