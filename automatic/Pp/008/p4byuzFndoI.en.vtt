with<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.579> comparison<00:01:50.390> from<00:01:50.420> last<00:01:50.930> year<00:01:51.259> if

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
with the comparison from last year if

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.770 
with the comparison from last year if
you<00:01:51.890> look<00:01:52.070> at<00:01:52.219> their<00:01:52.429> /<00:01:52.729> 40<00:01:53.149> three-point

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
you look at their / 40 three-point

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.200 
you look at their / 40 three-point
shooting<00:01:54.110> numbers<00:01:54.289> they're<00:01:54.740> pretty<00:01:55.310> close<00:01:55.520> so

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
shooting numbers they're pretty close so

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.899 
shooting numbers they're pretty close so
i<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.600> use<00:01:56.899> i<00:01:57.229> wanted<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.950> use<00:01:58.130> his<00:01:58.369> standing

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
i just use i wanted to use his standing

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.899 
i just use i wanted to use his standing
in<00:01:59.149> moving<00:01:59.929> three-pointers<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:01.700> i

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
in moving three-pointers as that but i

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.149 
in moving three-pointers as that but i
just<00:02:02.119> decided<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.600> use<00:02:02.720> 2<00:02:02.990> k's<00:02:03.259> moving<00:02:03.890> three

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
just decided to use 2 k's moving three

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.850 
just decided to use 2 k's moving three
pointer<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.759> i<00:02:05.240> left<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.170> standing

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
pointer and i left the standing

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.120 
pointer and i left the standing
3-pointer<00:02:07.369> at<00:02:07.399> 85<00:02:08.030> instead<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> 84<00:02:09.259> but<00:02:09.890> he

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
3-pointer at 85 instead of 84 but he

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.940 
3-pointer at 85 instead of 84 but he
still<00:02:10.340> has<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.519> 75<00:02:11.150> rating<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.080> at<00:02:12.410> least<00:02:12.650> that's

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
still has a 75 rating so at least that's

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.490 
still has a 75 rating so at least that's
good<00:02:13.040> like<00:02:13.640> mine<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.450> originally<00:02:14.840> came<00:02:15.170> up

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
good like mine that I originally came up

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.789 
good like mine that I originally came up
with<00:02:15.709> had<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> 75<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.790> 2k<00:02:17.150> has<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> 75<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.470> this

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
with had a 75 and 2k has a 75 and this

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.580 
with had a 75 and 2k has a 75 and this
final<00:02:19.160> version<00:02:19.489> also<00:02:19.670> has<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.940> 75<00:02:20.540> ready<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.140> at

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
final version also has a 75 ready so at

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.009 
final version also has a 75 ready so at
least<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.250> very<00:02:22.549> consistent<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.780> that's

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
least that is very consistent so that's

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.039 
least that is very consistent so that's
good<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.099> decided<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.790> quit<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.480> Kobe

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
good so I just decided to quit the Kobe

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.309 
good so I just decided to quit the Kobe
nines<00:02:27.290> instead<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.130> Kobe<00:02:28.610> tens<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.660> yeah

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
nines instead of the Kobe tens so yeah

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.610 
nines instead of the Kobe tens so yeah
that's<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.680> only<00:02:30.890> thing<00:02:31.069> no<00:02:31.340> accessories<00:02:32.030> in

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that's the only thing no accessories in

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.500 
that's the only thing no accessories in
attributes<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.400> definitely<00:02:34.610> used<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.360> lot

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
attributes here I definitely used a lot

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.530 
attributes here I definitely used a lot
of<00:02:35.660> 2<00:02:35.840> k's<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.160> also<00:02:37.459> kept<00:02:37.880> some<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.239> mine

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
of 2 k's but I also kept some of mine

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.190 
of 2 k's but I also kept some of mine
the<00:02:38.780> same<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.880> driving<00:02:40.880> layups<00:02:41.239> standing

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the same so like driving layups standing

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.440 
the same so like driving layups standing
lay<00:02:42.380> up<00:02:42.560> in<00:02:42.769> like<00:02:42.980> post<00:02:43.310> hook<00:02:43.549> post<00:02:43.819> paid<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
lay up in like post hook post paid a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.600 
lay up in like post hook post paid a
bunch<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.140> kind<00:02:45.349> of<00:02:45.530> stuff<00:02:45.769> shot<00:02:46.370> mid

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
bunch of that kind of stuff shot mid

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.340 
bunch of that kind of stuff shot mid
range<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.000> shot<00:02:47.150> close<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.690> well<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.200> I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
range and shot close as well because I

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.920 
range and shot close as well because I
don't<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.560> any<00:02:48.920> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.459> statistics<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.630> get

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
don't have any kind of statistics to get

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
don't have any kind of statistics to get
those<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.889> I<00:02:51.920> definitely<00:02:52.400> use<00:02:52.940> 2<00:02:53.120> k's<00:02:53.329> for<00:02:53.359> that

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
those so I definitely use 2 k's for that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.720 
those so I definitely use 2 k's for that
in<00:02:53.989> all<00:02:54.440> these<00:02:54.650> tendencies<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.459> said

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
in all these tendencies like I said

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.800 
in all these tendencies like I said
these<00:02:55.850> were<00:02:56.000> just<00:02:56.120> Jerick<00:02:56.540> Smith's

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
these were just Jerick Smith's

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.440 
these were just Jerick Smith's
tendencies<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.280> thought<00:02:58.549> out<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:59.000> pretty

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
tendencies so I thought out a pretty

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.199 
tendencies so I thought out a pretty
solid<00:02:59.810> comparison<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.829> I<00:03:00.859> just<00:03:01.220> use<00:03:01.489> Jeff

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
solid comparison so I just use Jeff

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.360 
solid comparison so I just use Jeff
Smith's<00:03:02.510> tendencies<00:03:03.139> again<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.130> did

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
Smith's tendencies again but I did

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.190 
Smith's tendencies again but I did
switch<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.329> signature<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> didn't

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
switch it up to the signature I didn't

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.620 
switch it up to the signature I didn't
leave<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> same<00:03:06.889> because<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:08.000> he's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
leave it the same because they he's

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.330 
leave it the same because they he's
definitely<00:03:09.049> he<00:03:09.739> definitely<00:03:09.859> shoots

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
definitely he definitely shoots

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.000 
definitely he definitely shoots
differently<00:03:10.880> from<00:03:11.060> JR<00:03:11.420> smith<00:03:11.720> so<00:03:12.260> I'm<00:03:12.829> gonna

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
differently from JR smith so I'm gonna

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.830 
differently from JR smith so I'm gonna
show<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.430> signature<00:03:13.790> i<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:14.030> here<00:03:14.389> you

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
show you the signature i have here you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
show you the signature i have here you
can<00:03:14.989> see<00:03:15.200> how<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.560> shot<00:03:15.889> comparators

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
can see how the shot comparators

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.940 
can see how the shot comparators
real-life<00:03:16.850> self<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.510> vine<00:03:17.959> as<00:03:18.260> usual<00:03:18.769> i'll

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
real-life self on vine as usual i'll

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.590 
real-life self on vine as usual i'll
leave<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.639> comments<00:03:20.150> or<00:03:20.239> something

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
leave it in the comments or something

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.690 
leave it in the comments or something
like<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.780> but<00:03:21.560> yeah<00:03:21.859> here's<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.310> rest<00:03:22.519> of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
like that but yeah here's the rest of

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.670 
like that but yeah here's the rest of
his<00:03:22.819> signature<00:03:23.299> he's<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.569> stiff<00:03:23.959> ball<00:03:24.200> handler

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
his signature he's a stiff ball handler

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
his signature he's a stiff ball handler
so<00:03:24.889> he<00:03:24.980> doesn't<00:03:25.250> have<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.670> signature<00:03:26.299> size<00:03:26.630> up

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
so he doesn't have a signature size up

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.319 
so he doesn't have a signature size up
and<00:03:27.139> he's<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.410> one-footed<00:03:28.099> dunker<00:03:28.579> he's<00:03:28.760> very

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
and he's a one-footed dunker he's very

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.990 
and he's a one-footed dunker he's very
athletic<00:03:29.709> unlike<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:31.010> know<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> lot<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.639> Euro

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
players that come out he's very athletic

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.059 
players that come out he's very athletic
and<00:03:34.730> he<00:03:35.299> has<00:03:35.540> caught<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.049> few<00:03:36.349> windmills<00:03:36.859> in

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
and he has caught a few windmills in

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
of plays if he doesn't really get

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.569 
of plays if he doesn't really get
touches<00:03:47.239> on<00:03:47.540> offense<00:03:48.049> then<00:03:48.799> he<00:03:49.099> kind<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.430> gets

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
touches on offense then he kind of gets

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.069 
touches on offense then he kind of gets
out<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.180> he<00:03:50.359> doesn't<00:03:50.540> put<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:50.930> as<00:03:51.049> much

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
out of it he doesn't put in as much

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.100 
out of it he doesn't put in as much
effort<00:03:51.409> on<00:03:51.920> defense<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.629> kind<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.900> told

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
effort on defense so that kind of told

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.390 
effort on defense so that kind of told
me<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.290> give<00:03:54.409> him<00:03:54.530> volume<00:03:54.950> shooter<00:03:55.280> in

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
me to give him volume shooter in

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.100 
me to give him volume shooter in
microwave<00:03:55.879> because<00:03:56.030> if<00:03:56.239> he's<00:03:56.390> hitting<00:03:56.750> his

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
microwave because if he's hitting his

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.020 
microwave because if he's hitting his
then<00:03:57.740> he's<00:03:57.890> going<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.070> get<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.400> rhythm<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
then he's going to get in rhythm and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.870 
then he's going to get in rhythm and
that's<00:03:59.300> going<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.600> go<00:04:00.290> towards<00:04:01.070> his<00:04:01.220> defense<00:04:01.700> I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
that's going to go towards his defense I

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.150 
that's going to go towards his defense I
guess<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:03.080> kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.440> has<00:04:03.620> an<00:04:03.740> effect<00:04:04.040> on

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
guess so that kind of has an effect on

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.460 
guess so that kind of has an effect on
how<00:04:04.400> he<00:04:04.460> plays<00:04:04.790> defense<00:04:05.240> and<00:04:05.510> he<00:04:05.840> kind<00:04:06.290> of<00:04:06.350> has

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
how he plays defense and he kind of has

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.590 
how he plays defense and he kind of has
