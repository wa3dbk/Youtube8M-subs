00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
description of this video there will be

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.420 
description of this video there will be
this<00:00:47.850> code<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.960> want<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> copy<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> code<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this code you want to copy that code and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.470 
this code you want to copy that code and
by<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> way<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.600> works<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.789> 1.7.9<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.180> later

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
by the way this works in 1.7.9 and later

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.810 
by the way this works in 1.7.9 and later
and<00:00:54.809> by<00:00:55.140> later<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.500> mean<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> snapshots<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.610> one

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and by later I mean the snapshots if one

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
and by later I mean the snapshots if one
point<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.180> isn't<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.370> you're

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
point out isn't out for you when you're

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.779 
point out isn't out for you when you're
watching<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.050> um<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.309> works<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.579> one

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
watching this um so it works with one

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
watching this um so it works with one
point<00:01:02.940> seven<00:01:03.300> point<00:01:03.480> nine<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.930> later<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
point seven point nine or later and so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.550 
point seven point nine or later and so
once<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> code<00:01:06.659> copied<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.350> want

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
once you have that code copied you want

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520 
once you have that code copied you want
to<00:01:08.000> go<00:01:09.000> into<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.420> world<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.350> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
instead of one three seven you want to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.950 
instead of one three seven you want to
type<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:34.040> some<00:01:35.040> manned<00:01:37.070> block<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
type in some manned block like that and

type in some manned block like that and
hit<00:01:40.829> enter<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.600> then<00:01:42.600> you'll<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:43.320> yourself<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
command block and so once you have this
command<00:01:48.570> block<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.930> wanna<00:01:49.079> place<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> down

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
command block you wanna place it down

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.539 
command block you wanna place it down
and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:51.240> right<00:01:52.229> click<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.009> open<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
and then paste in that code with control

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.190 
and then paste in that code with control
V<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.369> then<00:01:59.369> once<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.000> pasted<00:02:00.570> then

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
get a button a torch pressure plate

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.340 
get a button a torch pressure plate
anything<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> powers
