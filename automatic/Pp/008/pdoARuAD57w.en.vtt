00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.790
 then this suzuki method was used to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.070
 children and I father this principle there to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.780
 People can do this for adults. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.059
 It's not like we're kids anymore because 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 one of the basic things is that the child 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 is inserted in the middle and such 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 really easy to learn really 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 so if you have a son, you will have a son. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 if you want him to play cool already 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 this from the beginning of support to music 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 to listen you do not need to train technique 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 nothing, and you're in touch with 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.520
 music I started with music at age 10 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.350
 nine years old more or less more 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 Before, I already heard enough music 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.950
 and I do not have any musicians in my 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 family did not have all this influence 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.379
 but my parents there are like that I 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.910
 I would like to listen to them 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 Let's listen to music, that was already 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 very important in my training and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.140
 learning more forward 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.350
 and suzuki method adapted to it. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.480
 adults and / or part of the following principle 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.149
 if the subtle one that the child learns 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.580
 she could hold a tongue 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 just as she learned the Japanese language 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 from so much in the middle so I would learn 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.369
 music the same way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.540
 for people who are more adult learn 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.700
 music would be like if we had 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 learn a second language then 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 people did not learn there when we 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 I was 34 years old but we want to learn 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.670
 music now, so it's a lot 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.479
 for example you wanted to learn to speak 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 English 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.340
 Ok, so you do not know, I do not know. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 It is difficult for you to see a person 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 talent to speak English she has a gift 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.979
 to speak in English, huh? 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 it is this other person does not have the gift to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.220
 speak english she will never be able to speak 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.570
 in English she does not have the gift of oil 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 You 'll never do well in English. 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.290
 there is this and for the same thing not 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.820
 There is in the music for you to learn. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 What's the English you have to happen? 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 What study do you have to study? 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.670
 studying at a music school you can 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 being with a teacher or sometimes you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 can study is looking for in the translator 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.990
 of life looking on the internet 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.180
 looking videos that your looking for 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 some way you have to have contact 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.590
 with what you have to start listening to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.930
 watch movies in English even if it is 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.099
 subtitles are you have to start watching 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
 texts in English 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.440
 and that the environmentalization each when 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.970
 more in Spanish tite rohde ali 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.260
 You'll start learning and going. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 start to speak the first words 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.940
 because it was a phrase yes wanting you already 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.500
 If you already speak English, you already passed through 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.220
 this process I tell you that music is 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.050
 much the same 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.060
 if you still do not tell me if you're 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.340
 wanting to learn learning English from 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.170
 learn another language right then 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 also says that the process of music 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.920
 even at the beginning it 's chatinha there because 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 have to get used 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.120
 It's more, things are gradually going. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.550
 You'll find out you're going. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.710
 identifying words on the menu in your 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.870
 always heard simple design to write 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.150
 You're starting to translate some 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.460
 things in music work just like the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.560
 say the following song is much more 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.510
 easy to learn english much easier 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.580
 learn Portuguese ok 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.740
 it is not because music is an art that she 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.840
 it has a different way music is not 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.360
 a language with so much today I have 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 music I speak music understood I 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.250
 I can think of a thinking song. 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.930
 melodic line and I can play in the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.070
 My instrument can listen to you. 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.660
 play back 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.490
 So why is it a language? 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.080
 the people when you are studying 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.670
 independent music from your book you 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.040
 wants to start developing this 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.320
 musical language in you and this is what 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.030
 my pre- training site is training because people 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.980
 takes very much into account improvisation 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.000
 things like that because because I need 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.610
 that you 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.739
 the nanny gradually acquired the language 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.120
 Music is much simpler than it has 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.280
 much less much less 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.959
 possibilities than for example the 23 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 letters of the alphabet you have to 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.760
 form words phrases and everything else then 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.130
 it is much less for you to learn and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.170
 It may take time for you to learn why 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.970
 asking is not in touch with music 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.290
 in the same way already in contact with the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.690
 Portuguese language, for example, people 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.580
 you have less time to contact him but 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.860
 he is listening to a song and this is not 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.450
 and we do not stay that long in 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.890
 contact with the music but of any 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.780
 It is this contact with the music that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.769
 will help you to progress musically 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 OK 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.590
 and does not have this talent story 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.500
 It's okay if you see a person 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.810
 who speaks English for 20 years 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.440
 she speaks well not speech has talent 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.030
 and talk, she 's getting used to it. 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.320
 lived in the United States she is 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.519
 accustomed to English after she 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.140
 speaks well okay 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.090
 and if you think I play well I'll 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.280
 I say I 'm studying here too 20 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.850
 I've already been 20 years in the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.710
 with music and is that of this learning 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.780
 I ended up learning to play what 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.120
 I play do what I do on guitar and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.639
 guitar way to teach and everything 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.230
 It's not talent, I know. 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.540
 people want to tell me that I have 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.180
 talent for this, I'm grateful 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.500
 He was flattered and appreciate the compliment right 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.600
 because I know what people want 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.639
 say when I have talent but I do not 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.580
 background is that I know it was not talent was 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.560
 Workout was training, then you mean 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.330
 It will take you 20 years to play. 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.070
 Just like me, it's not what we have 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.810
 what do you think people have to think 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.790
 everyday we want to improve one 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.740
 so that it is motivating for the 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.669
 people to study more and better and 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 a little more 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.260
 I did not when I was training, did not I? 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.660
 I was thinking here 20 years I'm going to play 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.520
 well the idea is not the following the idea is 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.320
 I trained that when I wanted to play the 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.160
 music is asking the music now I want 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.770
 learn another 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.570
 like now I want to lose another liked and 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.280
 Now I want to learn another and go on like this. 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.630
 today today I am studying and 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.760
 I'm always doing things like this but 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.410
 if that is the great motivator 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.330
 it is with this practice with this evolution 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.740
 step by step we'll play 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.540
 every time we get better every time 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.320
 more happy with what we play 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.750
 huh 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.330
 you can not touch it is not total 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.780
 starting on the guitar there I've been there for six 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.340
 months 53 months right now and sometimes 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.800
 music that at first is simple you 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.229
 Are you happy because you play that song? 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.780
 and this is what will make your evolution not 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.789
 and do not think you have no talent 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.030
 So I'm not going to play either. 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.640
 have to train and have qe 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.590
 contact and having patience is the 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.650
 more important is you have fun with 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.900
 music then this is the method such né 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.280
 and from it that what I inspired 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.410
 I always believed in this idea more 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.539
 when I first met the idea of suzuki 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.919
 He does not believe in talent in me. 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.110
 I identified a lot and started using 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.870
 widely all the ideas of suzuki 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.130
 to play there for guitar teaching 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.710
 guitar I do 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.350
 Okay, and to close and if this video goes 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.620
 sentence that opens one of the books of the 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.390
 suzuki taag will have until then the 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.650
 reference if you take it you well 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.050
 interesting in this book 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.700
 but his main sentence is the one that is 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.150
 The one that closes the video is also what I 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.600
 I believe and I go to my students 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.600
 here on the site 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.509
 O
