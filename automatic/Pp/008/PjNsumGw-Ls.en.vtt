actually disguise as that texture so you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.820 
actually disguise as that texture so you
can<00:01:09.400> set<00:01:09.880> up<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.030> big<00:01:10.210> wall<00:01:10.450> right<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.619> these

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
can set up a big wall right of these

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.460 
can set up a big wall right of these
outside<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.970> they'll<00:01:13.570> camouflage<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
outside and they'll camouflage to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.940 
outside and they'll camouflage to
whatever<00:01:14.799> is<00:01:14.920> closest<00:01:15.430> next<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.240> them<00:01:16.950> now

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
whatever is closest next to them now

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.499 
whatever is closest next to them now
unfortunately<00:01:18.189> take<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.640> little<00:01:19.180> while<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
unfortunately take a little while to

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:20.850 
unfortunately take a little while to
break<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:19.869> think<00:01:20.080> they<00:01:20.200> should<00:01:20.380> break<00:01:20.590> kind<00:01:20.740> of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
break I think they should break kind of

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
break I think they should break kind of
like<00:01:20.979> glass<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.689> know<00:01:22.780> it's<00:01:22.930> not<00:01:23.049> a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
like glass but you know it's not a

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.630 
like glass but you know it's not a
really<00:01:23.409> big<00:01:23.770> problem<00:01:23.920> they<00:01:24.159> probably<00:01:24.369> break

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
really big problem they probably break

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 
really big problem they probably break
easier<00:01:24.970> with<00:01:25.119> that<00:01:25.329> with<00:01:26.110> an<00:01:26.229> axe<00:01:26.409> because

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
easier with that with an axe because

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.219 
easier with that with an axe because
they<00:01:26.890> feel<00:01:27.700> like<00:01:27.909> wood<00:01:28.150> yeah<00:01:28.900> they<00:01:29.049> break

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229
