00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 the chevrolet d20 arrived in Brazil in 1985 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.660
 she was a derivative of chevrolet 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 2,500 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.550
 about 2,500 at the time. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.740
 Americans were changing the line of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 pickup trucks 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.000
 in 85 86 and sent to Brazil the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.960
 old presses 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 the old 2.500 model and the Chevrolet 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.180
 brazil imported suspended and started 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 produce from 20 in brazil 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 only that the chevrolet has modified in the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.650
 truck because the 2,500 American is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.170
 very characteristic an American pickup truck 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.790
 is very different from the cost of the Brazilian 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 at least that was the claim 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.780
 chevrolet from brazil then they 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.500
 modified that pickup truck some 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 clear the bulk points is the same the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.100
 size the panel dimensions is everything even 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.229
 books is everything even if they have changed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.180
 is that the American chevrolet had the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.799
 ties here in which it would then be 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 chevrolet from Brazil took these stand 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.350
 left smooth at the head of the assembly 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.369
 merchant afrmm auto plus one on top of 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 other 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.540
 here in Brazil was used in front of the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 opal of 20 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.329
 So the brazilian chevrolet made some 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.979
 modifications of the American pickup truck 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.469
 for the Brazilian market other than 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 ford that bore identical f-1000 sold 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.469
 I did not move in the United States. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.700
 anything 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.859
 the chevrolet did not chevrolet the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.649
 case of D-20, I thought it was better 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:49.350
 drawing of chevrolet from brazil with more 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.179
 harmonious American had a drawing 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.329
 very strange the rear flashlight 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.299
 American military was little 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.789
 Weird cover had some relief 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.829
 Weird then the arrival of Brazil. 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.229
 hit and move is 20 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.870
 before launching in brazil then well then 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.590
 arrived in 85 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.590
 it was novelty in the market try it 's cover 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 chevrolet d10 as 10 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.530
 then she was a slut of an evolution in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.040
 diesel version she won the same engine 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.690
 of 10 with few changes practically 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.830
 won only 10 horses with some 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.750
 good manager and nozzle changes and an engine 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.190
 that vibrated - because it had the coxinhas 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.120
 to stay 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.050
 that is, it has not changed practically nothing is and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.110
 c 20 and 20 was the engine of the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.420
 opal the old acquaintance of paulo then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.800
 it was the pec in the version says that now 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.470
 received the name that 20b is and the engine of the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.900
 paulo alcohol with gasoline 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 she arrived only in the single cabin in the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.070
 market in 85 but soon in 86 87 already came 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.710
 the double cabin and there will be ney 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.840
 The double cabin was made by Brazil that 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.140
 here in Brazil to Brazil that it was 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.010
 responsible for the area of ​​2000 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.230
 half of the basic thing ended 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.810
 Brazil did with excellence used a 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.090
 even thicker sheet that is used 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.310
 by chevrolet 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.500
 then up to 20 double cabin was very 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.930
 desired that Brazil today has 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.819
 people who wish to have one was a 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.709
 car and was very successful in Brazil 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.049
 there will be none too in the 88 88 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 also came the bonanza that nothing else 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.110
 was that it maintains 20 simple cabins 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.170
 closed as a light blazer had his 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.870
 problems having a spring bundle will bring 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.319
 make her jump a lot but it 's a good 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.489
 car is also 20 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.430
 she had several special series several 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.220
 types of decorative side bands 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.750
 but the big change of 2010 was in the year 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.750
 from 1991 to '92 when her mechanics 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.230
 was changed diesel engines passed with 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.690
 an evolution named max were 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.239
 engines that had higher performance 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.180
 largest economy quieter and vibrates 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.320
 - the transmissions were also changed 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.280
 by the easier traditions of engaging the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.160
 interior was all changed in 93 a panel 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.320
 new headrests new headrests 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.120
 higher and 92 see the turbo engine 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.390
 is that he was far more than the others 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.180
 diesel diesel engines with yard 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.640
 overdrive finally rear differential and 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.140
 force distribution 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.770
 so it 's a pickup truck that she sees 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:04.200
 evolving over the years and into the year of 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:07.740
 1994 from 94 to 95 a new one happened 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.990
 change in production or from 20 to 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.870
 Volley sent the production line of 20 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.940
 for Argentina because it was a 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.700
 truck so good and so good at sending 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.980
 for Argentina because this idea is 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.690
 chevrolet bringing s10 to brazil 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.250
 needed an assembly line for 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.050
 produce s10 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.870
 then he pick up the assembly line from the 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.320
 d-20 to produce gives room for 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.630
 s10 produce betting on a segment 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.730
 lower on the market 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.200
 chevrolet bet that the market 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.840
 would rather accept a smaller truck and 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.710
 easier to maneuver aif bet on 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.260
 s10 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.240
 then the assembly line of 20 was 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.670
 for argentina but when it is 20 it was 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.970
 For Argentina, it was only in the simple cabin that 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.770
 Double summer cabin has been discontinued 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.790
 the bonanza also not only continued 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.170
 producing the simple cabin in argentina 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:06.770
 and began to manufacture this 1095 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.110
 d-20 Brazil and here in after day 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.860
 20 was present in them invoiced two more 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.620
 years 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:18.680
 23 95 96 and 97 were very few 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.470
 manufactured in the cabin because they are still 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.780
 it was not poor case but only to order 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:28.190
 Brazil was still doing another one after 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:32.420
 94 but ad 20 blue as we did 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:35.320
 much success in brazil she f 1000 and no 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.150
 was a healthy rivalry in the market 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.910
 and it arrived is always went well always 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.700
 had good sales with this car and even 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.460
 There are a lot of people running around 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.440
 in perfect state 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.190
 Suspension bodywork 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.920
 are many durable and 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.570
 miss the market 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.570
 This is it, people are the next.
