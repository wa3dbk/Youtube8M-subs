00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.430
 hello to all youtube 92 and I bring you then 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.330
 nothing a tutorial how to get the 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.400
 absorbing weapon crushes the zombies and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 good nothing else I hope you like it and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.000
 I leave with the video in the first place 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.259
 we have this piece that would be made then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 here as serving we left the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.399
 first area where we went to the beginning 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.050
 the map and we would have to get off at 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 highway as you have to see now where 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 I see where you can see that I go down there 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 we have to lower what is important and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 recommend is to make it faster 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.090
 possible in the least possible rounds and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.280
 we have to lower it then when I 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.899
 say 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.170
 we have to pass the bridge first 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.489
 I would say no we do not have to go down here and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.940
 As you can see we already have the black tube what 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.940
 I'm watching here 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.060
 Y 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 for today here and good I hope you have 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.019
 liked the first piece we see the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.259
 next 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.149
 in the second piece of this tutorial 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.829
 to make this weapon we will find 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.929
 here as you see we are in farm how much 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.310
 start the bus we have to get off at 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.719
 half of the cornfield here as seen going to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.179
 to stay you see yourself make a lame 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.549
 that do not bother us in this tutorial and 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.890
 what we have to do 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.360
 Nothing, the only thing we have to have 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.549
 is now when we pass in the middle of 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 country to the voucher now I will explain it when 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.969
 you see the national to make it easier 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.120
 when we go by the side of the cornfield 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.920
 we will have to go down 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.480
 and go down a little path and we'll arrive 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.480
 to be a totem 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.439
 not to be a hotel as you see the cornfield 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.460
 rocks here when there is here country 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.510
 we have to go down 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.630
 attentive to 170 we go down 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.640
 let's say around here I want the moles of the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.830
 bugs we throw everything straight and now as 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.910
 you're going to see there's no you could not right 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.400
 so we pull to the left and now 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.200
 that there will be a small path to the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.409
 right that now here you are going to see 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.580
 look at it 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.500
 well let's say 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.790
 let's go straight and here we come to the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 art of a totem and here we have to catch 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.890
 a piece that is usually here, nothing more 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 is here can be here can not either 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.310
 to be here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.849
 no, I'm not here 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.950
 Look at the list that we have taken as you see 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.840
 down a turn and well see you in the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.340
 next the third piece of this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.950
 tutorial may be 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.019
 well look let's reanimate the piece 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.420
 it's there as I'm seeing it had 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.640
 caught the is this is worth a fan 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.720
 that I will explain like this after there is here 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.000
 it is diva 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.860
 can leave 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.140
 here you can continue here 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.270
 and you can also leave 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.150
 here not here no forgiveness here always comes out 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.960
 it is then there is here 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.550
 in the author 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.200
 good was the window this trunk and in 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.950
 that also usually leave something that is not 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.390
 I know 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.710
 here also because it's worth it here when 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.600
 be here you can keep to pick up 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.220
 stone and good we liked it we see it 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.160
 in the fourth piece 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.930
 and the fourth piece of this tutorial is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.430
 here when she is by the bus to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.280
 town you have to run here 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.150
 backwards you will attack the bowling 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.579
 as usual 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 as always, always always close to the 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.989
 so it can be as much as possible and 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.360
 keep running backwards where 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 coach would come until you'll see what 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.620
 that we would arrive we will reach a 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.799
 shack to say it like that of the house 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.520
 abandoned and demolished more or less old 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.820
 she's alone 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.730
 and how they feel they attack them and we're going to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.960
 see how we take that piece we throw for 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.130
 ahead until we find a fire 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.230
 here in the middle as we are near the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.500
 forest is the house and now you will see the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.500
 fire 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.170
 sorry we have to go for here we continue 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.599
 everything is straight 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.940
 always straight until we get there 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.620
 here as you see the fire and here you see a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.470
 shanty that the bologna has to go 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.510

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.430
 that was here and nothing we have already 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.669
 caught we go back to town to do the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.669
 weapon 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.960
 once we have the four pieces and 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.370
 we are a town we open this box and 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.370
 as you can see they are seeing clearly 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.630
 we create the piece 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.300
