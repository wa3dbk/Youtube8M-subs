00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
oh wow I'm sure you were just being

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.580 
oh wow I'm sure you were just being
facetious<00:02:28.209> with<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.380> no

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
facetious with that that you have no

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.190 
facetious with that that you have no
idea<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.190> funny<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.880> right<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:32.050> had

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
idea how funny that is right now you had

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.840 
idea how funny that is right now you had
no<00:02:32.470> way<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.709> knowing<00:02:33.190> that's<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.489> thing<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.790> do

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
no way of knowing that's the thing I do

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.300 
no way of knowing that's the thing I do
all<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.300> time<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:34.840> with<00:02:34.959> zeros<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:36.100> is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
all the time but with zeros this is

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.550 
all the time but with zeros this is
great<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:37.570> onto<00:02:37.750> something<00:02:38.320> here

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
