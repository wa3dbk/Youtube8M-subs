 create 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:04.509
 a request to make an exchange 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.969
 let's put Leonel Messi and for 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.789

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.360
 only you think 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.360
 so you can make three requests 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.849

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.719
 exchange requests 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.840
 to see if we are lucky and they change us 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:04.659
 the cards we will enter our 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.699

 because you already have the album the other 60% 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.389
 Well, we're going more or less the same then 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.819
 percent 205 percent ten percent 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.300
 hundred to me it puts me that I have 5 for 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:25.029
 cent but recently we got to 11 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.710
 percent will have to be updated vale 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.629
