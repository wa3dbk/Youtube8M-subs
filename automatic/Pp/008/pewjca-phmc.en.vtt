00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050 
I think just for times sake and and the
artist<00:02:24.720> then<00:02:25.020> would<00:02:25.320> decide<00:02:25.950> what<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.730> make<00:02:26.880> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
juniors run-on daredevil is probably one

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.160

of<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.080> most<00:04:35.530> satisfying<00:04:36.430> things<00:04:37.390> that<00:04:38.020> ever

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
of the most satisfying things that ever

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.940 
of the most satisfying things that ever

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
happened because it turns out that I

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.800 
happened because it turns out that I
worked<00:04:42.400> on<00:04:42.520> daredevil<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> short<00:04:43.480> period

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
worked on daredevil for a short period

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.960 
worked on daredevil for a short period
of<00:04:43.840> time<00:04:43.900> but<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.290> felt<00:04:44.590> like<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:44.860> was<00:04:44.980> mine<00:04:45.190> he

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
of time but I felt like it was mine he

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.480 
of time but I felt like it was mine he
then<00:04:46.150> took<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.540> run<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.110> quite<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.620> run<00:04:47.920> the

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
then took a run on it quite a run the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.400 
then took a run on it quite a run the
thing<00:04:48.730> with<00:04:48.910> John<00:04:49.090> Jr<00:04:49.480> is<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.930> didn't<00:04:50.260> have<00:04:50.290> to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
thing with John Jr is I didn't have to

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.500 
thing with John Jr is I didn't have to
critique<00:04:50.710> him<00:04:51.190> because<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.240> thing<00:04:52.480> that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
critique him because the thing that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.810 
critique him because the thing that
mattered<00:04:53.170> most<00:04:53.200> was<00:04:53.680> storytelling<00:04:54.430> which<00:04:54.610> was

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
mattered most was storytelling which was

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.300 
mattered most was storytelling which was
natural<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:55.510> him<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.770> comes<00:04:57.010> about<00:04:57.250> from

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
natural to him and that comes about from

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.100 
natural to him and that comes about from
the<00:04:57.550> fact<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.910> when<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.390> started<00:04:58.930> there
