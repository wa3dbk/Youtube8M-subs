00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.360
 Five red lights. Wait until it quits. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.720
 My God! 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.640
 This is a Volvo FH truck. And this ... was the car 1: One. 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.960
 I'm Tiv Nidel I'm driving the world's first truck with a dual-clutch gearbox 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.640
 Depends on race car technology. 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.760
 Here, the Volvo FH truck was tested with a two-clutch I-Shift gearbox 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.640
 At the Knotstorp race circuit in Sweden 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.280
 Where we will borrow the One: 1 car, the world's first mega-car 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 In a final confrontation 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.600
 Where I challenge the Quinigsig test driver in a race. 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 I think we can cut a cycle by truck 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.480
 In less than a period of two weeks. 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.240
 I know what you are thinking now. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.800
 On the side, we have a heavy-duty heavy transport truck 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.640
 Volvo FH Truck 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.800
 On the other hand, one: 1 Kinigsg 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.360
 Two completely different cars work for completely different purposes. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 So what brings us to a supercar to test a truck? 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.520
 Volvo claims to be under the hood of this truck 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 There is a sports car heart. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 So I came to see the truth of this claim. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640
 Which candidate is better for this comparison than Quinigsg One: 1 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 The first ever mega-car. 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 This gearbox technology is available in race cars and sports cars 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 Since the mid-1980s 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 Its main objective is to allow faster acceleration 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.880
 A very attractive feature in a racing car. 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.320
 But in a truck, its function over this little bit. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.240
 After spending most of my life 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.400
 Behind the wheel are different racing cars and sports cars 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.080
 And even Formula 1 cars 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.440
 I consider myself a test driver capable of an acceptable extent. 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.480
 But to help me with some of the truck's specials 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.040
 I brought with me a specialist in the matter. 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.920
 Jeff Beard, Director of Pressure Testing for Volvo Trucks 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 To tell me everything about this amazing new gearbox. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.440
 I'll definitely do ya, but I'm a little worried 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 On what has been prepared for us. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.040
 the challenge. Do not worry about this. This will be done later. 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.200
 Let's first drive this truck. I should start working. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.200
 Release the manual brakes and we will be ready to move. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.680
 Come on. 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 The road is a bit tight here. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 I feel it's great to me, Jeff. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.800
 never. You can handle it, Tiv, it will not be a problem. 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 hairpin. 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.840
 Tires insist. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.440
 Is it a reduction of foot movement or not? 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.600
 Yes, by reducing the motion of the foot. Press the pedal to the floor only. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.880
 Opening the throttle valve is something fun. It starts. 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.560
 The acceleration is amazing for a truck. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.280
 Note that I do not pay a trailer. A bit rude. 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.400
 There are only eight tons on the track today. 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.960
 It crosses the curves very well. 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.120
 Light steering of the steering wheel and good response. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.720
 I thought I would manage the handle on the steering wheel for better control. 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600
 - The brakes! - Wonderful. 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.520
 it's working. I enjoy driving. I really enjoy driving. 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.760
 We are supposed here to talk about this amazing gearbox. 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.320
 I'll stop on this hill ... 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.240
 I want to start from a hill. I am in the third position of the movement now. 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320
 Accelerated acceleration. 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.440
 Fourth, I did not feel this. V ... I did not feel any move to the movement. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.120
 Fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth. 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.800
 Smooth transmission improves driving and makes it more comfortable. 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.440
 What purpose, purpose, main thing have you provided? 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.560
 Trucks do not need to be a racing car. What is the main goal? 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.880
 It improves performance, hillside performance, and acceleration 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.320
 As well as driving and comfort of course. 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120
 I feel very comfortable. 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440
 Well, where's the Quinigsig car? 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
 Well, Jeff, we've hired the nice people at Koenigsig 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.200
 The first car has a Mega power 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.640
 My risk is that we have to arrange a small challenge. 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.400
 Yes, that's what worried me all day. 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.240
 Nothing can go wrong. 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.720
 Of course we can not compare these two cars directly 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.760
 But I think we can do a truck ride 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.960
 Faster than One: 1 can perform two sessions. 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.160
 So, we're in an eight-ton truck 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.280
 Race with one of the fastest cars in the world. 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.280
 - What could be worse? - just chill. I am absolutely confident. 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 Are not you Robert? 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.240
 Do you see? This is Robert Cervansky. Official test driver for Quinigsig. 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.560
 It is quiet. We are about to show whether he is skilled or not. 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.040
 I'll give you some numbers. 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.440
 The car is 1360 horsepower and weighs 1360 kg 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 Making it a supercar in its chain 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.080
 The ratio of its strength to its weight 1 to 1. 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.920
 It also has a torque of 1371 Nm. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.720
 The truck is equipped with a 540 horse power motor 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.960
 Generates a torque of 2,600 nm 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.560
 Almost double the torque of the car. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.640
 Check engine torque. 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.320
 Amazing. 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.280
 The love of gears. 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.080
 Wait for the signal. What does it look like? A little small. 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.240
 I think he is worried, Tif. 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320
 The red lights are on. 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.760
 Five red lights. Wait until it quits. 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.600
 My God! 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.880
 Jeff, we accelerate faster. The Quinigsig started. 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.920
 I've just walked 95. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.800
 I should calm down for the turn. I almost forgot. 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.840
 It's sliding now, Jeff. It slips 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.600
 Maybe hurry up 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.520
 But in front of him all those turns, and two rounds to cut them. 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.520
 It's a great. It's a lot more fun than I thought. 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.360
 My God. This is something exciting. 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.600
 Can you see it? Have you disappeared? 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.520
 It has disappeared. It is already crossing the main road. 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.240
 What do they call this turnaround? 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.800
 It is called the turn of the idiots, and rightly so. 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.360
 Guidance is too low. 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.040
 The back lights up. 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.640
 nearly there. Where are the mirrors? 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.040
 I can see him coming. 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.640
 It has already come. I do not believe this. 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.160
 - Go, go, go! - We can keep progress. 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.480
 Here he comes. 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.040
 Will not pass from here. He has made his way. 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.160
 - No! It comes from here. - No. 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.720
 We made the finish line safe. 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.720
 We win. 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.560
 But at least we proved that the Volvo truck 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.200
 Its speed is half the speed of one
