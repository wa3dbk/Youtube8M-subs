00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 Some have told me that I no longer write 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.609
 what in two originals or interesting 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.609
 praguense this 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.940
 or the snake is greeted by the antichrist 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.650
 Today I will talk about the ones that I consider 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.820
 been the three generations of 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.340
 genres on youtube 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.620
 first of all this is what I 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.750
 agreement me and in the third generation already 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.450
 there's a shit so if I do not mention you 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 not you in chillies is nothing personal just 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.440
 I forgot about you by accident I'll try to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.380
 cover all especially in the third 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.780
 generation 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 and good as nobody has done it declared 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.250
 that this is the fucking official story of 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.420
 loquendo ha ha ha ha no good but it is the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.000
 only there is ha ha ha 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.610
 the loquendo began to become famous and 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.970
 popular for the year 2007 after Jesus 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250
 of Nazareth in those times of peace and love 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.229
 there were very few quality genres 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.299
 because nobody had styles nor was it so 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.149
 easy to use the lescott show or how to 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.280
 call the scrub that or the text law the 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.590
 first time of the loquendo had its pros 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.810
 and its cons emblematic figures 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 of the first generation were what 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.649
 integers that we all know as the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170
 ultra mint vice let's move from criticism 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.060
 against emos reggaeton otakus and pete 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.939
 pop is from the first generation the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.860
 antichrist 2007 the super troll that has 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.159
 survived until the third generation 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.619
 the illuminated 71 that I do not remember but 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.899
 that many loved Alex your com for the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.030
 supposed emo kill the god please and 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.099
 a Greek helm from which there was never 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.319
 heard hahaha conchudo and no longer 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.329
 I remember more the example par excellence 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.630
 of the first generation was the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.410
 antichrist 2007 this user was who 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.510
 Really 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 and the use of loquendo and the father of the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.220
 second generation of the genres the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.230
 videos of the antichrist were some very 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 fun but this user is 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 characterized by fomenting hatred between 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.590
 communities effect that goes like ring 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.270
 to finger to your username 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.270
 he was the father of all what in 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.350
 two offensive today and 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.690
 unfortunately also of all 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.390
 loquendo shit now the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.430
 antichrist 2007 also formed a pseudo 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
 army of the genres his famous 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.510
 thinking army that looked more like 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.490
 a ball of idiotic sheep without a brain 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 that even the Antichrist himself came to 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.020
 obviate by stating several times that you 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.640
 he made a fool of himself when he was called or great 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.660
 mister antichrist messiah 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.060
 Hahaha 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.370
 something that made also very special to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 Antichrist 2007 was that it was very difficult 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.000
 have contact with him 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.160
 the thinking army continues 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.870
 currently in existence and it is the source 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.150
 of the most boring loquendo and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.700
 repetitive ones because there are only copies 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.590
 bastards of what the antichrist 2007 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.710
 it did excepting some who have 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.020
 some good videos the illuminated 7 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.210
 good and know their history will devote 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.250
 an entire video to the subject the master of the 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.590
 troll so not and during the three 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.360
 generations the most attacked and ergo the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.510
 best troll in the history of loquendo 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.940
 of others I almost do not remember videos like this 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.820
 that I will leave this generation there when 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.650
 the end of the first generation is marked 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.440
 with the death of the original account of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.600
 antichrist 2007 after this 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.160
 event the thinking army 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.780
 he panicked 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.880
 their leader died and they began to 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.970
 disperse and create 10,000 accounts of 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.280
 antichrist 2007 all claiming him 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.890
 and all with the eternal hope that 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.140
 the antichrist 2007 will come back some day 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.610
 Hahaha 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.770
 this saw the second generation born 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.440
 of the shopkeepers the blackest era of 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.140
 When they appeared 10,000 copies of the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.329
 antichrist 2007 nobody made videos 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.239
 good neither offered anything new all the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.970
 2008 the other genres of the first 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.830
 generation also disappeared youtube 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.510
 was invaded 100 million of 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.480
 videos that talked about moderatto 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.510
 bands the emos the otakus and all the 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.070
 issues that the antichrist had criticized 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.419
 during this time those what in two 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.979
 what they looked like were from some 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.770
 survivors of the first generation 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.660
 and some summaries of the antichrist 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.270
 2007 by other users 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.340
 in this second generation there was nobody 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.930
 who to rescue because the good ones were 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.520
 some rather from the first 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.910
 generation that continued to work 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.320
 with desire but with very worn subjects the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.780
 transition from the second to the third 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.450
 generation was not as abrupt as the 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.160
 first to the second during the second 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.770
 generation were planted small 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.330
 seeds for the third generation the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.190
 second generation also 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.260
 he characterized as an era where 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.800
 loters were fighting too much between 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.199
 they 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.240
 making videos to each other and 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.789
 many others were in constant and 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.949
 distant with his audience began to use 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.659
 the loquendo to double series like bob 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.020
 sponge and a new type of loquendo 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.159
 It sapareciÃ³ the video game 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.620
 finally we come to the third 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.960
 the generation of this 2009 the most 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.060
 prosperous in this generation who 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.090
 predominant are the gamers and the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.830
 otakus in the third generation we have 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.110
 to some the first-class cauldrons 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.240
 generation that do not stand out that much but 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.219
 with videos with more than 10,000 views per 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.590
 its antiquity to the remnants of 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.960
 thinking army that they still do not give a 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.090
 with all fucking respect ball of vermin 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.250
 lol what pinches whole weekend 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.590
 of second generation that evolved 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.360
 this and they created the third generation already 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.270
 what the new ones called 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.819
 pure third-generation attention 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.889
 in the third generation and ayotzingo of 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.719
 the very good cauldrons here yes I am going to 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.280
 speak with subjective opinions for 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.360
 mention those that I consider the 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.150
 top 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.340
 First of all, the Antichrist 2008 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.310
 we are third generation but not 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.230
 we are pure of the initiators only 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.510
 sons whore those of dragonball evolution 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.610
 the one that considered the local but more 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.230
 emblematic of this generation is a 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.630
 subject who made videos about videogames 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.790
 and about fucking fanboys of the consoles 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.950
 of current generation something that 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.630
 characterizes third-party lotters 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.850
 generation is that it is no longer difficult 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.040
 talk with them and have contact 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.470
 also that in this generation they appear 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.480
 also the girls whatever you want the 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.340
 mother of what you find out for me was 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.350
 a whole crazy second generation 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.900
 that maybe they do not know his name 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.700
 user was fine is beautiful the other or 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.320
 rather the other whole crazy that 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.660
 considered emblem of the third 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.430
 generation is what a gift to the uterus not 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.560
 I know if I am considered an icon of the 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.630
 generation in turn that I leave it to 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.210
 public to decide to me I do not count on 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.010
 my review in this generation is also 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.770
 adds the use of the opening by some 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.930
 users as I mentioned the third 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.900
 generation is loaded with more and more 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.940
 and better the some great genres of 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.750
 the third generation that are already 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.760
 pure generation are carlos 38 thousand 841 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.020

 indications of a fourth generation since 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.630
 In addition, most users of third 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:11.310
 generation including me we have accounts 

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.310
 of backup with which we protect ourselves
