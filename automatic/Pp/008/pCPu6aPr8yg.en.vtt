00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.660
 Hello, I'm a person, will we start this or will we apply 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.930
 the cosan has seen the concepts left over 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.349
 in the production part economic issues 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.830
 the couple lasts about six minutes 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.119
 as we have seen in the other we have efficiency shortage 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.630
 economizes fundamental economics 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.860
 types economic frontiers and cuspidas production 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.630
 and the book 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.999
 christ a chapter a special reference 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.409
 we applied cancer consegi that this service is today we can easily see 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.140
 building materials 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.600
 not as brick cement 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 the labor available at some point the land available for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.850
 ramp up 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 the technology at any given moment 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500
 ah in history and a day for four hours 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.300
 time-limited resources are finite 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.530
 what people need roads 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 homes 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.090
 on this commercial surface 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.120
 health and education the hotel industry 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.700
 irritated 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.239
 so here we clearly have the scarcity 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.420
 in the context continued 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 but petric and science 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.170
 is in the production of the construction asserts the company 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.390
 to reassess 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.060
 how to combine 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.550
 I, for example, labor equipment 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.140
 so that a pig 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.609
 it's place of another 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.040
 I do not produce a reduction in overall efficiency 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.990
 of production even tom ana economy position 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.900
 to demonstrate can not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 to benefit 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830
 some types of cargo 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.140
 to others 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.060
 like this 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.160
 Czech course name is temp 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.370
 understand 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.060
 with the producing compounds 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.260
 is what the locals live with the truth 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.270
 to define what debris and saw produced that samus the society 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.060
 with produced 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 want to produce for whom 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 will be destined to the states of the construction activity 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.010
 microeconomic knowledge we have, for example, 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.580
 lebanon million study of housing supply and demand 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.550
 of fish was built 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.069
 the preferences of the income level 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.319
 consumers 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.980
 the deco never built to define their production 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.480
 others more than expected 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.290
 economy of the construction company and its buyers and consumers 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.629
 take economy ' 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.980
 is how it proceeded the series began badly that in part it generated employment 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.989
 inflation 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.619
 in the economy as a whole GDP 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:31.419
 on the emotional aspect the quotations of service of construction of 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:32.399
 home 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.729
 the bruising materials 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.989
 making the application cost us its fundamental economic fissure in the face 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.769
 and saw 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.669
 Location 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.199
 the activist and will be built on how much will be built 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.109
 each time being bought and that will produce its government to construct 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.520
 total business 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.769
 the sector and subcontractors 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.849
 disarming resource get such technology land 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.549
 with the technology will be used 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.089
 concrete or steel both cross damaged since it is 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:06.149
 in the distribution dog 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.279
 for whom 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.269
 the production of the possible 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.649
 It is believed that this population that benefits 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.259
 for example showed rude tone and sanitation 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.309
 and how to help deduct sales revenue 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.079
 everything is practicing economically 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.479
 in civil protection 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.809
 in the types of economy last Sunday a year 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.029
 construction companies and people decide 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.760
 is what is going to be produced and consumed that surrounded civilians 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.899
 We would advise you to carry out the works of government prevalence of all 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.429
 the mixed economies that is the case in Brazil 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:45.170
 and david printed government positions as 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.099
 the government also the economic box the team would guarantee other parties 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.079
 and the legal actions the collection 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.260
 one and public works 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.649
 acting sensitive 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.359
 the construction companies 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.989
 builds banks fund 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 people spared the commitment of mobile access 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.719
 posted for example 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.879
 recent 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.179
 this government only created 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.129
 when a pack of neighborhoods 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.419
 new 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.509
 P 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.680
 another moment 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.679
 like now 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.090
 companies build lots 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.479
 and in the condominiums that constitute practically 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.800
 whole new neighborhoods without government intervention 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.639
 applying post-production frontier concepts is an example not only of 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.629
 he saw himself 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.849
 denied given the set of labor land 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.500
 have to choose between you and will produce 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.750
 the fighter 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.169
 then the most graphic points present 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.710
 the possibilities 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.660
 d 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.569
 apartments and houses 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.569
 the siri be constructed account of the set of grounds 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.759
 and one of the labor priorities 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.759
 besides so to unite 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.439
 in kobe nations but the possible 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.710
 is the efficient frontier 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.629
 edivaldo are source of prosperity production 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:01.620
 is the point 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.320
 or else 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.069
 the combination of pockets also the disabled 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.009
 ground and access to land or 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.190
 good game and point ii an impossible coat of arms 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.490
 so that the combination of 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.520
 home 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.089
 all your heart 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.919
 is efficient 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.139
 resources for the level of production of 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.110
 every apartment we should vote mentor 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.800
 is possible by the region that goes from the point was more or less the point c until 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.220
 that point between the meeting point is gay 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.400
 would be the projection 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.530
 wu of the school in border efficient production possibility 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:41.539
 in the same way 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.270
 the production surveys of the mix point 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.729
 that it is not possible 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.629
 would be a descendant 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:49.279
 for such borders 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.949
 after the production 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.320
 all or so there talking seriously in the region between his point the ready- 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 and we here for example of application that succeeded in the concepts 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.960
 the help of 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.070
 and do not give up the book 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.000
 and also do yourself if one of these staff apply the concepts 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.699
 studied the confusion occurred 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.449
 this weighed 2 to 1 on adoption
