hi<00:00:04.760> everyone<00:00:05.330> a<00:00:05.590> couple<00:00:06.590> of<00:00:06.649> people<00:00:06.830> have

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
hi everyone a couple of people have

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.879 
hi everyone a couple of people have
asked<00:00:07.310> me<00:00:07.460> on<00:00:08.149> my<00:00:08.360> biology<00:00:08.570> forum<00:00:09.200> by<00:00:09.320> email<00:00:09.740> in

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
asked me on my biology forum by email in

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.829 
asked me on my biology forum by email in
the<00:00:09.980> last<00:00:10.190> couple<00:00:10.460> of<00:00:10.490> days<00:00:10.670> what<00:00:11.570> does<00:00:11.719> it

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
the last couple of days what does it

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.449 
the last couple of days what does it
mean<00:00:12.200> when<00:00:12.530> we're<00:00:12.620> talking<00:00:12.830> about<00:00:12.889> DNA<00:00:13.129> what

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
mean when we're talking about DNA what

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:14.619 
mean when we're talking about DNA what
does<00:00:13.549> it<00:00:13.639> mean<00:00:13.879> when<00:00:14.030> we<00:00:14.120> talk<00:00:14.150> about<00:00:14.330> the

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
does it mean when we talk about the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.440 
does it mean when we talk about the
three<00:00:14.990> prime<00:00:15.259> end<00:00:15.289> and<00:00:15.709> the<00:00:16.100> 5<00:00:16.400> prime<00:00:16.820> end<00:00:17.120> of

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
three prime end and the 5 prime end of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.540 
three prime end and the 5 prime end of
DNA<00:00:17.900> this<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.289> something<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:18.830> obviously<00:00:19.010> is

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
DNA this is something that obviously is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.550 
DNA this is something that obviously is
a<00:00:19.580> bit<00:00:19.790> confusing<00:00:20.300> to<00:00:20.480> people<00:00:20.870> and<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:21.530> I

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
a bit confusing to people and so I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.800 
a bit confusing to people and so I
wanted<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:21.980> just<00:00:22.130> explain<00:00:22.610> that<00:00:22.910> fairly

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
wanted to just explain that fairly

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.330 
wanted to just explain that fairly
briefly<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:24.260> think<00:00:24.350> it<00:00:24.560> really<00:00:24.830> helps<00:00:25.070> if<00:00:25.220> we

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
briefly I think it really helps if we

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.940 
briefly I think it really helps if we
start<00:00:25.610> off<00:00:25.730> by<00:00:25.790> looking<00:00:26.090> at<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.480> single

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
start off by looking at a single

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.490 
start off by looking at a single
nucleotide<00:00:27.950> of<00:00:28.220> DNA<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.450> and<00:00:30.230> we're<00:00:30.350> going<00:00:30.470> to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
nucleotide of DNA and and we're going to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.319 
nucleotide of DNA and and we're going to
look<00:00:30.620> at<00:00:30.740> not<00:00:31.070> only<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.520> 3<00:00:31.790> prime<00:00:32.000> end<00:00:32.029> in<00:00:32.270> the

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
look at not only the 3 prime end in the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.000 
look at not only the 3 prime end in the
5<00:00:32.509> prime<00:00:32.540> end<00:00:32.899> but<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> structure<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.920> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
5 prime end but but the structure of a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.250 
5 prime end but but the structure of a
nucleotide<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.539> we'll<00:00:35.690> look<00:00:35.780> at<00:00:35.899> what<00:00:36.109> it

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
nucleotide in and we'll look at what it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.160 
nucleotide in and we'll look at what it
means<00:00:36.999> to<00:00:37.999> talk<00:00:38.149> about<00:00:38.269> the<00:00:38.449> 3<00:00:38.629> prime<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:38.989> five

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
means to talk about the 3 prime in five

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.099 
means to talk about the 3 prime in five
prime<00:00:39.499> end<00:00:39.679> in<00:00:39.829> that<00:00:40.010> context<00:00:40.870> there's<00:00:41.870> three

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
prime end in that context there's three

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.680 
prime end in that context there's three
parts<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.530> every<00:00:42.890> nucleotide<00:00:43.449> firstly<00:00:44.449> you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
parts to every nucleotide firstly you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.689 
parts to every nucleotide firstly you
can<00:00:44.719> see<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.199> there's<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.699> most

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
can see that there's this most

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.959 
can see that there's this most
importantly<00:00:47.179> this<00:00:47.480> five<00:00:47.960> carbon<00:00:48.620> sugar

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
importantly this five carbon sugar

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.779 
importantly this five carbon sugar
molecule<00:00:49.969> in<00:00:50.149> this<00:00:50.269> case<00:00:50.449> deoxyribose<00:00:51.789> we'll

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
molecule in this case deoxyribose we'll

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:53.860 
molecule in this case deoxyribose we'll
come<00:00:52.969> back<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.719> moment

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
come back to that in just a moment

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.540 
come back to that in just a moment
there's<00:00:54.859> also<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:57.069> phosphate<00:00:58.069> molecule

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
there's also this phosphate molecule

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.029 
there's also this phosphate molecule
with<00:00:58.819> the<00:00:58.850> with<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.420> yellow<00:00:59.749> phosphorous<00:01:00.379> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
with the with the yellow phosphorous and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.329 
with the with the yellow phosphorous and
the<00:01:01.249> oxygen<00:01:01.729> which<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:01.999> red<00:01:02.499> and<00:01:03.499> then<00:01:03.889> in

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the oxygen which is red and then in

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.880 
the oxygen which is red and then in
addition<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:05.120> there's<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.990> nitrogen

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
addition to that there's a nitrogen

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.240 
addition to that there's a nitrogen
containing<00:01:07.310> base<00:01:07.549> now<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:09.290> nitrogen<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
containing base now the nitrogen in the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.490 
containing base now the nitrogen in the
nitrogen<00:01:10.700> containing<00:01:11.030> base<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.750> blue<00:01:12.229> okay

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
nitrogen containing base is blue okay

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.709 
nitrogen containing base is blue okay
that<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.250> silver<00:01:13.700> bits<00:01:13.880> in<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.210> particular

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
that the silver bits in this particular

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.350 
that the silver bits in this particular
model<00:01:15.710> that<00:01:15.979> we're<00:01:16.130> looking<00:01:16.219> at<00:01:16.490> here<00:01:16.700> are<00:01:16.969> a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
model that we're looking at here are a

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.569 
model that we're looking at here are a
representing<00:01:18.200> carbon<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.159> little<00:01:19.369> white

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
representing carbon and the little white

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.190 
representing carbon and the little white
bits<00:01:19.820> are<00:01:20.000> hydrogen<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:20.899> they're<00:01:21.020> probably

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
bits are hydrogen but they're probably

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
bits are hydrogen but they're probably
less<00:01:21.439> important<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:22.039> so<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> nitrogen

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
less important so so the nitrogen

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.300 
less important so so the nitrogen
containing<00:01:23.719> base<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.409> phosphorus<00:01:25.009> in<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
containing base the phosphorus in the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.649 
containing base the phosphorus in the
phosphate<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.380> then<00:01:28.210> down<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
phosphate and and then down here in the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.910 
phosphate and and then down here in the
middle<00:01:29.960> we've<00:01:30.380> got<00:01:30.409> our<00:01:30.740> five<00:01:30.979> carbon<00:01:31.670> sugar

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
middle we've got our five carbon sugar

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.289 
middle we've got our five carbon sugar
now<00:01:33.920> if<00:01:34.039> you<00:01:34.159> look<00:01:34.369> at<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:34.579> five<00:01:34.789> carbon

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
now if you look at that five carbon

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.539 
now if you look at that five carbon
sugar<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:36.520> we<00:01:37.520> start<00:01:37.789> numbering<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.899> carbons

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
sugar and we start numbering the carbons

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.639 
sugar and we start numbering the carbons
from<00:01:40.549> where<00:01:40.789> they<00:01:41.090> join<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.899> base<00:01:42.109> okay<00:01:42.590> so

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
from where they join the base okay so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.170 
from where they join the base okay so
let's<00:01:43.130> do<00:01:43.219> that<00:01:43.310> I'm<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:43.609> to<00:01:43.640> write<00:01:43.820> this<00:01:44.030> on

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
let's do that I'm going to write this on

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.090 
let's do that I'm going to write this on
here<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:44.869> here's<00:01:45.109> our<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.619> nitrogen

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
here so so here's our and nitrogen

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.169 
here so so here's our and nitrogen
containing<00:01:46.399> base<00:01:46.549> with<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.060> blue

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
containing base with all the blue

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.910 
containing base with all the blue
nitrogen<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:47.840> it<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.380> would<00:01:48.530> make<00:01:48.710> this

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
nitrogen in it that would make this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.730 
nitrogen in it that would make this
carbon<00:01:49.399> number<00:01:49.640> one<00:01:50.329> this<00:01:51.140> one<00:01:51.350> here<00:01:51.649> is

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
carbon number one this one here is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.609 
carbon number one this one here is
carbon<00:01:52.039> number<00:01:52.340> two<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:54.140> would<00:01:54.320> make<00:01:54.469> this

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
carbon number two that would make this

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.950 
carbon number two that would make this
one<00:01:54.679> carbon<00:01:55.219> three<00:01:55.609> this<00:01:56.030> one's<00:01:56.270> carbon<00:01:56.689> four

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.969 
other top is carbon number five now
you'll<00:02:02.479> notice<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.020> phosphate<00:02:03.770> is

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
you'll notice that the phosphate is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.029 
you'll notice that the phosphate is
attached<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.210> carbon<00:02:05.810> number<00:02:05.840> five<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.649> that

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
attached to carbon number five and that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.130 
attached to carbon number five and that
gives<00:02:07.280> us<00:02:07.490> our<00:02:07.670> five<00:02:08.270> prime<00:02:08.660> end<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:09.020> this

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
gives us our five prime end of this

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.920 
gives us our five prime end of this
nucleotide<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:10.460> three<00:02:10.880> prime<00:02:11.210> end<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.659> where

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
nucleotide the three prime end is where

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.229 
nucleotide the three prime end is where
this<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.560> hydroxyl<00:02:13.340> group<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.000> is

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
this this hydroxyl group is this is

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.780 
this this hydroxyl group is this is
oxygen<00:02:14.569> with<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> hydrogen<00:02:15.409> on<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.099> our

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
oxygen with a hydrogen on it that's our

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
oxygen with a hydrogen on it that's our
prime<00:02:17.120> end<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:18.170> it's<00:02:18.319> attached<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
prime end because it's attached to the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.490 
prime end because it's attached to the
third<00:02:19.519> carbon<00:02:19.879> does<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.629> make<00:02:20.780> sense<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.349> we

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
third carbon does that make sense if we

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.059 
third carbon does that make sense if we
look<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:24.230> polymer<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.799> these

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
look at a and a polymer of these

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.099 
look at a and a polymer of these
nucleotides<00:02:25.700> because<00:02:25.909> remember<00:02:26.120> DNA<00:02:26.629> is<00:02:26.689> a<00:02:26.840> is

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
nucleotides because remember DNA is a is

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.880 
nucleotides because remember DNA is a is
a<00:02:27.189> long<00:02:28.189> chain<00:02:28.219> of<00:02:28.909> nucleotides<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.409> polymer<00:02:30.859> of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
a long chain of nucleotides a polymer of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.339 
a long chain of nucleotides a polymer of
nucleotides<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.760> if<00:02:32.269> we<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.540> at<00:02:32.659> this<00:02:32.810> you

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
nucleotides so if we look at this you

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.869 
nucleotides so if we look at this you
can<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.680> that<00:02:33.890> obviously<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:34.489> would<00:02:34.640> be<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
can see that obviously this would be the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.920 
can see that obviously this would be the
5<00:02:35.150> prime<00:02:35.569> end<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.109> that<00:02:36.829> nucleotide<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:38.720> this

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
5 prime end of that nucleotide then this

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.589 
5 prime end of that nucleotide then this
here<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.379> 3<00:02:39.620> prime<00:02:39.920> end<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:41.090> phosphate

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
here is the 3 prime end that phosphate

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.649 
here is the 3 prime end that phosphate
there<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:41.989> attached<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.560> 5<00:02:42.799> prime<00:02:43.159> end

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
there is attached to the 5 prime end

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.839 
there is attached to the 5 prime end
there's<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.780> 3<00:02:45.049> prime<00:02:45.260> end<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.069> 5<00:02:46.280> prime<00:02:46.609> end

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
there's a 3 prime end is the 5 prime end

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.300 
there's a 3 prime end is the 5 prime end
of<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.359> next<00:02:47.569> one<00:02:47.719> and<00:02:47.900> then<00:02:48.469> sticking<00:02:49.099> down

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
of the next one and then sticking down

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.099 
of the next one and then sticking down
the<00:02:49.430> bottom<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.030> 3<00:02:50.269> prime<00:02:50.510> end<00:02:50.540> which

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
the bottom here is the 3 prime end which

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.580 
the bottom here is the 3 prime end which
gives<00:02:51.379> us<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.760> 3<00:02:52.760> prime<00:02:53.180> end<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.319> whole

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
gives us the 3 prime end of that whole

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.309 
gives us the 3 prime end of that whole
chain<00:02:54.889> so<00:02:55.069> we<00:02:55.099> would<00:02:55.310> say<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.669> whole

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
chain so we would say that this whole

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.970 
chain so we would say that this whole
this<00:02:57.319> whole<00:02:57.400> chain<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.669> nucleotides<00:02:59.980> this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
this whole chain of nucleotides this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.849 
this whole chain of nucleotides this
strand<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.549> DNA<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> 5<00:03:03.079> prime<00:03:03.470> end<00:03:03.680> of

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
strand of DNA this is the 5 prime end of

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.330 
strand of DNA this is the 5 prime end of
it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.099> that's<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.090> 3<00:03:05.569> prime<00:03:05.870> end<00:03:06.169> of<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.769> just

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
it and that's the 3 prime end of it just

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.710 
it and that's the 3 prime end of it just
going<00:03:07.549> back<00:03:07.700> before<00:03:07.849> we<00:03:08.090> leave<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.419> well<00:03:08.599> we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
going back before we leave is well we

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720 
going back before we leave is well we
have<00:03:08.750> such<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> nice<00:03:09.560> diagram<00:03:09.859> of<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> nucleotide

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
have such a nice diagram of a nucleotide

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.470 
have such a nice diagram of a nucleotide
on<00:03:11.150> here

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
on here

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.270 
on here
I<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.720> also<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.470> want<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.650> point<00:03:12.829> out<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.159> you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
I do also just want to point out to you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.399 
I do also just want to point out to you
when<00:03:14.030> we're<00:03:14.180> looking<00:03:14.269> at<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.689> bases<00:03:15.139> here

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
when we're looking at the bases here

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.729 
when we're looking at the bases here
that<00:03:16.370> remember<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.090> we<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:17.959> tell<00:03:18.169> which<00:03:18.409> base

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
that remember and we can tell which base

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.219 
that remember and we can tell which base
this<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.419> by<00:03:20.419> looking<00:03:20.510> at<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> couple<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.079> things

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
this is by looking at a couple of things

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.420 
this is by looking at a couple of things
specially<00:03:21.650> there's<00:03:21.829> a<00:03:21.889> couple<00:03:22.099> of<00:03:22.280> places

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
specially there's a couple of places

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.659 
specially there's a couple of places
where<00:03:22.849> hydrogen<00:03:23.419> bonds<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:23.930> can<00:03:24.139> form<00:03:24.669> two

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
where hydrogen bonds here can form two

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.909 
where hydrogen bonds here can form two
of<00:03:25.849> them<00:03:26.060> because<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:26.959> two<00:03:27.260> hydrogen

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
of them because there are two hydrogen

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.680 
of them because there are two hydrogen
bonds<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.430> form<00:03:28.699> that<00:03:28.879> would<00:03:29.000> mean<00:03:29.269> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
bonds that can form that would mean that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.939 
bonds that can form that would mean that
this<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:30.049> either<00:03:30.260> adenine<00:03:31.040> or<00:03:31.310> thymine<00:03:32.829> if<00:03:33.829> it

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
this is either adenine or thymine if it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.379 
this is either adenine or thymine if it
was<00:03:34.069> cytosine<00:03:34.549> or<00:03:34.639> guanine<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.239> would<00:03:35.359> be

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
was cytosine or guanine there would be

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.569 
was cytosine or guanine there would be
three<00:03:36.019> places<00:03:36.349> where<00:03:36.680> hydrogen<00:03:37.250> bonds<00:03:37.549> can

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
three places where hydrogen bonds can

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.750 
three places where hydrogen bonds can
form<00:03:38.889> okay<00:03:39.889> so<00:03:39.949> how<00:03:40.099> do<00:03:40.159> we<00:03:40.250> tell<00:03:40.459> whether<00:03:40.489> it's

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
form okay so how do we tell whether it's

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.219 
form okay so how do we tell whether it's
at<00:03:40.849> an<00:03:41.030> angle<00:03:41.120> thymine<00:03:41.659> will<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.930> remember

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
at an angle thymine will you remember

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.659 
at an angle thymine will you remember
that<00:03:43.690> some<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:45.019> bases<00:03:45.409> have<00:03:45.799> two<00:03:46.129> rings<00:03:46.459> in

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
that some of the bases have two rings in

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.280 
that some of the bases have two rings in
them<00:03:46.819> like<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.120> one<00:03:47.329> does<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.930> see<00:03:48.109> there's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
them like this one does and see there's

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.800 
them like this one does and see there's
one<00:03:48.440> R<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.680> there<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.159> one<00:03:49.639> ring<00:03:49.909> here<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.419> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
one R in there and one ring here and the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.449 
one R in there and one ring here and the
ones<00:03:50.989> with<00:03:51.169> two<00:03:51.379> rings<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:51.919> we<00:03:52.250> call

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
ones with two rings like that we call

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.479 
ones with two rings like that we call
purines<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.959> ones<00:03:54.199> that<00:03:54.409> have<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> single<00:03:55.010> ring

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
purines the ones that have a single ring

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.379 
purines the ones that have a single ring
we<00:03:56.030> call<00:03:56.500> pyrimidine<00:03:57.500> z'<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:59.180> might

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
we call pyrimidine z' and you might

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.280 
we call pyrimidine z' and you might
remember<00:03:59.569> that<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.349> bases<00:04:00.889> see<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.659> T

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
remember that the bases see you and T

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.000 
remember that the bases see you and T
are<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:04.609> pyrimidine<00:04:05.569> this<00:04:06.290> one<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.680> course<00:04:06.709> is

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
are the pyrimidine this one of course is

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.739 
are the pyrimidine this one of course is
adenine<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.659> must<00:04:08.989> be<00:04:09.169> a<00:04:09.349> purine<00:04:09.849> okay<00:04:11.739> see
