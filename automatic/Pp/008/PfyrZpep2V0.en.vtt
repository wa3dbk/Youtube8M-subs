break you're seeing it with you know we

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.779 
break you're seeing it with you know we
have<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.199> parking<00:05:29.069> brake<00:05:29.159> for<00:05:29.370> example<00:05:29.699> it's

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
have a parking brake for example it's

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.510 
have a parking brake for example it's
motorized<00:05:30.270> there's<00:05:30.870> no<00:05:31.050> cable<00:05:31.860> if<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.310> will

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
motorized there's no cable if you will

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.540 
motorized there's no cable if you will
for<00:05:32.729> that<00:05:32.879> flip<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.539> switch<00:05:33.569> motor<00:05:34.319> locks<00:05:34.650> on<00:05:34.919> so

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
for that flip a switch motor locks on so

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.790 
for that flip a switch motor locks on so
and<00:05:35.969> you<00:05:36.509> know<00:05:36.539> you<00:05:36.690> if<00:05:37.139> you<00:05:37.319> want<00:05:37.500> to<00:05:37.529> look<00:05:37.680> at

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
and you know you if you want to look at

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.200 
and you know you if you want to look at
race<00:05:37.979> that<00:05:38.159> we<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.610> look<00:05:38.729> at<00:05:38.879> racing

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
race that we like to look at racing

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.369 
race that we like to look at racing
because<00:05:39.360> we<00:05:39.479> think<00:05:39.659> if<00:05:39.810> it's<00:05:39.930> good<00:05:40.110> enough<00:05:40.139> to

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
because we think if it's good enough to

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:42.409 
because we think if it's good enough to
race<00:05:40.680> in<00:05:40.949> it's<00:05:41.310> probably<00:05:41.759> good<00:05:41.909> enough<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.240> put

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
race in it's probably good enough to put

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.189 
race in it's probably good enough to put
on<00:05:42.539> your<00:05:42.690> cars<00:05:43.009> you<00:05:44.009> know<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.190> look<00:05:44.610> at<00:05:44.839> the<00:05:45.839> f1

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
on your cars you know you look at the f1

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.189 
on your cars you know you look at the f1
cars<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:47.009> know<00:05:47.099> those<00:05:47.250> are<00:05:47.370> brake<00:05:47.520> by<00:05:47.669> wire

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
cars you know those are brake by wire

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.110 
cars you know those are brake by wire
there's<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.259> backup<00:05:49.680> systems<00:05:50.129> yeah<00:05:50.339> so<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:50.879> mean

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
there's a backup systems yeah so I mean

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.149 
there's a backup systems yeah so I mean
there's<00:05:51.419> there's<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.020> lot<00:05:52.289> of<00:05:52.409> electronics<00:05:53.009> in

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:53.159 
there's there's a lot of electronics in

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:56.629 
there's there's a lot of electronics in
those<00:05:53.310> vehicles<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:56.370> know<00:05:56.460> they're

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
those vehicles and you know they're

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.279 
those vehicles and you know they're
different<00:05:56.819> components<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:57.690> as<00:05:57.870> they<00:05:58.050> as<00:05:58.259> they

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
different components and as they as they

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.260 
different components and as they as they
move<00:05:58.650> more<00:05:58.949> and<00:05:58.979> more<00:05:59.339> and<00:05:59.550> closer<00:05:59.789> and<00:06:00.029> closer

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
move more and more and closer and closer

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.600 
move more and more and closer and closer
to<00:06:00.839> full<00:06:01.169> brake<00:06:01.469> by<00:06:01.680> wire<00:06:01.889> there's<00:06:02.189> different

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
to full brake by wire there's different

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.550 
to full brake by wire there's different
areas<00:06:02.789> you<00:06:03.270> know<00:06:03.509> where<00:06:03.719> you<00:06:03.810> see<00:06:03.960> electronics

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
areas you know where you see electronics

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.850 
areas you know where you see electronics
is<00:06:04.710> coming<00:06:05.009> into<00:06:05.129> play<00:06:06.439> you're<00:06:07.439> gonna<00:06:07.500> see<00:06:07.770> it

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
is coming into play you're gonna see it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.499 
is coming into play you're gonna see it
in<00:06:07.949> normal<00:06:08.159> vehicles<00:06:08.639> what's<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.270> advantage

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
in normal vehicles what's the advantage

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.959 
in normal vehicles what's the advantage
of<00:06:09.839> brake<00:06:10.169> by<00:06:10.349> wire<00:06:10.620> is<00:06:11.039> it<00:06:11.219> just<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.639> weight

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
of brake by wire is it just the weight

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.999 
of brake by wire is it just the weight
of<00:06:12.000> a<00:06:12.270> hydraulic<00:06:12.839> system<00:06:13.050> you're<00:06:13.500> replacing

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
of a hydraulic system you're replacing

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.950 
of a hydraulic system you're replacing
that<00:06:14.099> largely<00:06:14.490> with<00:06:14.759> a<00:06:14.789> wire<00:06:15.000> well<00:06:15.419> number<00:06:15.750> one

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
that largely with a wire well number one

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.320 
that largely with a wire well number one
is<00:06:16.229> you<00:06:16.500> lose<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:16.979> hydraulic<00:06:17.520> system<00:06:17.879> you

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
is you lose the hydraulic system you

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.360 
is you lose the hydraulic system you
know<00:06:18.479> so<00:06:18.839> now<00:06:19.169> will<00:06:19.349> you<00:06:19.469> lose<00:06:19.680> it<00:06:19.830> immediately

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
know so now will you lose it immediately

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.579 
know so now will you lose it immediately
I<00:06:20.550> doubt<00:06:21.360> it<00:06:21.569> it's<00:06:21.839> probably<00:06:22.110> similar<00:06:22.319> to

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:22.589 
I doubt it it's probably similar to

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:23.719 
I doubt it it's probably similar to
airplanes<00:06:23.009> you<00:06:23.219> know<00:06:23.310> where<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:23.520> have

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
airplanes you know where you have

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.159 
airplanes you know where you have
electronics<00:06:24.659> you'll<00:06:24.810> have<00:06:24.960> backup

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
electronics you'll have backup

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.559 
electronics you'll have backup
hydraulics<00:06:25.949> but<00:06:26.490> at<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.729> end<00:06:26.759> of<00:06:26.969> the<00:06:27.029> day<00:06:27.210> the

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
hydraulics but at the end of the day the

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.899 
hydraulics but at the end of the day the
responsiveness<00:06:28.319> also<00:06:29.189> you're<00:06:29.490> gonna<00:06:29.580> be<00:06:29.729> able

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
responsiveness also you're gonna be able

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.850 
responsiveness also you're gonna be able
to<00:06:29.969> integrate<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.599> again<00:06:30.990> right<00:06:31.289> into<00:06:31.560> your

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
to integrate it again right into your

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.279 
to integrate it again right into your
into<00:06:32.460> your<00:06:32.490> electronics<00:06:33.180> in<00:06:33.270> your<00:06:33.419> system<00:06:33.810> so

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
into your electronics in your system so

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.730 
into your electronics in your system so
you<00:06:35.129> know<00:06:35.250> you'll<00:06:35.490> be<00:06:35.669> able<00:06:35.789> to<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.210> want<00:06:36.740> what
