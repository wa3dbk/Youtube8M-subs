00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bigger we've tried new systems to handle

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
bigger we've tried new systems to handle
the<00:00:34.560> literally<00:00:35.130> thousands<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> challenges

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but this year we're introducing a new

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
but this year we're introducing a new
system<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.810> it<00:00:39.930> easier<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
system to make it easier for you to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.720 
system to make it easier for you to
submit<00:00:40.890> an<00:00:41.730> easier<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.180> us<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> achieve<00:00:43.730> but

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
submit an easier for us to achieve but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
submit an easier for us to achieve but
how<00:00:44.880> you<00:00:44.940> ask<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.870> challenges<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.649> free<00:00:47.840> so

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
how's that going to work well rather

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.620 
how's that going to work well rather
than<00:00:50.610> last<00:00:50.820> time<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.300> open<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630

and then desperately try to work through

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.360 
and then desperately try to work through

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
less time we spend on challenge

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.469 
less time we spend on challenge
administration<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
administration the more time we can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.380 
administration the more time we can
spend<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.869> challenge<00:01:40.259> performance<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:42.180> wait

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
spend on challenge performance but wait

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
spend on challenge performance but wait
what<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.200> want<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.890> really

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
what if you want to do something really

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.460 
what if you want to do something really
big<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.700> make<00:01:45.299> Matt<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.869> twilight<00:01:46.020> or

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
big like make Matt go see twilight or

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
big like make Matt go see twilight or
have<00:01:46.590> Kathleen<00:01:47.009> dance<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.520> half<00:01:47.640> an<00:01:47.790> hour<00:01:47.880> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
have Kathleen dance for half an hour but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
have Kathleen dance for half an hour but
we<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.720> still<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:49.140> crowdsource<00:01:49.799> group

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we can still do crowdsource group

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
we can still do crowdsource group
challenges<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.360> cool<00:01:51.750> come

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
challenges if we see something cool come

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
challenges if we see something cool come
up<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> set<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> group<00:01:53.369> challenge

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
up we can set it up as a group challenge

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
up we can set it up as a group challenge
and<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.479> enough<00:01:54.689> money<00:01:54.869> comes<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.229> for

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and that if enough money comes in for

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
and that if enough money comes in for
that<00:01:55.500> specific<00:01:55.680> thing<00:01:56.130> we'll<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that specific thing we'll do it just

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
that specific thing we'll do it just
like<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.150> done<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> previous<00:01:57.570> years<00:01:58.100> but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
like we have done in previous years but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 
like we have done in previous years but
wait<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.369> further<00:02:00.000> hear<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.540> say<00:02:00.810> you're<00:02:01.409> not

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
wait I further hear you say you're not

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.660 
wait I further hear you say you're not
doing<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:01.979> challenge<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.490> I've<00:02:02.549> been

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
doing my challenge and I've been

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.010 
doing my challenge and I've been
watching<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.149> day<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.689> doing<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
watching all day but you are doing a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
watching all day but you are doing a
challenge<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.500> Bob<00:02:04.710> who<00:02:04.920> hasn't<00:02:05.189> been

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
challenge for Bob who hasn't been

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
challenge for Bob who hasn't been
watching<00:02:05.610> since<00:02:05.759> Tuesday<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> case

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
watching since Tuesday not the case

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.449 
watching since Tuesday not the case
because<00:02:07.470> every<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:07.920> often<00:02:08.069> we're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
because every so often we're going to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.130 
because every so often we're going to
purge<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.970> system<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> keep<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.689> challenges

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
purge the system to keep the challenges

purge the system to keep the challenges
fresh<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.919> may<00:02:11.129> mean<00:02:11.309> that<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.609> need<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
fresh this may mean that you need to

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.429 
fresh this may mean that you need to
resubmit<00:02:12.299> your<00:02:12.480> challenge<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.319> it's

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
resubmit your challenge but it's

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.959 
resubmit your challenge but it's
actually<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.040> likely<00:02:14.309> to<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.819> done

this<00:02:16.500> all<00:02:16.680> means<00:02:16.860> less<00:02:17.069> finagling<00:02:17.400> waiting

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
this all means less finagling waiting

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.369
