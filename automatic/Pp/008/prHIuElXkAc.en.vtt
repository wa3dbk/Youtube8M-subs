00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.070
 hello and welcome to this online course 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.070
 Free to learn to knit 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.349
 in this chapter chapter 3 we are going to 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 learn to realize points of law and 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.340
 points of the reverse 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 the point of the right is the easiest to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.560
 learn and it's the first one that we're going to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 practice with the points already mounted on 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.200
 the needle and with the needle in your hand 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 left we insert the needle of the hand 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.030
 right in the center of the first point 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 with the wool that comes from the ball is made 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.879
 a loop around the needle that we have 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.230
 inserted then we take out the needle 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.840
 hooking that thread that we have put 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.840
 new thus making a new point 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.350
 without power 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.870
 In your side 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 was born here in me 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 m 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.270
 the nightgown 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 riki 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.640
 here they followed 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.320
 maybe not 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.290
 the hesperides 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.740
 if we repeat this kind of point many 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.260
 Sometimes we will get a knitted fabric 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.260
 bobo this is how it is called 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 annan 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.360
 after the point of the right the point 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.270
 upside down is the most used we place 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.030
 the wool that comes from the ball by the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.610
 front of the needle and the part 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.710
 front of the work we insert the 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.520
 needle of the right hand in the center 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.190
 of the needle point left by the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.190
 front with the next wool 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.070
 of the ball we make a loop on the needle 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.850
 that we just inserted then we will take out 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.510
 the needle with the thread forming a new 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.510
 point 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.410
 l 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.030
 Y 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.680
 i 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 good 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 2 is here 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.560
 and not 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.420
 I 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.420
 I was 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.460
 truths 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.970
 do not 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.970
 here you have six 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.310
 we can start practicing with these 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.330
 basic points once we have 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.680
 dominated the basic points 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.960
 exchanging those is making a 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.360
 right point one point upside down and 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.960
 doing several conjugations we are going to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.450
 get different types of tissues like 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.200
 for example the jersey point or the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.200
 mud point 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.780
 to me 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.050
