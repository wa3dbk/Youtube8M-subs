so it's not necessarily the masses but
just<00:01:57.729> spreading<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> word<00:01:58.240> start

good<00:01:59.479> question<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.930> know<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.229> mean<00:02:00.470> because<00:02:00.710> a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
good question I know you mean because a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.219 
good question I know you mean because a
lot<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:00.950> my<00:02:01.040> mates<00:02:01.250> they're<00:02:02.149> not<00:02:02.329> as<00:02:02.540> into<00:02:03.200> it

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
lot of my mates they're not as into it

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.640 
lot of my mates they're not as into it
as<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.649> am<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:03.829> I<00:02:03.979> think<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.250> just<00:02:04.280> takes<00:02:04.549> time

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
as I am but I think it just takes time

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.320 
as I am but I think it just takes time
probably<00:02:06.650> more<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.010> when<00:02:07.280> if<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.610> have<00:02:07.909> brands

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
probably more so when if you have brands

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.520 
probably more so when if you have brands
which<00:02:08.509> offer<00:02:08.720> things<00:02:08.990> which<00:02:09.259> are<00:02:09.410> very

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
which offer things which are very

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.890 
which offer things which are very
down-to-earth<00:02:10.280> impractical<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.810> they

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
down-to-earth impractical so that they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900 
down-to-earth impractical so that they
can<00:02:12.080> actually<00:02:12.110> feel<00:02:12.709> baking<00:02:13.400> where<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.730> rather

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
can actually feel baking where it rather

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.790 
can actually feel baking where it rather
