different approach
what<00:01:55.970> we<00:01:56.060> did<00:01:56.240> was<00:01:56.390> we<00:01:56.540> took<00:01:56.720> two<00:01:57.080> killer

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
what we did was we took two killer

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.830 
what we did was we took two killer
shells<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.220> we<00:01:58.280> mounted<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.700> maple<00:01:59.030> shell<00:01:59.270> mix

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
shells and we mounted a maple shell mix

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.660 
shells and we mounted a maple shell mix
with<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> mahogany<00:02:00.380> shell<00:02:00.830> we<00:02:01.100> call<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.400> apply

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
with a mahogany shell we call it apply

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.700 
with a mahogany shell we call it apply
for<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:01.940> that's<00:02:02.660> kind<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:02.990> interesting<00:02:03.440> so<00:02:03.650> you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
for it that's kind of interesting so you

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.510 
for it that's kind of interesting so you
get<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.070> up<00:02:05.080> rather<00:02:06.080> than<00:02:06.350> mixing<00:02:06.980> up<00:02:07.280> flies

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
get you up rather than mixing up flies

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.920 
get you up rather than mixing up flies
you<00:02:07.910> actually<00:02:08.300> have<00:02:08.440> married<00:02:09.440> two<00:02:09.710> shelves

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
you actually have married two shelves

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.600 
you actually have married two shelves
correct<00:02:11.930> yeah<00:02:12.230> Mary<00:02:12.590> -<00:02:12.800> she'll<00:02:13.010> see<00:02:13.160> you've

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
correct yeah Mary - she'll see you've

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.030 
correct yeah Mary - she'll see you've
got<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.910> densest<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.960> beautiful<00:02:15.890> tone

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
got the densest the the beautiful tone

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.820 
got the densest the the beautiful tone
of<00:02:16.160> maple<00:02:16.490> mix<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.940> lower<00:02:17.830> lower

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
of maple mix with the lower lower

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.770 
of maple mix with the lower lower
resonating<00:02:19.310> tones<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.730> mahogany<00:02:20.540> makes

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
resonating tones of the mahogany makes

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.540 
resonating tones of the mahogany makes
in<00:02:20.930> one<00:02:21.110> drum<00:02:21.350> she'll<00:02:21.590> hit<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:22.190> scene<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.520> a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
in one drum she'll hit the scene with a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.710 
in one drum she'll hit the scene with a
nice<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> thing<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:32.209> noticed<00:02:32.540> was

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
nice is the thing that we noticed was

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
nice is the thing that we noticed was
was<00:02:33.620> impacted<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> most<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.700> drums<00:02:34.940> for

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
was impacted the most the drums for

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.180 
was impacted the most the drums for
seven<00:02:35.420> very<00:02:35.690> long<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.650> know<00:02:36.709> decay<00:02:37.070> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
seven very long you know decay and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.410 
seven very long you know decay and
sustain

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
sustain

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.770 
sustain
okay<00:02:39.930> where<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:41.700> are<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.210> done<00:02:42.330> right<00:02:42.600> here

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
okay where to now are we done right here

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.280 
okay where to now are we done right here
okay<00:02:43.730> right<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.110> they

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
okay right here this is something they

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
okay right here this is something they
thought<00:02:46.440> was<00:02:46.500> pretty<00:02:46.770> cool

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
thought was pretty cool

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.309 
thought was pretty cool
we<00:02:47.850> call<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> fly<00:02:48.480> cast<00:02:48.750> -<00:02:48.930> it's

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
we call this the fly cast - it's

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.800 
we call this the fly cast - it's
actually<00:02:49.440> would<00:02:49.860> hope<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.310> weave<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.600> lay

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
actually would hope that we weave in lay

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.390 
actually would hope that we weave in lay
these<00:02:51.990> little<00:02:52.290> grommets<00:02:52.770> here<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.069> hold<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
these little grommets here to hold the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.580 
these little grommets here to hold the
the<00:02:53.940> tip<00:02:54.120> throughout<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> place<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> cool

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the tip throughout the place what a cool

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.970 
the tip throughout the place what a cool
idea

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
idea

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.690 
idea
yeah<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:57.060> drum<00:02:57.270> set<00:02:57.300> also<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> has<00:02:57.959> external

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
yeah this drum set also it has external

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.460 
yeah this drum set also it has external
reinforcements<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.360> give<00:03:00.480> risers<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.320> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
reinforcements to give risers to it so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
reinforcements to give risers to it so
that<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.860> actually<00:03:02.040> make<00:03:02.880> more<00:03:03.090> hoops<00:03:03.300> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that we can actually make more hoops to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.620 
that we can actually make more hoops to
fit<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.870> drum<00:03:04.730> yeah<00:03:05.730> over<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.330> fourth

bright bright tone with the carbon fiber

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.520 
bright bright tone with the carbon fiber
