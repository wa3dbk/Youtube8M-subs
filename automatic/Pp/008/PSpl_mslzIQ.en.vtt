00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
simulation where you're in a c-130 so

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.130 
simulation where you're in a c-130 so
what<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.240> look<00:00:18.810> for<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
pass what's he until they are dark they

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.280 
pass what's he until they are dark they
have<00:00:26.460> no<00:00:26.609> heat<00:00:26.849> signature

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:44.310 

let<00:00:33.010> me<00:00:33.070> just<00:00:33.250> zoom<00:00:33.310> in<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.870> some<00:00:44.020> more<00:00:44.170> of
