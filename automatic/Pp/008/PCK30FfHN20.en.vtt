your<00:03:32.480> child's<00:03:32.990> thoughts<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.650> you're

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
your child's thoughts and you're

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.060 
your child's thoughts and you're
essentially<00:03:34.700> recording<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:36.410> in<00:03:36.740> writing

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
essentially recording them in writing

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
essentially recording them in writing
for<00:03:37.820> him<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.150> said<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.780> beginning

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
for him and like I said in the beginning

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.920 
for him and like I said in the beginning
you<00:03:44.090> are<00:03:44.510> doing<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.900> writing<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.770> as<00:03:46.750> his<00:03:47.750> or

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
her skills improve they can take over to

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.160 
her skills improve they can take over to
the<00:03:50.780> point<00:03:51.020> where<00:03:51.940> hopefully<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.570> goal<00:03:53.750> is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the point where hopefully the goal is

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.800 
the point where hopefully the goal is
always<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.830> they<00:03:55.220> no<00:03:55.400> longer<00:03:55.430> need<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810

a three-hole punch and a three-ring

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.180 
a three-hole punch and a three-ring
binder<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.820> do<00:04:26.940> that<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:28.860> just<00:04:28.980> like

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
to say here I think that's it the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.110 
to say here I think that's it the
benefits<00:04:37.050> yes<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.920> benefits<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
benefits yes the benefits of the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.630 
benefits yes the benefits of the
activity<00:04:39.720> well<00:04:40.440> there's<00:04:40.680> many<00:04:40.920> benefits<00:04:41.040> of

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
activity well there's many benefits of

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.610 
activity well there's many benefits of
this<00:04:41.790> activity<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:42.570> think<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.230> number<00:04:43.590> one

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
this activity but I think the number one

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.610 
this activity but I think the number one
benefit<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:45.870> a<00:04:46.140> great

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
benefit is is that it's a great

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.180 
benefit is is that it's a great
