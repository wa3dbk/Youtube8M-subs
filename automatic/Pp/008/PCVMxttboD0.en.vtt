I've got a leak on the rear cylinders on
the<00:03:25.459> brain<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.060> it's<00:03:26.930> gonna<00:03:27.050> need<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> brake<00:03:27.530> job

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
the brain so it's gonna need a brake job

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.370 
the brain so it's gonna need a brake job
okay<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.940> needs<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.180> minor<00:03:29.390> brake<00:03:29.660> job<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.290> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
okay so it needs a minor brake job and a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.780 
okay so it needs a minor brake job and a
little<00:03:30.590> bit<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.830> wiring<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.490> thing<00:03:31.670> can

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
little bit of wiring and this thing can

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.400 
little bit of wiring and this thing can
be<00:03:31.910> back<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.450> road<00:03:32.480> running<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.110> dry<00:03:33.230> that

be back on the road running and dry that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.870 
be back on the road running and dry that
is<00:03:33.560> correct<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.340> that's<00:03:34.490> why<00:03:34.730> they're

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
is correct and that's why they're

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.880
