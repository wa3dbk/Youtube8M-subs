00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.760
 Well, we'll get to the point first thing 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.120
 we need is to have a partition or 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.419
 hard drive to decompress what 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.320
 which are the isos that we are going to generate 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:17.570
 then we will take and with the xbox backup 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.869
 predator what we are going to do is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.170
 execute it go to images tools in addition 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.810
 for being then we will open directly 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.929
 the iso that we want that we want 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.840
 use in this case is on the disk 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.670
 hard h ideal sega rally we give to open 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.130
 and all the files appear here 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.520
 that they have with all the folders what 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.950
 we will do it will be right button extract and we 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 we will go to the hard drive where 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.020
 we want to extract files in this case 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.470
 360 and here we are going to create a folder that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 is going to call x inside that folder 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.480
 in this case 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.100
 I will sew him 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.100
 we will give it to ok and start the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.719
 extraction 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's see a moment that ends the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 extraction 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 well once it's finished but before 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.979
 before we have to make sure when 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.399
 let's extract the file to do it 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 directly on the root of what is 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.780
 the iso would be about the name of the iso 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.429
 right button to extract this we have to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 taken into account once it has 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.600
 finished extracting we can close it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.689
 we closed the program 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.049
 and we would go to what is the ex 360 game 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.049
 so that we execute we select 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.340
 the folder the folder of the games 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.230
 we can do so if we have several the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.870
 is going to patch all not for one then 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.210
 as we get out of the program is already 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.880
 it removes the sub from the restrictions of 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.700
 the regions and others 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 at the moment no order is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.189
 problem so you can do so 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.439
 now simply put or select 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.230
 directly the folder where you have the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.330
 games you give a fix 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.260
 but it's a moment because 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 the patches 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.270
 depending on the size of the file the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.000
 point it takes more or less you see here already 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.520
 we see that you have created all the folders 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.370
 within game and you have patched a file 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.709
 in that moment you can start 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.140
 use the game but first of all 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.569
 let's go into what is the folder 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 of the game or between games that when 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.600
 we read decompressed inside that claw 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 li and we see here the update system that 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.290
 what we are going to do is erase it 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.220
 this folder and so we make sure that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.850
 will not try to update the system 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.290
 here we have the original sex and 6 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.300
 patched and here we have sex 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.190
 original, maybe we had to 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.140
 restore the copy at this time already 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.240
 we can click the hard drive in the xbox 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.250
 Y 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.190
 with the sex loader or any other 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.510
 we use we should welcome and do 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.520
 operate the games in the kind of 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.350
 problem remember that they are copies of 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.510
 security about games that 6 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.890
 there is another way that is for games 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.960
 that do not work for you in this way 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.300
 some of the games are not capable of 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.330
 see them with this program then 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.760
 we can use the extra csis or this 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.830
 another is just as simple to use you 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.420
 We indicate the folder we indicate the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.790
 folder but we do not put the name of 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.190
 folder to the game because because the same 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.080
 name of the notice will be used as 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.060
 the folder name then here is 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.300
 as easy as giving it to add a notice to 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.350
 aniston we will choose to become real and in 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.380
 this case 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.040
 and it appears to us already here at this moment already 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.350
 it is simply to have this disabled the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.530
 copy the system where is what we have 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.030
 deleted before and we give go in the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.770
 moment in which we give to something will be able 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.200
 unzip it and exactly like 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.840
 the other on the same folder then 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.390
 with that we have the two more alternatives 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.370
 simple to extract our games 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.700
 the isos that we have created from our 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.700
 originals to what would be the folder that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.959
 will interpret the console later to 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.370
 not have to put the disk back 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.430
 original that is not scratched and so on 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.430
 etc
