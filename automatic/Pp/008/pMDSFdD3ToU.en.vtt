 Tecnam nourishes functioning of rai3 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.150
 original 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 so what do you have to do first? 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.310
 let's go to his technician 3 and keep this 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 open window then we go in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
 description that there will be a rapid file 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.640
 download and you will find this archive 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.340
 right click here and it will come out 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 this folder technam huteleac inside 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 this sign there will be some files 3 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 fighters and to be exact we would have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 believe me you can read it if you want 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.170
 but only read is the same thing I will tell you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 I'm in English 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.180
 then we will have the informed dlle 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 an application that injects lac that is the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.649
 start then if in case 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.020
 the sail application to be reported as the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.460
 virus but you can add to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 exceptions because it is not a virus 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 it simply needs to edit files 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 within the game you find in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.160
 part of the system and therefore considers it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.090
 virus but don't worry it doesn't 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.159
 anything 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.560
 we are ready to open the game with 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.790
 but we first activate p3 mood dl 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.159
 the inter will present this small window 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.820
 this one with red lettering 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 etc 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.100
 first of all we do select dll and vi 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.610
 you should open a window with one 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.080
 the only option available this is not the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 double click and see that this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.490
 writing will turn green now is it anyway 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 red and we can't activate it because 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.670
 do n't open it while we have to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.680
 while doing it first while I hope that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.250
 sing xi and registers you make it possible 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.250
 of green lettering 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.770
