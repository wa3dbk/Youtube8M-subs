00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
users if we take the hero

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.180 
users if we take the hero
for<00:04:27.150> example<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:28.350> see<00:04:28.500> right<00:04:28.680> away<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.890> we

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
for example the see right away that we

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.280 
for example the see right away that we
have<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.790> only<00:04:30.090> supreme<00:04:30.419> FX<00:04:30.660> solution<00:04:31.140> now

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
have the only supreme FX solution now

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.500 
have the only supreme FX solution now
this<00:04:31.470> solution<00:04:31.770> actually<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.910> implemented

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
this solution actually was implemented

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.850 
this solution actually was implemented
on<00:04:33.630> every<00:04:33.930> single<00:04:34.080> motherboard<00:04:34.470> from<00:04:34.710> the

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
on every single motherboard from the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.890 
on every single motherboard from the
gene<00:04:35.040> all<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.340> way<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.700> extreme<00:04:36.120> so

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
gene all the way to the extreme so

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.840 
gene all the way to the extreme so
you'll<00:04:37.350> see<00:04:37.590> for<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.070> supreme<00:04:38.370> effects<00:04:38.669> we've

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
you'll see for the supreme effects we've

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.550 
you'll see for the supreme effects we've
added<00:04:39.000> actually<00:04:39.330> four<00:04:39.750> different<00:04:39.780> components

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
added actually four different components

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.230 
added actually four different components
now<00:04:40.710> because<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> cover<00:04:41.340> right<00:04:41.580> here<00:04:41.610> you

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
now because of the cover right here you

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.750 
now because of the cover right here you
can<00:04:42.390> only<00:04:42.540> see<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> deep<00:04:43.050> op<00:04:43.260> really<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.919> so

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
can only see the deep op really and so

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.200 
can only see the deep op really and so
these<00:04:45.510> features<00:04:46.230> were<00:04:46.980> added<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.790> help

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
these features were added to help

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.390 
these features were added to help
improve<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.780> headphone<00:04:49.500> output<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:50.370> that

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
improve the headphone output so that

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.120
