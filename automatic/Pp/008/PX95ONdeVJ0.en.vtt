00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.510 
guess we'll do the Aspen buds because
their<00:05:06.020> budding<00:05:06.229> right<00:05:06.500> now<00:05:06.680> see<00:05:07.130> these<00:05:07.250> buds

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
their budding right now see these buds

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.510 
their budding right now see these buds
here<00:05:07.820> on<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.210> aspen<00:05:08.570> tree<00:05:09.100> well<00:05:10.100> those<00:05:10.280> can<00:05:10.460> be

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
here on the aspen tree well those can be

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.029 
here on the aspen tree well those can be
used<00:05:10.820> similar<00:05:11.449> to<00:05:11.840> aspirin<00:05:12.940> they<00:05:13.940> have<00:05:14.120> like

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
used similar to aspirin they have like

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.760 
used similar to aspirin they have like
Selleck<00:05:16.039> acid<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.550> them<00:05:16.870> which<00:05:17.870> reduces

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
Selleck acid in them which reduces

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.960 
Selleck acid in them which reduces
inflammation<00:05:20.050> so<00:05:21.050> if<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.440> ever<00:05:21.590> need<00:05:21.970> to
