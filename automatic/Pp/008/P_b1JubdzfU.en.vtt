brain that saturation up bring the
lightness<00:04:21.510> down<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:21.989> bit<00:04:22.849> so<00:04:23.849> right

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
lightness down a little bit so right

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.370 
lightness down a little bit so right
there<00:04:24.330> we're<00:04:24.780> gonna<00:04:24.900> leave<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.200> right<00:04:25.229> there

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
there we're gonna leave it right there

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.200 
there we're gonna leave it right there
that<00:04:25.770> way<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:25.979> know<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.580> got<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.849> black

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
that way you know it's got the black

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.050 
that way you know it's got the black
order<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.690> mean<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:29.610> gives<00:04:29.910> the

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
order I mean this is it gives the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
order I mean this is it gives the
impression<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.660> has<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.960> black<00:04:31.139> border

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
impression that it has the black border

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.129

and<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.860> red<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.580> know<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.819> red<00:04:33.000> inside<00:04:33.389> so

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
and the red you know the red inside so

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.260 
and the red you know the red inside so
uh<00:04:34.310> saturation<00:04:35.310> needs<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.520> be<00:04:35.639> at<00:04:35.699> about<00:04:35.819> fifty

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
uh saturation needs to be at about fifty

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.029 
uh saturation needs to be at about fifty
percent<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.930> lightness<00:04:37.500> needs<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.979> at

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
percent and the lightness needs to be at

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.659 
percent and the lightness needs to be at
about<00:04:38.250> forty<00:04:38.550> seven<00:04:38.880> percent<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:41.310> right<00:04:41.490> so

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669
