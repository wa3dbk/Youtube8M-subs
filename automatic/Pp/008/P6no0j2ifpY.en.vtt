00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 ricky 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 but he insisted that these laws 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.230
 hoping that someone wants to be better is a wine is a food the board of 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.499
 Andalusia

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.179
 there are many countries the bottom of the sea 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.179
 kevin costner and write fiction 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.350
 as in the Andalusian movie 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.740
 Well, there is the Andalusian coast 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.580
 it is quite diverse in many ways not only in biological sense but 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.760
 has a citizen section 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 great influence in latin america own statistics of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.240
 temperature 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.270
 and says that if people are produced after a museum 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.840
 you can see it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.290
 a lot of fish will be announced in the truth is that there 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.780
 very high number 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 Of fishes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.810
 it can be mere 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.239
 the furies 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.640
 the planned 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 the way since then those who go down the bottom 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.460
 I think it's a gift 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.329
 to little background 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.610
 We are talking 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 10 and 0 meters 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 even at that depth 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230
 from three tails 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.390
 the afp but you can see with the brunettes fiscal deficit 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.020
 the pcc 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.180
 for this incident 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.320
 in the hoisted country it seems protected species in different categories 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 the ferruginous lapa is a species 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.860
 dear extinction 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.580
 which has a distribution 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.010
 omoa patches we have specify 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.240
 in this category the theme 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.050
 vulnerable 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.350
 orange coral the 'ericsson 4' vargas 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.880
 finally marine 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.510
 which is also protected 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.620
 the chances are made by the csn species 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 the counseling what it does is a follow up of those species 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 and it can also be 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.950
 the zones 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.190
 percent especially a rich man naturally 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.820
 Juan because they have been well preserved 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.739
 protects them like this place 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.180
 from the psoe the natural setting of the cliffs of maro-cerro gordo and thus 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.609
 like this place and other places of the park 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.459
 in short there are different figures 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.039
 of protection for 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.580
 lt these areas of the territory the Basque statute 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.850
 the former technician with a job as a technician is 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.030
 precisely 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.839
 those species of the 'see you later' national 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.319
 the follow-up or exhibitions 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.039
 their populations are kept their populations are in regression 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.939
 house populations 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.169
 the pampa growing 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:46.469
 we take a series 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.729
 to all 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.740
 at the bottom of the sea a camosa bus that yes certain species 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.189
 from that catalog are also those who said that it is not 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.529
 chopped 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.459
 there is the great final several witnesses all this andalusia that we are technicians 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.039
 in all the coastal provinces 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.549
 p 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.589
 everything that exists can be done in statements to efe that this 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.399
 st 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.930
 piÃ±azo 0 is that we have to be there is that 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.989
 man for his part obama can do a lot the truth 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.989
 certainly you can do things for 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.810
 that seem insignificant as for example 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.389
 percent or marshal 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.749
 do not catch mussels or peace 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.439
 facing the goal and gave 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.409
 my image is all that is a state aid to collaborate 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:37.779
 do not throw 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:41.270
 to the sea the plastics or the minutes 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.720
 not picking up the bottom of the sea in any memory in a little bit the most 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.949
 there 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.019
 quito
