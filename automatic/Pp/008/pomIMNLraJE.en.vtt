00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
it's still in my car so it's not bad

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
it's still in my car so it's not bad
especially<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> price<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.149> paid<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.600> I

now with that being said it's not as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.500 
now with that being said it's not as
much<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.140> head<00:00:46.350> unit<00:00:47.510> there

much as I do like this head unit there

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.040 
much as I do like this head unit there
are<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.989> negatives<00:00:49.440> call<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> pet<00:00:50.700> peeve

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
are some negatives call it a pet peeve

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.529 
are some negatives call it a pet peeve

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
but I'm going to be a hundred percent

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.119 
but I'm going to be a hundred percent

let's start now these are just a minor
issues<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.290> could<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.650> been

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
issues I think that could have been

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
issues I think that could have been
could<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.970> been<00:01:06.090> handled<00:01:06.240> better<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:08.490> see

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
could have been handled better you see

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
could have been handled better you see
that<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.830> not

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
that right there it's not a you it's not

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.330 
that right there it's not a you it's not
a<00:01:11.010> standard<00:01:11.729> USB<00:01:12.060> port<00:01:12.320> that's<00:01:13.320> uh<00:01:13.590> that's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a standard USB port that's uh that's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.780 
a standard USB port that's uh that's
something<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> mini<00:01:15.240> USB<00:01:15.479> port<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
something that's a mini USB port so

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.039 
something that's a mini USB port so
that's<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.970> even<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> standard<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.750> phones

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that's not even a standard on phones

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.190 
that's not even a standard on phones
anymore<00:01:21.770> why<00:01:22.770> did<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.170> no

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
anymore why did they do that I have no

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.920 
anymore why did they do that I have no
idea<00:01:25.770> I'm<00:01:26.520> assuming<00:01:27.030> maybe<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.540> standard

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
idea I'm assuming maybe not to standard

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.520 
idea I'm assuming maybe not to standard
in<00:01:28.049> China<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:30.659> con<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> make

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
in China so it con would kind of make

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.649 
in China so it con would kind of make
sense<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.610> none<00:01:32.820> but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sense that they do it that way none but

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.649 
sense that they do it that way none but
I<00:01:33.689> wish<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.070> regular<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
I wish that was just a regular just a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.810 
I wish that was just a regular just a
regular<00:01:36.990> USB<00:01:37.170> port<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.070> don't<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> buy

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
regular USB port I don't have to buy

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
regular USB port I don't have to buy
adapters<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.570> anything<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
adapters or anything for it

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
adapters or anything for it
even<00:01:41.130> though<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.490> use<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.150> again<00:01:42.600> cuz

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
even though I don't use it so again cuz

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.880 
even though I don't use it so again cuz
it's<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.220> pet<00:01:44.399> peeve<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> mine<00:01:45.890> another

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890

thing<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.170> she's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thing I don't like about it is the she's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.810 
thing I don't like about it is the she's
noticed<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.180> magnifying<00:01:51.180> glass<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.810> I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
noticed little magnifying glass there I

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.990 
noticed little magnifying glass there I
thought<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.960> scan<00:01:56.000> through

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
thought that that was gonna scan through

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170 
thought that that was gonna scan through
the<00:01:57.420> whole<00:01:57.560> frequency<00:01:58.560> range<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.369> thing<00:02:00.030> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the whole frequency range the thing is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
the whole frequency range the thing is
it<00:02:00.329> doesn't<00:02:00.630> all<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.469> goes<00:02:01.799> through<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
it doesn't all it just goes through it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.760 
it doesn't all it just goes through it
just<00:02:02.399> scans<00:02:02.880> through<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.390> presets<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:04.619> i

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just scans through your presets which i

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
just scans through your presets which i
think<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.219> which<00:02:05.880> i<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
think is which i think is kind of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
think is which i think is kind of
pointless<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.890> there<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.310> option<00:02:08.489> or

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pointless if there was an option or

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
pointless if there was an option or
something<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.720> change<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.340> I

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
something I that I can change that to I

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.670 
something I that I can change that to I
think<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.150> would<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.959> would<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.110> better

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
think that would be that would be better

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119 
think that would be that would be better
giving<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> an<00:02:14.129> option<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.609> do<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
giving you an option to do that but it

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.179 
giving you an option to do that but it
doesn't<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.420> hit<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> EQ<00:02:19.200> button<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.920> not

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
doesn't if I hit the EQ button it's not

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.880 
doesn't if I hit the EQ button it's not
going<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.459> go<00:02:20.609> into<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.829> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
going to go into the it's not going to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.089 
going to go into the it's not going to
go<00:02:23.040> into<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:24.379> it's<00:02:25.379> not<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.829> go<00:02:25.920> through

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
go into the it's not going to go through

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.390 
go into the it's not going to go through
the<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.500> sound<00:02:28.769> options<00:02:29.250> or

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
looks decent here on the screen you're

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.849 
looks decent here on the screen you're
probably<00:03:32.489> seeing<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.939> looks<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.419> you<00:03:33.689> know

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
probably seeing it looks like you know

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.990 
probably seeing it looks like you know
you<00:03:34.859> know<00:03:34.949> you<00:03:35.040> probably<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.459> I'm<00:03:35.519> crazy<00:03:35.729> or

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you know you probably think I'm crazy or

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.170 
you know you probably think I'm crazy or
whatever<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.290> does<00:03:37.829> look<00:03:38.189> it<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.669> darker

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
whatever but it does look it is darker

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.490 
whatever but it does look it is darker
first<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.079> know<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.579> dark<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:41.939> here<00:03:42.150> then

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
first you know it is dark in here then

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.020 
first you know it is dark in here then
then<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.739> regular<00:03:44.159> radio<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:47.519> miracast

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
then on the regular radio the miracast

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.649 
then on the regular radio the miracast
works<00:03:48.389> as<00:03:48.599> function<00:03:49.049> as<00:03:49.229> its<00:03:49.979> supposed<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.659> the

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
works as function as its supposed to the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.420 
works as function as its supposed to the
only<00:03:51.840> thing<00:03:51.989> I'm<00:03:52.109> not<00:03:52.139> too<00:03:52.500> crazy<00:03:52.739> about<00:03:52.949> it<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
only thing I'm not too crazy about it I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.649 
only thing I'm not too crazy about it I
think<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.729> was<00:03:53.849> kind<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.120> overhyped<00:03:55.069> now<00:03:56.659> with

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
think it was kind of overhyped now with

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.780 
think it was kind of overhyped now with
miracast<00:03:58.229> I<00:03:58.590> can<00:03:58.829> pretty<00:03:59.280> much<00:03:59.370> whatever<00:03:59.609> is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.479 
it'll go off on the on the radio as well
too<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.290> just<00:04:20.620> have<00:04:20.769> a<00:04:20.799> blank<00:04:21.130> screen

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
too so you just have a blank screen

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.120 
too so you just have a blank screen
which<00:04:22.450> i<00:04:22.630> think<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:23.020> kind<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.650> kind<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:23.950> done

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
which i think is kind of is kind of done

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.010 
which i think is kind of is kind of done
it<00:04:24.280> would<00:04:24.370> have<00:04:24.490> been<00:04:24.669> uh<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.300> know<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.870> would

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
it would have been uh you know it would

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.930 
it would have been uh you know it would
have<00:04:26.110> been<00:04:26.200> nicer<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.830> could<00:04:27.040> actually<00:04:29.940> it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
have been nicer if you could actually it

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.430 
have been nicer if you could actually it
would<00:04:31.060> have<00:04:31.150> been<00:04:31.240> nicer<00:04:31.540> if<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.750> screen<00:04:32.080> on

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
would have been nicer if the screen on

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.409 
would have been nicer if the screen on
the<00:04:32.590> radio<00:04:32.919> stayed<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:34.120> know<00:04:34.240> maybe

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
the radio stayed on and you know maybe

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.540 
the radio stayed on and you know maybe
your<00:04:34.630> phone<00:04:34.840> turned<00:04:35.139> off<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.340> does

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
your phone turned off but it does

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.920 
your phone turned off but it does
exactly<00:04:36.910> what<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.360> know

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
exactly what you know

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.460 
exactly what you know
it<00:04:38.470> does<00:04:38.680> exactly<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:40.139> actually<00:04:41.139> just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
it does exactly that and actually just

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.280 
it does exactly that and actually just
like<00:04:41.620> with<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.130> with<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.669> DVD<00:04:43.180> again<00:04:43.660> because

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
like with the with the DVD again because

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.080 
like with the with the DVD again because
it's<00:04:44.440> like<00:04:44.530> odds<00:04:44.800> it's<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.400> video<00:04:45.669> that's<00:04:45.850> being

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
it's like odds it's a video that's being

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.360 
it's like odds it's a video that's being
used<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:48.100> screen<00:04:48.430> is<00:04:48.700> darker<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.130> it's<00:04:51.130> not

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
used the screen is darker so it's not

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.420 
used the screen is darker so it's not
that<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.910> know<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.889> don't<00:04:53.889> like<00:04:54.040> it<00:04:54.220> I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
that you know it's I don't like it I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.550 
that you know it's I don't like it I
really<00:04:55.240> don't<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.540> that<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.020> function

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
really don't like that that function

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.260 
really don't like that that function
that<00:04:56.650> much<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.100> really<00:04:57.130> don't<00:04:57.430> use<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.850> it's

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
that much and I really don't use it it's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.510 
that much and I really don't use it it's
a<00:04:58.419> shame<00:04:58.660> because<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.440> sound<00:05:00.010> quality<00:05:00.490> is

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
a shame because the sound quality is

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.900 
a shame because the sound quality is
much<00:05:00.970> better<00:05:01.210> than<00:05:02.130> than<00:05:03.130> using<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
much better than than using just a

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.090 
much better than than using just a
regular<00:05:04.240> Bluetooth<00:05:06.150> another<00:05:07.150> thing<00:05:07.950> might<00:05:08.950> be

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
regular Bluetooth another thing might be

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.550 
regular Bluetooth another thing might be
nitpicking<00:05:09.520> but<00:05:09.880> when<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:10.750> when<00:05:11.350> you're<00:05:11.530> on

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
nitpicking but when you when you're on

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.770 
nitpicking but when you when you're on
Bluetooth<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.669> want<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.000> listen<00:05:13.600> to

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
Bluetooth and you want to listen to

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.529 
Bluetooth and you want to listen to
music<00:05:13.930> or<00:05:14.320> sound<00:05:14.650> from<00:05:15.400> your<00:05:15.520> phone<00:05:15.789> I<00:05:16.000> thought

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
music or sound from your phone I thought

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.870 
music or sound from your phone I thought
this<00:05:16.750> is<00:05:16.900> all<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.229> displays<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:18.520> doesn't

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
this is all it displays it doesn't

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.779 
this is all it displays it doesn't
display<00:05:19.240> any<00:05:19.680> it<00:05:20.680> doesn't<00:05:20.950> have<00:05:21.070> any<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.760> know

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
display any it doesn't have any you know

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.390 
display any it doesn't have any you know
it<00:05:22.120> doesn't<00:05:22.330> display<00:05:22.600> any<00:05:23.100> what's<00:05:24.100> called<00:05:24.340> a

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
it doesn't display any what's called a

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.550 
it doesn't display any what's called a
meta<00:05:24.580> tagging<00:05:25.030> or<00:05:25.180> anything<00:05:25.979> so<00:05:26.979> that's<00:05:28.560> you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
meta tagging or anything so that's you

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.409 
meta tagging or anything so that's you
know<00:05:29.650> that's<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:30.010> that's<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.370> big<00:05:30.550> no-no<00:05:30.820> for<00:05:31.270> me

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
know that's a that's a big no-no for me

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.420 
know that's a that's a big no-no for me
but<00:05:32.410> uh<00:05:33.330> but<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.510> does<00:05:34.720> work<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.100> haven't

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
but uh but it does work and I haven't

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.510 
but uh but it does work and I haven't
had<00:05:36.520> a<00:05:36.550> problem<00:05:36.850> with<00:05:37.060> other<00:05:37.360> than<00:05:37.660> you<00:05:37.870> know

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
had a problem with other than you know

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.270 
had a problem with other than you know
again<00:05:39.520> I'm<00:05:39.640> probably<00:05:40.270> nitpicking<00:05:40.750> here<00:05:41.789> and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
again I'm probably nitpicking here and

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.409 
again I'm probably nitpicking here and
that's<00:05:45.280> about<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:46.300> can<00:05:46.570> think<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:47.080> now

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
that's about it I can think of now

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.909 
that's about it I can think of now
actually<00:05:49.419> no<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.870> probably<00:05:50.289> the<00:05:50.350> next<00:05:50.530> the

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
actually no the probably the next the

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.960 
actually no the probably the next the
biggest<00:05:51.370> thing<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:51.700> think<00:05:52.289> which<00:05:53.289> it<00:05:53.500> might<00:05:53.970> it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
biggest thing I think which it might it

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.090 
biggest thing I think which it might it
might<00:05:55.030> not<00:05:55.419> be<00:05:55.570> that<00:05:55.600> good<00:05:56.080> for<00:05:56.890> some<00:05:57.070> people

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
might not be that good for some people

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.760 
might not be that good for some people
because<00:05:58.289> this<00:05:59.289> radio<00:05:59.889> is<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.880> lot<00:06:01.600> bigger<00:06:02.080> well

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
because this radio is a lot bigger well

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.350 
because this radio is a lot bigger well
not<00:06:02.950> a<00:06:02.979> lot<00:06:03.220> but<00:06:03.430> like<00:06:03.580> a<00:06:03.610> few<00:06:03.850> millimeters

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
not a lot but like a few millimeters

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.510 
not a lot but like a few millimeters
bigger<00:06:04.600> than<00:06:05.380> other<00:06:05.530> than<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.740> double<00:06:06.100> din<00:06:06.280> you

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
bigger than other than a double din you

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.040 
bigger than other than a double din you
might<00:06:06.669> not<00:06:06.820> think<00:06:07.000> that's<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.300> big<00:06:07.510> deal<00:06:07.750> but

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
might not think that's a big deal but

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.950 
might not think that's a big deal but
when<00:06:08.260> you<00:06:08.710> have<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.889> tight<00:06:09.220> tolerance

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
when you have a tight tolerance

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.100 
when you have a tight tolerance
you<00:06:10.960> know<00:06:11.050> tight<00:06:11.289> tolerances<00:06:11.890> and<00:06:12.070> stuff<00:06:12.310> and

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
you know tight tolerances and stuff and

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.590 
you know tight tolerances and stuff and
needs<00:06:13.290> to<00:06:13.530> fit<00:06:13.770> properly<00:06:14.070> or<00:06:14.640> if<00:06:15.150> you're<00:06:15.330> using

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
needs to fit properly or if you're using

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.270 
needs to fit properly or if you're using
uh<00:06:15.870> if<00:06:16.260> you're<00:06:17.130> using<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:18.080> trim<00:06:19.080> plate<00:06:19.350> for<00:06:19.920> your

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
uh if you're using a trim plate for your

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.230 
uh if you're using a trim plate for your
for<00:06:20.820> your<00:06:20.850> radio<00:06:22.220> it's<00:06:23.220> not<00:06:23.520> going<00:06:23.880> to<00:06:24.030> fit

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
for your radio it's not going to fit

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.040 
for your radio it's not going to fit
around<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.870> radio<00:06:25.230> now<00:06:25.740> if<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:26.340> look<00:06:26.580> here

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
around the radio now if you look here

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.170 
around the radio now if you look here
you<00:06:28.050> notice<00:06:28.350> here<00:06:28.770> I<00:06:28.800> had<00:06:29.130> to<00:06:29.310> actually<00:06:29.730> cut<00:06:30.030> it

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
you notice here I had to actually cut it

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.580 
you notice here I had to actually cut it
so<00:06:30.810> it<00:06:31.020> doesn't<00:06:31.350> go<00:06:31.470> around<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.950> radio<00:06:32.280> at<00:06:32.430> all

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
so it doesn't go around the radio at all

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.510 
so it doesn't go around the radio at all
that's<00:06:34.590> probably<00:06:35.010> the<00:06:35.100> only<00:06:35.130> thing<00:06:35.280> I<00:06:35.460> don't

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
that's probably the only thing I don't

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.440 
that's probably the only thing I don't
like<00:06:35.850> about<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:37.050> it's<00:06:37.350> a<00:06:37.470> major<00:06:37.830> issue

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450
