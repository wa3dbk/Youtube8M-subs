00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I can from all agents we are in 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.290
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 let's see a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 mod a mod that is pretty good because 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 allows us to literally recycle 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 recycle and remove the objects that by 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.449
 or by b we no longer want them and the truth 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.390
 is that I see it very useful the question is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.580
 that from now on with this mode 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.620
 we can burn we are going to put coal here 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.990
 and we can burn things we are going to see 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.850
 that we burn iron for example a 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.670
 iron sword that we have made two 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.340
 or we have found one out there and already 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
 We do not want to burn it. This has 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.660
 seemed very cool days, especially very 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.070
 useful and by carrying the iron sword we 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.800
 They give 6 iron nights with 9 we do 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.110
 we make a bar of iron a bar and 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.770
 an iron ingot with 9 nuggets of 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.510
 these and apart the mountain of to create 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.330
 in the horse armor you will see that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.270
 hey it's not bad in fact here we have the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.030
 of emerald also 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.130
 as you see once and the diamond 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.800
 that also lets you thank you 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.310
 horse and horse armor apart from the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.240
 of gold as the Nazis already exist that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.430
 they come out more than art another good too 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.190
 allows us to create the one in the armor of 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.320
 golden horse which is quite 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.510
 cool, let's go, let's go try 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.210
 little things because it depends on the materials 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.620
 to use what they give you most or 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.350
 less for example the shovel that only uses 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.390
 a diamond we're going to burn it 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.610
 using only a diamond will give us 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.840
 less materials but this is cool dude 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.899
 I'm cool 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 so that it stays gives us three people 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.340
 diamond in streets we make an ax for 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.159
 example 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.259
 let's burn an ax since all three 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.890
 triple diamonds should give us the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.659
 triple that is nine nuggets 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.150
 or what is the same a diamond is 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.400
 very cool we are going to try a chest of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.280
 diamond should give us a lot with the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.750
 amount of diamonds that are spent on 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 more than one when we had enough 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 more forward of the game not when 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.090
 you just petar clear and it's cool 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.330
 24 at a time we're going to put a fifth and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 bolt 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 to show you what it is that I have 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.640
 said simply believe that way is already 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.980
 and third so good at 22 diamonds and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.330
 6 diamond ships of these are very 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.030
 pimps with leather things do not 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.709
 It works as proven to try but not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 it does not work let's talk about some boots 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.030
 gold for example so that we see that we 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.310
 they give gold ships and I'm looking here 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.720
 nine card for example can also be 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.970
 burn 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.310
 so let's try 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.530
 if it gives us 12 is the mini kart enough 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.569
 you can also burn and dwell a lot that 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 they are giving you because it is that in the end 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.069
 you always end up with more than one armor 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.590
 that does not help you give us 15 nobodies 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.910
 these iron is very very well is 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.890
 burning a field and I see that too 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.770
 it works what I do not know because of course 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.000
 dan 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.000
 once of emerald 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 then of emerald 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 If you do not have a block so you can go 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.470
 to burn a block 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.849
 you do not do it like that and they already have the 9 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.510
 then do not see it gives us 10 by the way 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.920
 the scope 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 never better said then I guess 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.620
 emerald will be for many others had 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 weapons and emerald armor which 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.560
 It can also be very good and go 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.110
 trying things we are going to try a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.270
 to me so you can also lighter not 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.340
 I think I can not not only now see if 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.260
 works 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.520
 more little things over here 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.210
 an iron door 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.680
 it also burns I'm really cool this god 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.840
 he has not done it because I see it very very very 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.220
 Useful 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.350
 here is something else 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.990
 not here not not 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.260
 I think you 're not before I tried 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.439
 one of these and it has not worked 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.290
 I suppose because it has more objects not 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.180
 the lighter does not work 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.159
 we can also burn the lighter 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.180
 although it will give us very little because only 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.079
 an ingot is used 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.079
 let's try 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.960
 if it's not bad not when you already have a 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.460
 normal bucket yes but that bucket with water 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.100
 for example the organ you already have is already 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.490
 mixed materials not but when you put 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.690
 some little things with ingots site I say 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.310
 some little things because portion of the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.770
 tools is also a three mix 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.830
 types of sticks and even then I do 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.490
 they do not know but it 's very very cool guy I 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.630
 this seems very good 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.979
 they wait for us here sees us a diamond mola 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.410
 a lot but good the description is for 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:56.349
 the 1.7 point 10 if it was agreeable 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:59.349
 cetera as always a lot 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.349
 bye
