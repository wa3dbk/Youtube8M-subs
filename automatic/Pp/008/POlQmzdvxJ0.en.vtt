black<00:04:04.750> wire<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.130> wire<00:04:06.190> leads<00:04:06.700> into<00:04:07.000> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
black wire and this wire leads into that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.920 
black wire and this wire leads into that
way<00:04:08.650> you<00:04:08.710> connect<00:04:09.160> into<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:09.520> old-age<00:04:09.910> box<00:04:10.270> now

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
way you connect into the old-age box now

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.400 
way you connect into the old-age box now
what<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:11.260> want<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.560> do<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:13.120> remove<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.720> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
what you want to do to remove this and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
what you want to do to remove this and
this<00:04:14.800> can<00:04:15.550> easily<00:04:15.970> slide<00:04:16.270> out<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:18.250> that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
this can easily slide out so like that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.080 
this can easily slide out so like that
it<00:04:18.790> just<00:04:18.850> pops<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.510> really<00:04:19.930> supporters<00:04:21.090> now

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
it just pops out really supporters now

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.580 
it just pops out really supporters now
you're<00:04:22.630> gonna<00:04:22.750> want<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.020> take<00:04:23.170> this<00:04:23.350> out<00:04:23.560> and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
you're gonna want to take this out and

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.910 
you're gonna want to take this out and
it's<00:04:24.070> really<00:04:24.190> simple

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.480 

there<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:33.040> is

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
there it is

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.560 
there it is
now<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.200> hard<00:04:35.410> drive<00:04:35.620> itself<00:04:36.570> and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
now this is the hard drive itself and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.700 
now this is the hard drive itself and
this<00:04:37.720> one<00:04:37.990> particularly<00:04:38.440> only<00:04:38.830> holds<00:04:39.220> 20<00:04:39.580> gig

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
this one particularly only holds 20 gig

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.650 
this one particularly only holds 20 gig
which<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:41.920> shame<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.730> got<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.060> limited

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
which is a shame because I got a limited

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.580 
which is a shame because I got a limited
edition<00:04:43.840> Xbox<00:04:44.380> my<00:04:44.770> expected<00:04:45.310> more<00:04:45.550> but<00:04:46.590> and

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
now I'll show you how this fits into the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.000 
now I'll show you how this fits into the
slim<00:04:51.660> right<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:54.040> is<00:04:55.140> this<00:04:56.140> is<00:04:56.350> much<00:04:56.590> better

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
slim right this is this is much better

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.330 
slim right this is this is much better
Xbox<00:04:57.460> console<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.240> use<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.810> for<00:04:59.020> hot<00:04:59.740> swapping

push it in and it's quite small you in
have<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.340> be<00:05:45.430> careful<00:05:45.820> and

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:54.020 

they<00:05:50.189> yeah<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:51.090> just<00:05:51.300> sits<00:05:51.509> in<00:05:51.689> like<00:05:52.500> that<00:05:53.030> so

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030

they yeah it just sits in like that so
now<00:05:55.159> this<00:05:56.159> will<00:05:56.430> be<00:05:57.080> compatible<00:05:58.080> with<00:05:58.530> the

00:05:59.179 --> 00:05:59.189 
now this will be compatible with the

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.839 
now this will be compatible with the
slim<00:05:59.909> so<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:00.930> you<00:06:01.110> can't<00:06:01.439> if<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.340> have<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.550> four

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
slim so if you can't if you have a four

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.100 
slim so if you can't if you have a four
gig<00:06:03.000> BIOS<00:06:03.449> box<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:04.770> will<00:06:04.919> have<00:06:05.129> a<00:06:05.990> hard<00:06:06.990> drive

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
gig BIOS box it will have a hard drive

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.619 
gig BIOS box it will have a hard drive
slot<00:06:07.560> available<00:06:08.189> but<00:06:08.879> you<00:06:08.909> won't<00:06:09.180> get<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.360> hard

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
slot available but you won't get a hard

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.390 
slot available but you won't get a hard
drive<00:06:09.840> it<00:06:10.379> will<00:06:10.439> have<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.680> built<00:06:11.009> in<00:06:11.159> memory

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
drive it will have a built in memory

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.209 
drive it will have a built in memory
system<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.960> if<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:13.229> have<00:06:13.409> or<00:06:13.590> not<00:06:13.680> if<00:06:14.009> you've

had an old Xbox then you can use the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.899 
had an old Xbox then you can use the
hard<00:06:18.629> drive<00:06:18.870> from<00:06:19.110> that<00:06:19.199> and<00:06:19.710> you<00:06:20.280> can<00:06:20.430> open<00:06:20.819> up

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
hard drive from that and you can open up

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.719 
hard drive from that and you can open up
following<00:06:21.599> this<00:06:21.840> tutorial<00:06:22.310> and<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.400> can<00:06:23.550> use

following this tutorial and you can use

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.240 
following this tutorial and you can use
it<00:06:23.879> for<00:06:23.969> the<00:06:24.090> skin<00:06:24.330> so<00:06:25.139> it<00:06:25.199> just<00:06:25.409> fits<00:06:25.529> in<00:06:25.800> like

that<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:27.090> I'm<00:06:27.210> sure<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.539> will<00:06:27.599> work<00:06:27.659> with<00:06:28.050> the

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
that and I'm sure it will work with the

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.969 
that and I'm sure it will work with the
