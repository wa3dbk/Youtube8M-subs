removing<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.400> tire<00:00:39.030> valve<00:00:39.449> cap<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.440> use

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
removing the tire valve cap you can use

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
removing the tire valve cap you can use
a<00:00:40.650> digital<00:00:40.980> tire<00:00:41.430> pressure<00:00:41.790> gauge<00:00:41.910> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a digital tire pressure gauge we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
a digital tire pressure gauge we
recommend<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.949> type<00:00:44.220> of<00:00:44.250> gauge<00:00:44.580> because<00:00:45.150> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
recommend this type of gauge because it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.719 
recommend this type of gauge because it
gives<00:00:45.479> you<00:00:45.690> an<00:00:45.780> accurate<00:00:46.019> reading<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:47.460> place

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
gives you an accurate reading you place

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:54.340 
gives you an accurate reading you place
it<00:00:47.970> on<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.210> tire<00:00:48.629> valves<00:00:49.699> hold<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.370> remove

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
it on the tire valves hold and remove

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.170 
it on the tire valves hold and remove
tire<00:00:55.350> pressure<00:00:55.769> for<00:00:56.400> this<00:00:56.989> rear<00:00:57.989> tire<00:00:58.409> is<00:00:59.180> 36.5

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
tire pressure for this rear tire is 36.5

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
tire pressure for this rear tire is 36.5
psi<00:01:00.839> is<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.860> pound<00:01:02.339> over<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.260> manufacturer

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
psi is one pound over the manufacturer

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
psi is one pound over the manufacturer
specifications<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:07.010> what<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.190> do<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.659> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
specifications so what you do is the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.620 
specifications so what you do is the
actual<00:01:10.049> tire<00:01:10.470> valve<00:01:10.830> cap<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> point<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
actual tire valve cap has a point on it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
actual tire valve cap has a point on it
so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.590> release<00:01:13.920> air<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.880> tire

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so you can release air from the tire

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.160 
so you can release air from the tire
place<00:01:15.980> it<00:01:16.980> on<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.430> interval

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.719 

we<00:01:24.170> check<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:26.590> make<00:01:27.590> sure<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.220> tire<00:01:28.460> is

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
we check to make sure that the tire is

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.000 
we check to make sure that the tire is
not<00:01:28.940> under<00:01:29.390> inflated<00:01:34.300> we<00:01:35.300> have<00:01:35.450> now<00:01:35.890> adjust<00:01:36.890> to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
not under inflated we have now adjust to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.690 
not under inflated we have now adjust to
the<00:01:37.130> tire<00:01:37.369> pressure<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.479> proper<00:01:38.869> PSI<00:01:39.700> be

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the tire pressure to the proper PSI be

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.090 
the tire pressure to the proper PSI be
sure<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.330> reinstall<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.200> cap<00:01:42.440> that<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:42.920> did

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
sure to reinstall the cap that you did

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:58.430 
sure to reinstall the cap that you did
remove<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.960> you're<00:01:47.960> done
