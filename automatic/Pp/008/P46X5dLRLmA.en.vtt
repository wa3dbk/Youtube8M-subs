00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello we have destroyed here week 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.140
 collector's edition and we are happy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.670
 to unpack it 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 It's called an unboxing video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.889
 left but it is not special 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:21.539
 That's why we're creative with that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.220
 or without a fair we might want 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 talk about what's already in there is no 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.039
 you know you can do it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.359
 they are the same things in any case 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 in it as in the title of collector's 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.660
 edition 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.140
 that means for one ipad install that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.200
 was still in it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.399
 a mousepad in the tecchannel resort 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 to go out for the titles 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.940
 I thought it was the thing that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 We're just starting to make the hair are in the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 Sande example a top team from the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.059
 yes all the avatars the war wounds 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.170
 Flag for the gaps for liable 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.800
 Of course, everything is back here 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:07.070
 On top of that you can see pretty well 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:09.210
 the whole thing out again 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.040
 no this is not a box that is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 namely directly the art book that is the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 on tanja probably steep again 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.439
 the thing goes shows the camera 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 but it's also special on making 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 is it correct that I too that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.990
 addressed mouse pad is not that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
 Total does not have to print anymore 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.680
 So really dumb, this mouse is included 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.900
 only bad about all not much more 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:40.650
 there are pictures in it of press 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.299
 worldsoft much much much artwork 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 shows you how to stop it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.829
 you should there because it changes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 not great either then what the individual 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.960
 Zones at the back then probably 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.049
 I also take a lot of new 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 Place and weapon yes so the same 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 position in the reason as usual however 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 Well , I'm open 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.219
 I'm not so internet but people are 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.970
 like impression are from this and 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.710
 love 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.850
 The surface is pretty cool that is 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.500
 not only very cheap here 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.320
 imprinted that is actually here 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.080
 grooved with with passport contributed to 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:20.880
 touch a bit slippery here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.740
 Can you name tomorrow what we have 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 we have here as always the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.700
 soundtrack the custom I think 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.980
 Do not open because if the cover is gone 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can not hear it but if you are 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.790
 could it be green to the soundtrack yet 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470
 are you there no because I do not know 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.750
 Again, the game is, of course 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.760
 a blind imposing why 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.780
 look at 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.310
 of course with the codes in here 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.620
 you can play the game of course 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
 also digital download one would be so times 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 to all the dvds can be free 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 pressed and now the color 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.570
 is sad only and on dvd saw mine 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.860
 soul and feeling and here as always 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.200
 in every collector's edition 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.510
 usually standard content one one 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.320
 dvd or and will already be the tvb of it 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.330
 Blu ray dvd is why the dvd video 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.320
 eighth is synonymous blu-ray ok 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.940
 probably you can go ahead 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.090
 leaked what it is in all cases 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.550
 is the behind the scenes material on it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.730
 probably a lot 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.519
 well package chris metzen and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.200
 consort via molotov trainer adrion 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.880
 story in the normal case very much 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.230
 said and what have they here and 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 thought it is worth it 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.450
 most of the time to look at whoever something 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.310
 Of course, that is all that is 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.810
 In principle I think that is one of the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.660
 few collector's editions whether one the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.860
 content now or not 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.390
 the things are just fine 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.620
 in the closet and fall now the sixth 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.670
 box who really everything together 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.160
 has that been solid from otherwise clear 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.799
 if it's just about pet and mount and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.540
 the avatars if any of the net with 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.769
 the digital editions probably one 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.049
 a little better there is as I said 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.299
 the ingame things just like this one has 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.100
 things to touch so the touch 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.380
 Well, who should buy the yes 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.760
 Looks great on all cases 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.690
 I would pick myself but unfortunately I have 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.120
 already the start 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.670
 i have no money i have a child 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.170
 I spared only space on dishes 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.180
 is five years ago my joy is it 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.489
 no longer designed it says itself 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.420
 may or may be to blame 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.910
 I buy the secret collector's 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.859
 edition for work and do it now 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.790
 We continue with the right unboxing 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.790
 look better now
