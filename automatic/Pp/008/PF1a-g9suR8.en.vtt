and then our blind spot and we literally

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.120 
and then our blind spot and we literally
try<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.720> get<00:01:52.870> there<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.170> go<00:01:53.260> red<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.920> now<00:01:54.070> we

try to get there to go red and now we

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.890 
try to get there to go red and now we

good in our last scenario I think is the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.559 
good in our last scenario I think is the

most one of the most compelling
scenarios<00:02:53.609> this<00:02:54.609> is<00:02:54.790> an<00:02:54.909> intersection

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
scenarios this is an intersection

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.440 
scenarios this is an intersection
scenario<00:02:56.439> so<00:02:57.219> imagine<00:02:57.700> if<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.909> will<00:02:58.030> you're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
to go through the intersection however

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.500 
to go through the intersection however
you<00:03:05.439> can't<00:03:05.769> see<00:03:06.129> what's<00:03:07.030> coming<00:03:07.299> in<00:03:07.480> the

you can't see what's coming in the
