two bottom colors right here took me

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760 
two bottom colors right here took me
about<00:01:51.000> six<00:01:51.689> months<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.439> grow<00:01:52.619> my

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
about six months or so to grow my

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.850 
about six months or so to grow my
eyebrows<00:01:53.130> out<00:01:53.310> fully<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.320> could<00:01:55.470> get

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
eyebrows out fully so that I could get

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740 
eyebrows out fully so that I could get
this<00:01:56.009> arch<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.119> before<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.689> were

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
this arch them because before they were

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
just kind of more like a you know like
just<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> curve<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
just like a curve but I really really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.410 
just like a curve but I really really
wanted<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> arch<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.119> thought<00:02:03.270> it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
minute they are already kind of their

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.000 
minute they are already kind of their
plots<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.780> an<00:02:17.930> arch<00:02:18.139> already<00:02:18.499> a<00:02:18.560> little<00:02:18.769> bit

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
plots to an arch already a little bit

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.129 
plots to an arch already a little bit
but<00:02:19.519> as<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.030> guys<00:02:20.150> will<00:02:20.359> also<00:02:20.689> tell<00:02:20.930> they're

but as you guys will also tell they're

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.199 
but as you guys will also tell they're
not<00:02:21.319> really<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> full<00:02:22.129> it's<00:02:22.489> not<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:22.939> you<00:02:23.090> know

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
not really a full it's not like you know

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.929 
not really a full it's not like you know
all<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.540> hair<00:02:23.749> there<00:02:24.049> is<00:02:24.290> completely<00:02:25.189> grown

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
all the hair there is completely grown

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.259 
all the hair there is completely grown
in<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.870> basically<00:02:27.439> you<00:02:27.769> know<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.280> use<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
in so basically you know I use the

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.440 
in so basically you know I use the
powder<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.900> make<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.680> arch<00:02:30.889> more<00:02:31.450> predominant

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
powder to make the arch more predominant

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.869 
powder to make the arch more predominant
and<00:02:32.739> really<00:02:33.739> stand<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.310> would<00:02:34.459> really<00:02:34.639> make

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
and really stand that would really make

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.690 
and really stand that would really make
it<00:02:34.939> a<00:02:35.269> very<00:02:35.599> nice<00:02:36.349> arch<00:02:36.680> would<00:02:37.219> suggest<00:02:37.459> that
