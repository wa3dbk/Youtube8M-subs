think actually the last time I talked

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.179 
think actually the last time I talked
about<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> bracket<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:10.950> might<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189

strike<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.979> guess<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> could<00:01:23.460> say<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> chem<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
strike I guess you could say a chem in a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.980 
strike I guess you could say a chem in a
box<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.939> vector<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.630> lot<00:01:27.930> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
box with the vector I do get a lot of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
box with the vector I do get a lot of
gun<00:01:28.259> kills<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.490> nice

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
gun kills and I do go on a pretty nice

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
gun kills and I do go on a pretty nice
streak<00:01:30.290> here<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.409> middle<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.650> 16<00:01:32.310> 17

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
streak here in the middle like 16 17

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
streak here in the middle like 16 17
kills<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.710> think

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
kills something like that so I I think

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
kills something like that so I I think
it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> pretty<00:01:35.670> exciting<00:01:36.090> game<00:01:36.119> i'm<00:01:36.329> using

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's a pretty exciting game i'm using

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.429 
it's a pretty exciting game i'm using
the<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.470> excal<00:01:38.009> strategy<00:01:38.700> i<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the the excal strategy i don't know if a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.719 
the the excal strategy i don't know if a
lot<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.590> people<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.549> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
lot of people know about this but in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.450 
lot of people know about this but in
modern<00:01:41.970> warfare<00:01:42.090> 3<00:01:42.829> Xcal<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:44.040> least<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
modern warfare 3 Xcal at least was the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.539 
modern warfare 3 Xcal at least was the
first<00:01:44.670> person<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.090> saw<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.009> um<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.460> know

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
first person that I saw that um you know

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
first person that I saw that um you know
put<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.060> less<00:01:48.479> streaks<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
put on less streaks you know like you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
put on less streaks you know like you
could<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.159> three<00:01:50.640> streaks<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.079> put

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
could have three streaks but if you put

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.950 
could have three streaks but if you put
one<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.710> two<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.880> instead<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> don't

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
one or two on then instead of you don't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
one or two on then instead of you don't
having<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.500> let's<00:01:56.460> say<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
having to get let's say you have like a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
having to get let's say you have like a
three<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> five<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> seven<00:01:58.140> kill<00:01:58.290> streak<00:01:58.500> on

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
three of five and a seven kill streak on

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.810 
three of five and a seven kill streak on
you<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.610> way<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you don't have to get all the way up to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.389 
you don't have to get all the way up to
seven<00:02:00.149> kills<00:02:00.329> say<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:01.140> UAVs<00:02:02.070> like

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
seven kills say you just want UAVs like

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.929 
seven kills say you just want UAVs like
I'm<00:02:02.520> doing<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:02.969> game<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:04.380> uh<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
I'm doing in this game I just uh you

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.249 
I'm doing in this game I just uh you
know<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:07.049> one

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
know because you can get more than one

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.600 
know because you can get more than one
of<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> same<00:02:07.649> kill<00:02:07.860> streak<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.250> life<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
of the same kill streak in my life I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
of the same kill streak in my life I
just<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> UAVs<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.110> every<00:02:10.259> three

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just have UAVs on so it's every three

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
just have UAVs on so it's every three
kills<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> UAV<00:02:11.640> instead<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> know

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
kills I get a UAV instead of you know

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
kills I get a UAV instead of you know
having<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.769> my<00:02:13.799> other<00:02:14.040> shrieks<00:02:14.310> too

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
having to get all my other shrieks too

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.039 
having to get all my other shrieks too
so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.939> know<00:02:15.269> it's<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.780> fun<00:02:15.900> little

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
so I know it's kind of a fun little

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.929 
so I know it's kind of a fun little
strategy<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.159> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.430> want<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.700> try<00:02:17.879> it

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
strategy if you want to want to try it

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.819 
strategy if you want to want to try it
out<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:18.989> better<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.409> modern

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
out it was a lot better on modern

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.140 
out it was a lot better on modern
warfare<00:02:19.950> 3<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.310> think<00:02:20.579> because<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.849> could<00:02:21.000> use

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
warfare 3 I think because you could use

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.229 
warfare 3 I think because you could use
the<00:02:21.870> UAV<00:02:22.319> ballistic<00:02:22.890> best<00:02:23.099> combo<00:02:23.610> but

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
the UAV ballistic best combo but

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.289 
the UAV ballistic best combo but
ballistic<00:02:24.810> vessel<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.519> six<00:02:26.519> or<00:02:26.760> eight<00:02:27.030> I

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
ballistic vessel like six or eight I

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.819 
ballistic vessel like six or eight I
think<00:02:27.599> they're<00:02:27.720> eight<00:02:27.870> kills<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.650> game

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
think they're eight kills in this game

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.619 
think they're eight kills in this game
so<00:02:28.980> they're<00:02:29.099> definitely<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:30.150> nearly<00:02:30.420> as

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
so they're definitely not that nearly as

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.349 
so they're definitely not that nearly as
good<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:30.989> they<00:02:31.530> were<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.769> last<00:02:31.920> game<00:02:32.359> but

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
good as they were in the last game but

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.330 
good as they were in the last game but
uh<00:02:33.420> yeah<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:34.829> there's<00:02:35.069> something

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
uh yeah I don't know there's something

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.720 
uh yeah I don't know there's something
about<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.790> vector<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:37.049> know<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:38.459> has

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
about this vector I don't know if it has

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.460 
about this vector I don't know if it has
a<00:02:38.760> faster<00:02:39.359> 80s<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.989> because<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.260> mean<00:02:40.409> I'm

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
a faster 80s time because I mean I'm

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.160 
a faster 80s time because I mean I'm
using<00:02:40.650> quick<00:02:41.519> draw<00:02:41.730> stocker<00:02:42.269> sleight<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> hand

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
using quick draw stocker sleight of hand

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500 
using quick draw stocker sleight of hand
righty<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.010> focus<00:02:44.489> i<00:02:44.819> believe<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.239> what's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
righty up and focus i believe is what's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.569 
righty up and focus i believe is what's
on<00:02:45.659> my<00:02:45.750> class<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.769> feels<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.129> for<00:02:47.430> some

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
on my class but it feels like for some

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.399 
on my class but it feels like for some
reason<00:02:47.609> when<00:02:48.000> i'm<00:02:48.090> using<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.450> vector<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
reason when i'm using the vector this

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.520 
reason when i'm using the vector this
thing<00:02:49.680> 80s<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.909> super<00:02:51.810> fast<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.349> feels

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
thing 80s is like super fast it feels

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.170 
thing 80s is like super fast it feels
like<00:02:52.650> an<00:02:52.799> 80s<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.250> faster<00:02:53.639> than<00:02:53.790> any<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
like an 80s is faster than any of the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.619 
like an 80s is faster than any of the
other<00:02:54.269> guns<00:02:54.510> I'm<00:02:54.829> pretty<00:02:55.829> sure<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.190> does<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.730> I

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
other guns I'm pretty sure it does and I

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.629 
other guns I'm pretty sure it does and I
know<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:58.200> seems<00:02:58.379> to<00:02:58.560> work<00:02:58.739> really<00:02:59.010> well

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
know it just seems to work really well

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.629 
know it just seems to work really well
slap<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> red<00:03:00.480> dot<00:03:00.689> on<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.049> thing<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.639> that's

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
slap a red dot on that thing and that's

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.979 
slap a red dot on that thing and that's
of<00:03:02.760> course<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.030> kid<00:03:03.239> who<00:03:03.329> kills<00:03:03.510> me<00:03:03.599> this<00:03:03.810> dude

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
of course the kid who kills me this dude

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.869 
of course the kid who kills me this dude
in<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.680> ghillie<00:03:04.980> suit<00:03:05.220> man<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> played<00:03:05.790> with

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
in the ghillie suit man I played with

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.539 
in the ghillie suit man I played with
him<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.239> few<00:03:06.389> games<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:07.079> how<00:03:07.889> do<00:03:07.950> i<00:03:08.099> get<00:03:08.430> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
him for a few games and how do i get the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.119 
him for a few games and how do i get the
ghillie<00:03:08.730> suit<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.209> i'm<00:03:09.329> guessing<00:03:09.569> it

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
ghillie suit but i'm guessing it

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.039 
ghillie suit but i'm guessing it
requires<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.250> lot<00:03:11.639> of<00:03:11.670> douchebaggery<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.019> I

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
requires a lot of douchebaggery so I

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.410 
requires a lot of douchebaggery so I
that<00:03:13.620> guy<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.859> know<00:03:14.099> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.489> pretty<00:03:15.120> much<00:03:15.180> is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that guy you know kind of pretty much is

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.849 
that guy you know kind of pretty much is
laying<00:03:15.599> prone<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.170> ground<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> whole

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
laying prone on the ground for the whole

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.250 
laying prone on the ground for the whole
game<00:03:17.389> I'm<00:03:18.389> guessing<00:03:18.660> that's<00:03:18.750> kind<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.139> how<00:03:19.230> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
game I'm guessing that's kind of how you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.390 
game I'm guessing that's kind of how you
get<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> maybe<00:03:19.859> it's<00:03:20.010> something<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.310> with

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
get it maybe it's something to do with

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.939 
get it maybe it's something to do with
prone<00:03:20.639> kills<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.569> ya<00:03:22.470> know<00:03:22.680> there's

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
prone kills but ya know there's

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.680 
prone kills but ya know there's
something<00:03:23.160> about<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.400> vector<00:03:23.699> it<00:03:23.910> feels

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
something about the vector it feels

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.449 
something about the vector it feels
really<00:03:25.049> really<00:03:25.440> good<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.980> first<00:03:26.099> time<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.370> used

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
really really good the first time I used
