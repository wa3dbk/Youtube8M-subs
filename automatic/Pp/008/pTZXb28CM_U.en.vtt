complex<00:00:57.090> songs<00:00:57.480> shined<00:00:58.260> through<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.309> just

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
complex songs shined through it was just

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.360

is<00:03:55.969> so<00:03:56.359> fantastic<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.859> justifies<00:03:58.250> the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
is so fantastic that it justifies the

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.189 
is so fantastic that it justifies the
seven-minute<00:03:59.269> length<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.719> this<00:03:59.810> song<00:04:00.019> it

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
seven-minute length of this song it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.959 
seven-minute length of this song it
really<00:04:00.349> could<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:00.769> used<00:04:00.799> maybe<00:04:01.639> a<00:04:01.730> bit<00:04:01.939> more

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
really could have used maybe a bit more

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.149 
really could have used maybe a bit more
forethought<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.959> few<00:04:03.169> more<00:04:03.349> changes<00:04:04.010> and

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
forethought and a few more changes and

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.189 
forethought and a few more changes and
some<00:04:04.549> songs<00:04:04.819> on<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.180> LP<00:04:05.359> feel<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:05.900> they<00:04:05.989> had

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
some songs on this LP feel like they had

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.780 
some songs on this LP feel like they had
a<00:04:06.230> bit<00:04:06.439> more<00:04:06.620> planning<00:04:07.069> involved<00:04:07.519> like<00:04:07.639> the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
a bit more planning involved like the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.240 
a bit more planning involved like the
track<00:04:08.000> your<00:04:08.180> father's<00:04:08.569> eyes<00:04:08.780> which<00:04:09.500> has<00:04:09.980> some

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
track your father's eyes which has some

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.129 
track your father's eyes which has some
really<00:04:10.370> awesome<00:04:10.579> horn<00:04:11.060> work<00:04:11.269> in<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.870> track

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
really awesome horn work in the track

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.770 
really awesome horn work in the track
and<00:04:12.169> has<00:04:12.709> a<00:04:12.739> bit<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.099> a<00:04:13.129> waltz<00:04:13.849> to<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:14.480> groove

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
and has a bit of a waltz to the groove

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.719 
and has a bit of a waltz to the groove
sort<00:04:15.409> of<00:04:15.500> sounds<00:04:15.829> like<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:16.039> soundtrack<00:04:16.370> to

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
sort of sounds like the soundtrack to

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.060 
sort of sounds like the soundtrack to
the<00:04:16.849> most<00:04:17.090> depressing<00:04:17.479> prom<00:04:17.900> ever<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:18.859> the

the most depressing prom ever in the
history<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:20.120> world<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.989> song<00:04:21.169> moves

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
history of the world and the song moves

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.290 
history of the world and the song moves
through<00:04:21.739> several<00:04:22.070> different<00:04:22.699> instrumental

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
through several different instrumental

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.719 
through several different instrumental
shifts<00:04:23.690> without<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.990> hitch<00:04:24.289> it's<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:25.130> good<00:04:25.460> track

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
shifts without a hitch it's a good track

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.760 
shifts without a hitch it's a good track
and<00:04:25.940> pushes<00:04:26.210> beyond<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:27.139> seven-minute

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
and pushes beyond that seven-minute

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.080 
and pushes beyond that seven-minute
length<00:04:27.979> I<00:04:28.220> think<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:28.729> are<00:04:28.820> some<00:04:28.909> high

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
length I think there are some high

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.629 
length I think there are some high
points<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.720> LP<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.259> I<00:04:30.320> can't<00:04:30.680> shake<00:04:31.460> the

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
points on this LP but I can't shake the

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.999 
points on this LP but I can't shake the
feeling<00:04:31.880> that<00:04:32.150> maybe<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.139> album<00:04:33.620> is<00:04:33.770> really

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
feeling that maybe this album is really

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.680 
feeling that maybe this album is really
only<00:04:34.400> going<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.669> be<00:04:34.729> entertaining<00:04:35.300> for<00:04:35.419> ice

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
think the main mission of this LP is

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.629 
think the main mission of this LP is
emotional<00:04:53.330> intensity<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.199> just<00:04:54.740> tension

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
emotional intensity and just tension

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.460 
emotional intensity and just tension
building<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.389> instrumentals<00:04:56.990> which
