00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
Express SSD I'm going to be putting this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.500 
Express SSD I'm going to be putting this
in<00:00:26.189> my<00:00:26.220> mouth<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.760> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
in my mouth and my

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.160 
in my mouth and my
dell<00:00:27.930> mini<00:00:27.960> 9<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.449> l<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:30.929> 99<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> first

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
dell mini 9 so l is from 99 but so first

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
dell mini 9 so l is from 99 but so first
of<00:00:34.350> all<00:00:34.440> when<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> come<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> comes<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of all when I come as it comes in this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.490 
of all when I come as it comes in this
odd<00:00:36.989> packaging<00:00:37.710> by<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> lies<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.969> know

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
odd packaging by the lies so you know

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.549 
odd packaging by the lies so you know
and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:41.360> from<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.320> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and then from there there's some really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.130 
and then from there there's some really
nice<00:00:43.800> foam<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.579> comes<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
nice foam that it comes in so it's a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
nice foam that it comes in so it's a
little<00:00:46.320> bit<00:00:46.559> wavy<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.579> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
little bit wavy I think that's for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
little bit wavy I think that's for
cushion<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:48.780> whatever<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> warranty

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cushion or whatever you get a warranty

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
cushion or whatever you get a warranty
card<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.280> speak<00:00:53.879> perfect<00:00:54.390> English

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
card you do I speak perfect English

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.540 
card you do I speak perfect English
should<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.629> then<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.859> SSD

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
should do it and then here is the SSD

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.609 
should do it and then here is the SSD
itself<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.600> anything<00:01:00.840> under<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> phone

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
itself is there anything under the phone

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
itself is there anything under the phone
okay<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.860> video<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.689> apparently<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> can

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
okay my video and apparently you can

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
okay my video and apparently you can
take<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> part<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> film<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
take this part of the film off and I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
take this part of the film off and I
guess<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> cool<00:01:10.260> feature<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> box

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
guess that's a cool feature of the box

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
guess that's a cool feature of the box
okay<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> SSD<00:01:15.810> comes

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
okay and then so when the SSD comes

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
okay and then so when the SSD comes
you'll<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:19.020> 32<00:01:19.729> gigabyte

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you'll see this side the 32 gigabyte

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.950 
you'll see this side the 32 gigabyte
symbol<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.310> then<00:01:23.310> it'll<00:01:23.490> say<00:01:23.610> SSD<00:01:24.540> on

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
symbol on it and then it'll say SSD on

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
symbol on it and then it'll say SSD on
it<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.439> over<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.280> make<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.670> look<00:01:26.970> really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it all over it and make it look really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.140 
it all over it and make it look really
awesome<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.610> take<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
awesome so from there you just take it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.679 
awesome so from there you just take it
out<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.079> anti-static<00:01:37.799> bag<00:01:38.159> being

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
out of the anti-static bag being

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
out of the anti-static bag being
extremely<00:01:39.689> careful<00:01:40.130> don't<00:01:41.130> lose<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.579> thing

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
extremely careful don't lose this thing

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.440 
extremely careful don't lose this thing
you<00:01:42.119> spent<00:01:42.420> forty<00:01:42.689> five<00:01:42.899> bucks<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> thing

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you spent forty five bucks on this thing

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.399 
you spent forty five bucks on this thing
and<00:01:47.210> yeah<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.200> into

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and yeah now I'm going to go into

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.499 
and yeah now I'm going to go into
installation<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:51.210> um<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:52.590> device

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.319 

okay<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.350> how<00:01:59.649> you<00:01:59.710> can<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:04.119> is

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
okay so this is how you can this is

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.679 
okay so this is how you can this is
basically<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.229> install<00:02:05.859> of<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.069> SSD<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:07.509> case

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
basically the install of the SSD in case

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.410 
basically the install of the SSD in case
you<00:02:07.899> didn't<00:02:08.170> know<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> PCIe<00:02:09.310> SSD<00:02:09.670> so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
you didn't know this is a PCIe SSD so

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.390 
you didn't know this is a PCIe SSD so
you<00:02:11.050> basically<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.890> check<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.280> make

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you basically have to check and make

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.300 
you basically have to check and make
sure<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.610> laptop<00:02:13.209> has<00:02:13.420> two<00:02:13.989> wireless<00:02:14.799> card

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
sure your laptop has two wireless card

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.009 
sure your laptop has two wireless card
slots<00:02:15.640> because<00:02:15.970> they<00:02:16.180> use<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> same<00:02:16.720> thing

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
slots because they use the same thing

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.350 
slots because they use the same thing
from<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.830> look<00:02:21.099> inside<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:22.180> your

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
from there just look inside of your

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.250 
from there just look inside of your
actual<00:02:24.000> laptop<00:02:25.000> or<00:02:25.510> look<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.019> teardown

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
actual laptop or look up the teardown

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.430 
actual laptop or look up the teardown
see<00:02:26.769> which<00:02:27.040> lock<00:02:27.519> cover<00:02:27.819> has<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.989> hard<00:02:29.200> drive

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
see which lock cover has the hard drive

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.360 
see which lock cover has the hard drive
bay<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:30.329> for<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.019> all<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:33.069> it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
bay in it for this one it's all of it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.500 
bay in it for this one it's all of it
this<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.849> a<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.150> mini<00:02:34.390> nine<00:02:36.150> take<00:02:37.150> off<00:02:37.390> this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this is a down mini nine take off this

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.789 
this is a down mini nine take off this
slot<00:02:37.780> cover<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.769> shows<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.280> insides<00:02:42.660> and

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
slot cover and it shows the insides and

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.589 
slot cover and it shows the insides and
here's<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.980> SSD<00:02:45.519> this<00:02:45.790> here's<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> wireless

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
here's the SSD this here's the wireless

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.150 
here's the SSD this here's the wireless
card<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.019> need<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.379> tell<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> difference

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
card you need to tell the difference

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.979 
card you need to tell the difference
usually<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.849> wireless<00:02:49.269> cover<00:02:49.510> will<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.840> an

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
usually a wireless cover will have an

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.390 
usually a wireless cover will have an
antenna<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.790> course<00:02:52.000> there's<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.569> RAM

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
antenna and of course there's the RAM

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.970 
antenna and of course there's the RAM
completely<00:02:54.400> different<00:02:57.030> from<00:02:58.030> there<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:59.799> just
