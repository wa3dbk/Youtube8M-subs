 deficiency that was lacking for me 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.220
 gaucho horse I put on the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.040
 paper 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.290
 What I would like to have hands on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.240
 said they will go together 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.310
 cervan raw ripe a diffuse morning 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 I learned on account had a stimulus of 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.020
 my uncle, I want it here right now, it's a 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.670
 drew the same gauche style 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.860
 horse and once gave me something with 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.220
 the marenco ELEODORO which is an Argentine 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.369

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 He is the master of the masters and I 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.569
 line and practicing practicing half the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 I'm stubborn, but I've never taken a course 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.280
 nothing learns like that on account 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.980
 we both together with the horse 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 living with the horse living with 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.360
 People like this all have more pictures in 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.970
 retina because I always drew 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.760
 It's memory, I came here for example. 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.130
 stored in the head and then when 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.020
 home and put on paper those 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.660
 things that will be stored right then 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.560
 tutano conviviality both together running you 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.840
 It has a much stronger experience 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.960
 said that the river ahead and the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.890
 present thought drifted away from 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.890
 to communicate 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:31.220
 his gaze was a bomb surviving river 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.250

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.140
 treats the purity of our race 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.660
 Gaucho authenticity right in a medium 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.610
 globalized tamir I think it has to be 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.700
 look for a way to follow our 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.700
 tradition
