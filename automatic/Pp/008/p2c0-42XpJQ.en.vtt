welcome<00:00:00.840> back<00:00:01.020> sethbling<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.060> I've<00:00:03.060> got

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
welcome back sethbling here and I've got

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.420 
welcome back sethbling here and I've got
a<00:00:03.300> set<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.629> three<00:00:04.020> axes<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:04.830> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.370> to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
a set of three axes here I'm going to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.909 
a set of three axes here I'm going to
use<00:00:05.520> them<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.790> do<00:00:05.910> some<00:00:06.120> 3d<00:00:06.270> graphing<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.589> let's

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
use them to do some 3d graphing so let's

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.129 
use them to do some 3d graphing so let's
go<00:00:08.040> ahead<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.280> press<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.150> reset<00:00:09.570> button<00:00:09.630> here

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
go ahead and press the reset button here

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
go ahead and press the reset button here
it'll<00:00:10.769> reset<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.790> plane<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.389> then<00:00:12.660> it'll

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
it'll reset the plane and then it'll

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.020 
it'll reset the plane and then it'll
tell<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.290> list<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.740> five<00:00:14.009> equations<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
tell me a list of five equations that it

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
tell me a list of five equations that it
knows<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> draw<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.320> let's<00:00:16.500> start<00:00:16.740> with

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
knows how to draw so let's start with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.859 
knows how to draw so let's start with
the<00:00:16.890> first<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.220> x<00:00:17.430> squared<00:00:17.550> y<00:00:18.420> equals<00:00:18.720> x

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the first one x squared y equals x

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.300 
the first one x squared y equals x
squared<00:00:18.990> minus<00:00:19.410> Z<00:00:19.439> squared<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.949> I'll<00:00:20.039> just

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
squared minus Z squared and I'll just

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.170 
squared minus Z squared and I'll just
click<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.680> there<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.939> looks<00:00:23.939> pretty

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
click on it and there we go looks pretty

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.259 
click on it and there we go looks pretty
cool<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.529> call<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> saddle

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
cool this is what we call a saddle

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
cool this is what we call a saddle
figure<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.439> kind<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> goes<00:00:28.830> curves

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
figure because it kind of goes curves

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.370 
figure because it kind of goes curves
upward<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.269> direction<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.929> downwards

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
upward in this direction and downwards

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.650 
upward in this direction and downwards
in<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> other<00:00:32.070> direction<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:33.329> kind<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
in the other direction you can kind of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830 
in the other direction you can kind of
go<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> blocks<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.660> look<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
go through the blocks and look at it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
go through the blocks and look at it
from<00:00:36.930> any<00:00:37.079> angle<00:00:37.170> actually<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> pretty<00:00:38.160> good

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
from any angle actually a pretty good

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
from any angle actually a pretty good
visualization<00:00:38.670> tool<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.270> let's<00:00:40.200> look<00:00:40.350> at

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
visualization tool I think let's look at

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
visualization tool I think let's look at
some<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> other<00:00:40.829> equations<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.090> X<00:00:42.270> X

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
some of the other equations we have X X

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590 
some of the other equations we have X X
cubed<00:00:43.410> times<00:00:43.680> Z<00:00:43.950> plus<00:00:44.309> Z<00:00:44.340> cubed<00:00:44.879> times<00:00:45.120> X<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
cubed times Z plus Z cubed times X and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
cubed times Z plus Z cubed times X and
this<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.320> gonna<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.530> another<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.190> saddle

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
this is gonna be another kind of saddle

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.110 
this is gonna be another kind of saddle
figure<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.390> direction<00:00:50.120> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
figure but in the other direction this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
figure but in the other direction this
is<00:00:51.180> my<00:00:51.390> favorite<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.780> sine<00:00:52.140> 20<00:00:52.710> X<00:00:52.920> plus<00:00:53.399> cosine

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is my favorite one sine 20 X plus cosine

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.779 
is my favorite one sine 20 X plus cosine
20<00:00:54.390> Z<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> sine<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.920> cosine<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.399> both<00:00:56.520> wavy

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
20 Z and sine and cosine are both wavy

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.979 
20 Z and sine and cosine are both wavy
this<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.180> takes<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.629> longer<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this one takes a little bit longer to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.490 
this one takes a little bit longer to
calculate<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> yeah<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.989> looks<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> looks

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
calculate but yeah this looks this looks

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.979 
calculate but yeah this looks this looks
really<00:01:01.800> cool<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.359> it's<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.449> wavy<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
really cool I think it's that wavy in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
really cool I think it's that wavy in
both<00:01:04.170> what<00:01:04.650> both<00:01:04.890> dimensions<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
both what both dimensions so this one is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200 
both what both dimensions so this one is
the<00:01:06.750> sine<00:01:07.080> dimension<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.970> one's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the sine dimension and then this one's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.920 
the sine dimension and then this one's
the<00:01:09.360> cosine<00:01:09.780> dimension<00:01:10.909> next<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.060> 1<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:12.780> x

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the cosine dimension next one 1 over x

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.190 
the cosine dimension next one 1 over x
squared<00:01:13.049> plus<00:01:13.590> Z<00:01:14.220> squared<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.020> looks

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
squared plus Z squared so this one looks

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
squared plus Z squared so this one looks
kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.740> volcano<00:01:17.119> these<00:01:18.119> curves

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
kind of like a volcano these curves

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.880 
kind of like a volcano these curves
would<00:01:18.689> keep<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.290> except<00:01:19.680> there's<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
would keep going up except there's a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.440 
would keep going up except there's a
limit<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.520> high<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.150> render<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
limit of how high I can render the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.140 
limit of how high I can render the
blocks<00:01:21.950> just<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> their<00:01:23.400> limitations

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
blocks just because of their limitations

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.590 
blocks just because of their limitations
of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> system<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.229> built<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.450> kind

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of the system that I built so so it kind

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
of the system that I built so so it kind
of<00:01:27.630> cuts<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> off<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.619> keep<00:01:28.799> going

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
of cuts it off but it would keep going

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.510 
of cuts it off but it would keep going
up<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.450> able<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
up if it if it was able to and then the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.359 
up if it if it was able to and then the
last<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.909> coasts<00:01:33.360> y<00:01:33.600> equals<00:01:33.869> cosine<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.350> 40<00:01:34.950> x

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
last one coasts y equals cosine of 40 x

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
last one coasts y equals cosine of 40 x
squared<00:01:35.939> x<00:01:36.240> squared<00:01:36.299> plus<00:01:36.720> Z<00:01:36.840> squared<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
squared x squared plus Z squared and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
squared x squared plus Z squared and
this<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> look<00:01:38.369> wavy<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this is going to look wavy kind of like

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.219 
this is going to look wavy kind of like
the<00:01:39.930> other<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.220> based<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.780> ripples<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> or

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the other one based on ripples but or

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.429 
the other one based on ripples but or
cosine<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> ripple

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cosine but so this one has like a ripple

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
cosine but so this one has like a ripple
effect<00:01:46.950> you've<00:01:47.430> drop<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> middle<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
effect you've drop in the middle and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.910 
effect you've drop in the middle and
then<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> ripple<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.409> around<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
then a ripple going on around it and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
then a ripple going on around it and
actually<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:50.970> able<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> render

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
actually if it was able to render

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.389 
actually if it was able to render
farther<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.649> each<00:01:52.770> direction<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.340> would

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
farther out in each direction you would

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.569 
farther out in each direction you would
see<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.729> ripples<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.340> cool

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
see more ripples and so pretty cool

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.600 
see more ripples and so pretty cool
graphing<00:01:57.149> system<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> I'll<00:01:59.219> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.460> go

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
graphing system and so I'll kind of go

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
graphing system and so I'll kind of go
over<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.030> each<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> these

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
over what each of these this is these

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.280 
over what each of these this is these
are<00:02:01.469> command<00:02:01.710> blocks<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:04.020> run<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
are command blocks that that run the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
are command blocks that that run the
whole<00:02:04.439> system<00:02:04.770> I'll<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.579> over<00:02:05.820> what

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
whole system I'll kind of go over what

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.570 
whole system I'll kind of go over what
each<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> lines<00:02:06.750> does<00:02:07.340> but<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
each of the lines does but not the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
each of the lines does but not the
particular<00:02:08.819> commands<00:02:09.330> involved<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.840> each<00:02:09.989> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
particular commands involved in each so

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500 
particular commands involved in each so
down<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> reset<00:02:11.700> line

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
down here this is the reset line

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.880 
down here this is the reset line
and<00:02:12.629> when<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> click<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.409> can<00:02:13.439> see<00:02:13.769> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and when I click it you can see it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.690 
and when I click it you can see it
resets<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:15.689> whole<00:02:16.159> graphing<00:02:17.159> surface

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
resets the the whole graphing surface

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.059 
resets the the whole graphing surface
and<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.150> tells<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.079> bunch<00:02:19.439> of<00:02:19.590> equations

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and then tells me a bunch of equations

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.800 
and then tells me a bunch of equations
that<00:02:20.159> it's<00:02:20.370> able<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.610> render<00:02:20.909> so<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.689> can

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that it's able to render so that I can

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.039 
that it's able to render so that I can
click<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.079> those<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.849> okay<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:24.239> clock

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
click on those and okay so this clock

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.530 
click on those and okay so this clock
right<00:02:25.349> here<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.950> involved<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.879> resetting

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
right here is involved in resetting

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.500 
right here is involved in resetting
basically<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.650> goes<00:02:29.610> line<00:02:29.879> by<00:02:30.060> line<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
basically it goes line by line and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.800 
basically it goes line by line and
summons<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.019> these<00:02:31.950> armorstands<00:02:32.760> these<00:02:33.629> are

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
summons in these armorstands these are

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.330 
summons in these armorstands these are
of<00:02:33.900> course<00:02:33.930> armor<00:02:34.379> stands<00:02:34.560> game<00:02:34.829> mode<00:02:34.980> three

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
of course armor stands game mode three

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.789 
of course armor stands game mode three
you<00:02:35.849> can<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.140> bunch<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.379> armor<00:02:37.620> stands

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
you can see just a bunch of armor stands

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.539 
you can see just a bunch of armor stands
wearing<00:02:38.099> down<00:02:38.280> block<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.730> their<00:02:38.909> head<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.409> so

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
wearing down block on their head and so

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.179 
wearing down block on their head and so
when<00:02:41.549> I<00:02:41.579> push<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.000> button<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.709> clock<00:02:43.920> turns

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
when I push this button the clock turns

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.300 
when I push this button the clock turns
on<00:02:44.459> by<00:02:44.909> by<00:02:45.900> having<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.349> block<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:46.980> when

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
on by by having a block here and when

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.949 
on by by having a block here and when
the<00:02:47.400> reset<00:02:47.700> procedure<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.239> done<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.629> turns<00:02:48.840> on

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the reset procedure is done it turns on

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.920 
the reset procedure is done it turns on
this<00:02:49.170> clock<00:02:49.500> which<00:02:50.280> then<00:02:50.579> listens<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:51.329> when

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
this clock which then listens for when

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.750 
this clock which then listens for when
the<00:02:52.049> player<00:02:52.260> clicks<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.099> one<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.120> these<00:02:55.730> one<00:02:56.730> of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
the player clicks on one of these one of

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.160 
the player clicks on one of these one of
these<00:02:56.879> chat<00:02:57.299> messages<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:59.120> then<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.959> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
these chat messages and then so this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470 
these chat messages and then so this
listens<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.519> listens<00:03:02.879> for<00:03:02.970> when

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
listens for this one listens for when

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.410 
listens for this one listens for when
they<00:03:03.569> click<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.760> calls<00:03:06.060> these

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
they click on it and it's it calls these

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.339 
they click on it and it's it calls these
kind<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.139> functions<00:03:07.620> up<00:03:07.920> above<00:03:08.280> -<00:03:09.269> well<00:03:10.049> these

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
kind of functions up above - well these

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.360 
kind of functions up above - well these
five<00:03:10.739> functions<00:03:11.340> here<00:03:11.819> these<00:03:12.450> five<00:03:12.690> lines

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
five functions here these five lines

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.740 
five functions here these five lines
basically<00:03:14.370> calculate<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.299> five<00:03:15.480> equations

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
basically calculate the five equations

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.319 
basically calculate the five equations
that<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.440> listed<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.069> then<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that I have listed and then the the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.869 
that I have listed and then the the
sixth<00:03:18.599> one<00:03:18.750> up<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.139> kind<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.829> renders<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.579> by

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
sixth one up here kind of renders it by

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.580 
sixth one up here kind of renders it by
putting<00:03:21.419> all<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> armor<00:03:22.139> stands<00:03:22.349> in<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
putting all the armor stands in the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.409 
putting all the armor stands in the
right<00:03:22.739> position<00:03:23.190> according<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.150> their<00:03:24.269> Y

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
right position according to their Y

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.849 
right position according to their Y
value<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:26.629> so<00:03:27.629> each<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.109> these<00:03:28.349> this<00:03:28.620> like

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
value and so each of these this like

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.159 
value and so each of these this like
this<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> first<00:03:29.819> function<00:03:30.269> which<00:03:30.449> is<00:03:30.660> x

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
this is the first function which is x

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.920 
this is the first function which is x
squared<00:03:31.410> minus<00:03:32.160> Z<00:03:32.430> squared<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
squared minus Z squared this is the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.569 
squared minus Z squared this is the
second<00:03:34.319> function<00:03:34.470> X<00:03:34.859> cubed<00:03:35.220> whatever

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
second function X cubed whatever

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.900 
second function X cubed whatever
whatever<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:37.549> weight<00:03:38.549> actually<00:03:38.730> I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
whatever so this one weight actually I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.520 
whatever so this one weight actually I
think<00:03:39.000> they're<00:03:39.150> out<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.299> order<00:03:39.629> but<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.500> I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
think they're out of order but but I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.259 
think they're out of order but but I
think<00:03:40.859> this<00:03:41.040> one<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.250> actually<00:03:41.549> yeah<00:03:42.150> this

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
think this one is actually yeah this

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.869 
think this one is actually yeah this
one's<00:03:42.480> signed<00:03:42.780> 20<00:03:43.290> X<00:03:43.440> plus<00:03:43.709> cosine<00:03:43.889> 20<00:03:44.430> Z<00:03:44.669> and

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
one's signed 20 X plus cosine 20 Z and

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.659 
one's signed 20 X plus cosine 20 Z and
so<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.750> actually<00:03:46.109> have<00:03:46.410> an<00:03:46.739> approximation<00:03:47.340> of

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
so I actually have an approximation of

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.819 
so I actually have an approximation of
sine<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:47.940> cosine<00:03:48.299> built<00:03:49.169> into<00:03:49.410> these<00:03:49.530> command

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
sine and cosine built into these command

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.979 
sine and cosine built into these command
blocks<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.340> then<00:03:50.879> similarly<00:03:51.209> for<00:03:51.419> this<00:03:51.780> one

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
blocks and then similarly for this one

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:52.640 
blocks and then similarly for this one
up<00:03:52.139> here

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
up here

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.740 
up here
this<00:03:53.010> one<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:55.280> cosine<00:03:56.280> 40<00:03:56.909> x<00:03:57.150> squared<00:03:57.599> x

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
this one is the cosine 40 x squared x

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.270 
this one is the cosine 40 x squared x
squared<00:03:57.810> plus<00:03:58.169> Z<00:03:58.290> squared<00:03:58.319> there<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.159> an

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
squared plus Z squared there is an

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.569 
squared plus Z squared there is an
approximation<00:03:59.819> for<00:04:00.440> square<00:04:01.440> root<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.919> also

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
approximation for square root and also

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.640 
approximation for square root and also
cosine<00:04:03.000> built<00:04:03.299> into<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.599> one<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.349> I<00:04:04.379> looked

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
cosine built into this one so I looked

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.470 
cosine built into this one so I looked
up<00:04:04.799> some<00:04:05.190> approximations<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:06.000> those<00:04:06.209> things

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
up some approximations for those things

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.689 
up some approximations for those things
online<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.919> would<00:04:08.069> have<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.519> pretty

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
online so that I would have a pretty

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:09.830 
online so that I would have a pretty
good<00:04:08.879> approximation<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.479> does<00:04:09.629> work<00:04:09.810> pretty

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
good approximation it does work pretty

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.369 
good approximation it does work pretty
well<00:04:10.079> actually<00:04:10.440> if<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.370> go<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:12.090> mean<00:04:12.959> the

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
well actually if we go to the I mean the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.860 
well actually if we go to the I mean the
fact<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.909> this<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.389> curve<00:04:15.720> is

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
fact that that that this this curve is

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.509 
fact that that that this this curve is
so<00:04:16.019> smooth<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:17.239> appears<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.299> be<00:04:18.979> very<00:04:19.979> regular

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
so smooth and appears to be very regular

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.550 
so smooth and appears to be very regular
I<00:04:20.729> think<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.690> approximations<00:04:22.169> are<00:04:22.380> quite

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I think the approximations are quite

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.430 
I think the approximations are quite
good<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.729> then<00:04:23.909> so<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.300> last<00:04:24.719> so<00:04:25.050> basically

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
good and then so the last so basically

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.420 
good and then so the last so basically
each<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.710> these

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
each of these

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.430 
each of these
each<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.699> these<00:04:26.760> armorstands<00:04:27.330> has<00:04:27.540> its<00:04:27.900> own<00:04:28.080> X

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
each of these armorstands has its own X

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.920 
each of these armorstands has its own X
and<00:04:28.740> Z<00:04:28.919> value<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.610> everything<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.690> row

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
and Z value so everything in this row

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.860 
and Z value so everything in this row
has<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.229> Z<00:04:31.500> value<00:04:31.889> of<00:04:32.190> negative<00:04:32.970> 10<00:04:33.240> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
has a Z value of negative 10 the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.990 
has a Z value of negative 10 the
negative<00:04:34.229> 9<00:04:34.380> negative<00:04:34.410> 8<00:04:34.979> we<00:04:35.220> go<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> here<00:04:35.850> this

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
negative 9 negative 8 we go to here this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.980 
negative 9 negative 8 we go to here this
is<00:04:36.150> 0<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:36.960> then<00:04:37.560> up<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.889> 10<00:04:38.070> same<00:04:38.400> thing<00:04:38.639> for<00:04:38.820> X

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
is 0 and then up to 10 same thing for X

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.070 
is 0 and then up to 10 same thing for X
scores<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.949> other<00:04:41.070> dimension<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:42.080> so

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
scores in the other dimension and so

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.140 
scores in the other dimension and so
then<00:04:43.260> we<00:04:43.530> calculate<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.070> y-value<00:04:44.340> for<00:04:44.940> each<00:04:45.000> of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
then we calculate a y-value for each of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.850 
then we calculate a y-value for each of
these<00:04:45.210> in<00:04:45.479> fact<00:04:45.630> by<00:04:45.840> scoreboard<00:04:46.320> objectives

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
these in fact by scoreboard objectives

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.930 
these in fact by scoreboard objectives
set<00:04:47.070> display<00:04:47.400> side<00:04:48.180> bar<00:04:48.389> y<00:04:48.600> we'll<00:04:49.020> see<00:04:49.880> why<00:04:50.880> are

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
set display side bar y we'll see why are

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.879 
set display side bar y we'll see why are
they<00:04:51.090> all<00:04:51.210> 0<00:04:52.460> I'm<00:04:53.630> not<00:04:54.630> actually<00:04:54.840> sure<00:04:55.050> let's

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
they all 0 I'm not actually sure let's

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.600 
they all 0 I'm not actually sure let's
let's<00:04:56.820> uh<00:04:56.940> players<00:04:57.600> reset<00:04:58.590> start<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.280> let's

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
let's uh players reset start with let's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.909 
let's uh players reset start with let's
say<00:04:59.850> there<00:05:00.720> might<00:05:00.900> be<00:05:00.930> some<00:05:01.229> old<00:05:01.410> armorstand

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
say there might be some old armorstand

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.400 
say there might be some old armorstand
sitting<00:05:02.220> around<00:05:02.539> so<00:05:03.539> let's<00:05:03.750> let's<00:05:04.020> reset<00:05:04.350> it

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
sitting around so let's let's reset it

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.409 
sitting around so let's let's reset it
and<00:05:04.590> try<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.800> again<00:05:04.919> and<00:05:05.220> see<00:05:06.030> if<00:05:06.120> those<00:05:06.240> Y

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
and try it again and see if those Y

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.830 
and try it again and see if those Y
values<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:08.430> um<00:05:08.699> get<00:05:09.300> put<00:05:09.449> where<00:05:09.570> they<00:05:09.600> should

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
values get um get put where they should

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.890 
values get um get put where they should
be<00:05:09.960> so<00:05:10.229> let's<00:05:10.680> do<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.940> thing<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.810> takes

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
be so let's do that this thing it takes

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.510 
be so let's do that this thing it takes
a<00:05:13.050> while<00:05:13.169> to<00:05:13.199> calculate<00:05:13.770> all<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.160> sines<00:05:14.370> and

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
a while to calculate all the sines and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.000 
a while to calculate all the sines and
cosines<00:05:14.610> all<00:05:15.449> right<00:05:15.870> actually<00:05:16.110> as<00:05:16.590> part<00:05:16.949> of

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
cosines all right actually as part of

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.000 
cosines all right actually as part of
the<00:05:17.130> drawing<00:05:17.370> procedure<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:19.199> Y<00:05:19.410> values<00:05:19.830> I'll

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
the drawing procedure the Y values I'll

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.520 
the drawing procedure the Y values I'll
get<00:05:20.160> set<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.490> 0<00:05:20.760> as<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.270> sort<00:05:21.479> of<00:05:21.539> as<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.289> sort<00:05:22.470> of

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
get set to 0 as it sort of as it sort of

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.020 
get set to 0 as it sort of as it sort of
tweaks<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:23.010> blocks<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.580> right<00:05:23.729> place

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
tweaks the blocks in the right place

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.140 
tweaks the blocks in the right place
it's<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:25.470> it's<00:05:25.889> attracts<00:05:26.340> values<00:05:26.760> from<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.030> Y

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
it's a it's attracts values from the Y

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.290 
it's a it's attracts values from the Y
score<00:05:27.449> so<00:05:27.720> that's<00:05:28.050> why<00:05:28.289> that's<00:05:29.250> why<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.910> Y

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
score so that's why that's why the Y

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.409 
score so that's why that's why the Y
scores<00:05:30.630> are<00:05:30.750> all<00:05:30.810> 0<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.349> anyway<00:05:32.030> ok<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.060> wasn't

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
scores are all 0 but anyway ok I wasn't

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.120 
scores are all 0 but anyway ok I wasn't
really<00:05:33.539> good<00:05:33.720> demonstration<00:05:34.470> but<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.010> get

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
really good demonstration but you get

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.089 
really good demonstration but you get
the<00:05:35.250> idea<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:36.139> and<00:05:37.139> so<00:05:37.320> yeah<00:05:37.440> it<00:05:37.500> renders<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
the idea and and so yeah it renders it

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.219 
the idea and and so yeah it renders it
renders<00:05:38.490> places<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.330> armorstands<00:05:39.930> according

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
renders places the armorstands according

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.230 
renders places the armorstands according
to<00:05:40.349> their<00:05:40.440> Y<00:05:40.560> value<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.400> that's<00:05:41.910> pretty<00:05:42.150> much

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
to their Y value and that's pretty much

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.810 
to their Y value and that's pretty much
how<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:42.419> works<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:43.590> I<00:05:43.860> think<00:05:44.070> it's<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.430> really

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
how it works so I think it's a really

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.310 
how it works so I think it's a really
cool<00:05:44.910> visualization<00:05:45.510> tool<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.200> could

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
cool visualization tool it could

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.529 
cool visualization tool it could
actually<00:05:46.470> be<00:05:46.650> useful<00:05:47.010> to<00:05:47.099> people<00:05:47.389> doing<00:05:48.389> their

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
actually be useful to people doing their

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.180 
actually be useful to people doing their
math<00:05:48.960> homework<00:05:49.169> or<00:05:49.410> whatever<00:05:49.470> so<00:05:49.919> if<00:05:50.070> you'd

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
math homework or whatever so if you'd

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.800 
math homework or whatever so if you'd
like<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.370> download<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.150> take<00:05:51.599> a<00:05:51.630> look<00:05:51.780> for

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
like to download it and take a look for

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.830 
like to download it and take a look for
yourself<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.729> see<00:05:53.729> all<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.120> math<00:05:54.539> that<00:05:54.720> I've

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
yourself and see all the math that I've

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.540 
yourself and see all the math that I've
done<00:05:55.050> here<00:05:55.440> there's<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.190> link<00:05:56.310> of<00:05:56.430> a

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
done here there's a link of a

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.010 
done here there's a link of a
description<00:05:56.880> and<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.419> can<00:05:57.449> check<00:05:57.630> it<00:05:57.750> out

description and you can check it out

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:12.390 
description and you can check it out
it's<00:05:58.620> about<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.889> thanks<00:05:59.250> for<00:05:59.280> watching
