let's try to say white metal or soft

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.920 
let's try to say white metal or soft
aluminum<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.659> does<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> positive<00:01:25.560> stops

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
aluminum it does have the positive stops

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.270 
aluminum it does have the positive stops
you<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:27.960> maybe<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> teeth

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you see maybe you can see with the teeth

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
you see maybe you can see with the teeth
in<00:01:29.460> there

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
in there

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
in there
so<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> crank<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.829> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so when you crank this in there it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.010 
so when you crank this in there it's
gonna<00:01:32.159> walk<00:01:32.460> without<00:01:32.820> having<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.420> roll<00:01:33.810> rotate

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
gonna walk without having to roll rotate

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.440 
gonna walk without having to roll rotate
this<00:01:37.020> thumb<00:01:37.380> screw<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:39.140> plastic<00:01:41.030> if<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.299> was

this thumb screw is plastic if that was
to<00:01:42.570> break<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.960> probably<00:01:43.350> could<00:01:43.619> use

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
to break you probably could use

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
to break you probably could use
something<00:01:46.799> else<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.570> win<00:01:48.570> knot<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:48.960> something

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
something else to win knot or something

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.050

screw at the bottom of this for you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.480 
screw at the bottom of this for you
there<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:55.960> guys<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.440> might<00:04:56.889> get<00:04:57.039> confused

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
there you guys that might get confused

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.960 
there you guys that might get confused
that<00:04:57.910> screw<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.539> a<00:04:58.630> stop<00:04:58.990> sto<00:04:59.680> P<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.820> this

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
that screw is just a stop sto P so this

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.730 
that screw is just a stop sto P so this

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
think just with no screws and you put

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.370 
think just with no screws and you put
this<00:06:20.380> little<00:06:20.650> rubber<00:06:21.090> track<00:06:22.090> there<00:06:22.380> sometimes
