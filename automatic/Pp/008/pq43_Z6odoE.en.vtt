at the click of an orange button the
best<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.409> through<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> course<00:01:04.979> is

than<00:01:07.830> 2<00:01:08.040> 3<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.869> progressive

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
than 2 3 and so on it is progressive

each of the lessons are based on
material<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.500> came<00:01:13.710> before<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.430> prepared

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
material that came before that prepared

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
material that came before that prepared
you<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.650> okay<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> skip<00:01:17.490> around

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you so it's okay to skip around

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
you so it's okay to skip around
specially<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.119> you've<00:01:18.210> been<00:01:18.330> playing<00:01:18.600> some<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
specially if you've been playing some of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
specially if you've been playing some of
this<00:01:19.560> style<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> while<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> if

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this style for a while but know that if

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.060 
this style for a while but know that if
you<00:01:21.930> find<00:01:22.320> something<00:01:22.530> particularly

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you find something particularly

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.249 
you find something particularly
difficult<00:01:23.570> probably<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> thing<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
difficult probably the thing to do is to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
difficult probably the thing to do is to
go<00:01:25.470> back<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.770> watch<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> earlier

is<00:02:15.580> they're<00:02:15.849> not<00:02:16.090> connected<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.260> other<00:02:17.470> words

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
is they're not connected in other words

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
you could start here start doing this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.559 
you could start here start doing this
course<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:21.459> go<00:02:21.549> ahead<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.940> start<00:02:22.330> doing

course and then go ahead and start doing

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.809 
course and then go ahead and start doing
this<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.049> same<00:02:23.290> time<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:24.430> don't<00:02:24.580> have

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
this one at the same time you don't have

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.839 
this one at the same time you don't have
to<00:02:24.940> complete<00:02:25.269> one<00:02:25.510> or<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.720> other<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:27.580> going

to complete one or the other it's going
to<00:02:27.879> be<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> little<00:02:28.330> confusing<00:02:28.690> if<00:02:29.110> you're

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
to be a little confusing if you're

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.990 
to be a little confusing if you're
trying<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.650> actually<00:02:29.950> study<00:02:30.370> both<00:02:30.730> at<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
trying to actually study both at the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.699 
trying to actually study both at the
same<00:02:31.180> time<00:02:31.209> there<00:02:31.629> are<00:02:31.660> different<00:02:32.260> types<00:02:32.290> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
same time there are different types of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.240 
same time there are different types of
techniques<00:02:33.129> but<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.330> doable<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.799> can<00:02:36.010> start

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
techniques but it's doable you can start

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.710 
techniques but it's doable you can start
with<00:02:36.310> either<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.849> if<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.120> want<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.450> do<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
with either one if you want to do and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.979 
with either one if you want to do and
complete<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.260> or<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.890> them<00:02:38.980> concurrently<00:02:39.989> also

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
complete it or do them concurrently also

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.900 
complete it or do them concurrently also

more thing you should know that the last

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.470 
more thing you should know that the last
module<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.160> workshops<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.000> these<00:03:13.209> are<00:03:13.359> by

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
module is the workshops and these are by

each workshop is an extensive lesson
this<00:03:21.130> by<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.370> way<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.549> just<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.910> technique

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
this by the way is just a technique

this by the way is just a technique
lessons<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.170> fairly<00:03:23.889> short<00:03:24.100> lesson<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:24.670> these

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
lessons a fairly short lesson but these

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.000

based<00:03:29.799> upon<00:03:30.510> specific<00:03:31.510> songs<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.139> have

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
based upon specific songs that have

teach you in that song so there are a
lot<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.280> fun<00:03:36.579> but<00:03:37.299> if<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.480> jump<00:03:37.780> right<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.049> hear
