we've got ardent real supreme micro Lube

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.420 
we've got ardent real supreme micro Lube
it'll<00:02:17.330> actually<00:02:17.570> reduce<00:02:18.290> friction<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:18.950> there

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it'll actually reduce friction and there

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120 
it'll actually reduce friction and there
the<00:02:19.550> 30%<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:20.810> really<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.380> good<00:02:21.709> stuff

the<00:02:22.700> final<00:02:23.180> step<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> take<00:02:24.770> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
the final step that I do is I take the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.090 
the final step that I do is I take the
bearing<00:02:25.310> Lube<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.880> work<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.990> one<00:02:27.770> thing<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
bearing Lube I work it in one thing to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.949 
bearing Lube I work it in one thing to

actually make a real noisier put a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300 
actually make a real noisier put a
little<00:02:35.480> bit<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.140> there<00:02:36.320> then<00:02:37.190> I'm

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
little bit of that in there then I'm

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.120 
little bit of that in there then I'm
ready<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.670> reassemble<00:02:38.330> my<00:02:38.750> reel<00:02:39.140> let<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
handle back in tighten everything up

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.860 
handle back in tighten everything up
handles<00:02:44.840> ready<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.290> go<00:02:45.470> let<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.220> spool<00:02:46.870> back

down<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.800> shaft<00:02:49.100> make<00:02:50.000> sure<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.330> get<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
down on the shaft make sure you get it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.990 
down on the shaft make sure you get it
all<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.780> way<00:02:50.959> down<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.370> take<00:02:52.730> your

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
all the way down then you can take your

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.640 
all the way down then you can take your
drag<00:02:53.989> cap<00:02:54.910> screw<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.060> back<00:02:56.269> on<00:02:56.330> that's<00:02:57.290> all

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
drag cap screw it back on that's all

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.280 
drag cap screw it back on that's all
there<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:59.120> next<00:02:59.480> step<00:02:59.630> obviously

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
there is to it the next step obviously

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.550 
there is to it the next step obviously
is<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.100> condition

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560

I'm in a tournament I spool up I'll sit

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.020 
I'm in a tournament I spool up I'll sit
and<00:03:27.349> saturate<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.830> line<00:03:28.250> before<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.700> put<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
and saturate that line before I put the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.300 
and saturate that line before I put the
rod<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.780> reel<00:03:30.140> back<00:03:30.410> into<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.739> rod<00:03:30.920> Locker

rod and reel back into the rod Locker
and<00:03:31.760> what<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.120> does<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.959> gets<00:03:33.200> rid<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.470> memory

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
and what this does it gets rid of memory

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.430 
and what this does it gets rid of memory
it<00:03:34.250> gets<00:03:34.519> rid<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.819> lying<00:03:35.120> twists<00:03:35.630> gives<00:03:36.290> you

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
it gets rid of lying twists gives you

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.250 
it gets rid of lying twists gives you
more<00:03:36.620> casting<00:03:37.250> distance<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:38.239> works<00:03:38.600> equally

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
more casting distance this works equally

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.160 
more casting distance this works equally
well<00:03:39.290> with<00:03:39.769> monofilament<00:03:40.780> fluorocarbon<00:03:41.780> or

boat without the line butter very very
good<00:03:53.540> stuff<00:03:53.840> it'll<00:03:54.380> take<00:03:54.680> away<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.430> lot<00:03:55.670> of
