00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
interested in doing Western releases and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450

and I would say that since both games

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
and I would say that since both games
have<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.560> released<00:01:26.299> additional

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
idea of these games being MMORPGs but I

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.770 
idea of these games being MMORPGs but I
am<00:02:59.920> upholding<00:03:00.340> judgment<00:03:01.090> until<00:03:01.330> these<00:03:01.450> games

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
am upholding judgment until these games

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
am upholding judgment until these games

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
looks to me like in both cases for

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
looks to me like in both cases for
lineage<00:03:06.670> eternal<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.300> Lost<00:03:07.570> Ark<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.350> it's

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
lineage eternal and Lost Ark there it's

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.680

locking<00:04:03.790> may<00:04:04.030> be<00:04:04.090> an<00:04:04.330> issue<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:04.780> these<00:04:04.900> games

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
locking may be an issue with these games

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
locking may be an issue with these games
but<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:06.220> not<00:04:06.430> seen<00:04:07.090> any<00:04:07.420> evidence<00:04:07.900> that

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
confirms that these are in fact going to

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.220 
confirms that these are in fact going to
be<00:04:11.890> gender<00:04:12.190> lock<00:04:12.459> classes<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.660> kind<00:04:14.110> of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
be gender lock classes and so kind of

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
be gender lock classes and so kind of
like<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.530> was<00:04:14.680> saying<00:04:14.890> before<00:04:15.010> I'm<00:04:15.580> holding

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
judgment and we will see as we get

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.490 
judgment and we will see as we get
closer<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.970> an<00:04:19.090> actual<00:04:19.270> release<00:04:19.870> whether

closer to an actual release whether

these will have
gender<00:04:22.030> lock<00:04:22.240> classes<00:04:22.720> or<00:04:23.140> not<00:04:23.590> after<00:04:24.310> all

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
with their classes and then it seemed

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.580 
with their classes and then it seemed
like<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.540> game<00:04:31.780> was<00:04:31.930> gonna<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.260> gender
