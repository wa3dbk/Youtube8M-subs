like traditional metal caucuses on my
leader<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.390> times<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.750> creates<00:00:31.050> twist

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
leader a lot of times it creates twist

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.130 
leader a lot of times it creates twist
and<00:00:31.650> abrasion<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.750> doesn't<00:00:33.750> work<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.110> me

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and abrasion which doesn't work for me

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
and abrasion which doesn't work for me
so<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.399> set<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> build<00:00:36.210> basically<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so I I set out to build basically a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.319 
so I I set out to build basically a
better<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.530> better<00:00:37.680> trolling<00:00:38.370> lily<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.149> what

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
better a better trolling lily and what

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420 
better a better trolling lily and what
we<00:00:39.450> did<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:40.230> designed<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> lure<00:00:40.950> that's

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we did was we designed a lure that's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.360 
we did was we designed a lure that's
built<00:00:41.760> around<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.329> internal<00:00:42.719> two<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.370> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
built around an internal two and this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.270 
built around an internal two and this
tomb<00:00:45.320> allows<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.620> spinner<00:00:49.620> blade<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
tomb allows for the spinner blade to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
tomb allows for the spinner blade to
spin<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> tube<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.260> allows<00:00:52.530> us<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
spin on the tube and also allows us to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
spin on the tube and also allows us to
build<00:00:53.180> different<00:00:54.180> lawyers<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.079> different

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
build different lawyers for different

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
build different lawyers for different
species<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> take<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> look<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
species you can take a look at the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
species you can take a look at the
silicon<00:00:57.570> legs<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.710> different<00:00:59.039> beat

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
silicon legs of the different beat

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
silicon legs of the different beat
colors<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> actually<00:01:00.780> built<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
colors so we can actually built the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.609 
colors so we can actually built the
lower<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:02.030> four<00:01:03.170> different<00:01:04.170> species<00:01:04.320> like

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
lower for four different species like

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 
lower for four different species like
kokanee<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> some<00:01:05.549> other<00:01:05.700> lands<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
kokanee and some other lands is that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
kokanee and some other lands is that
those<00:01:07.200> rubber<00:01:07.470> legs<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.890> worked<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
those rubber legs really worked well and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
those rubber legs really worked well and
attracting<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> kokanee<00:01:09.510> oh<00:01:09.659> yeah<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.229> are

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
attracting the kokanee oh yeah these are

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.570 
attracting the kokanee oh yeah these are
believes<00:01:10.619> work<00:01:10.770> great<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.100> mean<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.400> lot<00:01:11.430> of

back<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.729> fished<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.329> lot<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.600> spinnerbaits<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
back so I fished a lot of spinnerbaits a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
back so I fished a lot of spinnerbaits a
lot<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.409> jigs<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.979> always<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.790> rubber<00:01:38.970> legs

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
lot of jigs and always put rubber legs

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.030 
lot of jigs and always put rubber legs
in<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:39.479> flies<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> fly<00:01:40.350> official<00:01:40.470> well

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

in my flies like to fly official well
there<00:01:41.369> aren't<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.700> kokanee<00:01:42.119> fishermen

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
there aren't a lot of kokanee fishermen

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
there aren't a lot of kokanee fishermen
it<00:01:42.659> ever<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.140> you'd<00:01:43.409> make<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> comparison

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it ever think you'd make a comparison

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
it ever think you'd make a comparison
between<00:01:44.250> baths<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.939> kokanee<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
between baths and kokanee but but it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
between baths and kokanee but but it
works<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.530> yeah<00:01:47.189> works<00:01:47.460> great<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
works really good yeah works great I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
could do with this internal to design is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
could do with this internal to design is
we<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.080> actually<00:02:40.110> hang<00:02:40.709> again<00:02:41.310> take<00:02:41.910> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
we can actually hang again take a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.530 
we can actually hang again take a
traditional<00:02:42.570> blade<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.700> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
traditional blade like that it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
traditional blade like that it's
actually<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> clevis<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> tube<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
actually on a clevis on the tube and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.100 
actually on a clevis on the tube and
then<00:02:47.370> sledded<00:02:47.850> down<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:48.480> top<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.930> your

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
then sledded down like on top of your

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.410 
then sledded down like on top of your
your<00:02:49.500> kokanee<00:02:49.890> fight<00:02:50.100> no<00:02:50.610> that's<00:02:50.850> that's<00:02:51.090> like

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
what the fish are doing on this you may

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
what the fish are doing on this you may
or<00:03:00.959> may<00:03:01.049> not<00:03:01.079> need<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.829> can<00:03:01.950> take<00:03:02.130> it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
off and you have kind of a modular

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.110 
off and you have kind of a modular
design<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.860> fits<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:05.820> different

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
design that fits the different

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.920
