00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
so impressive

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.550 
so impressive
a<00:06:31.819> couple<00:06:33.110> disappointments<00:06:34.110> well<00:06:34.289> at<00:06:34.379> least

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
a couple disappointments well at least

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.709 
a couple disappointments well at least
one<00:06:34.860> disappointment<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:35.819> that<00:06:35.849> you<00:06:36.300> cannot

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
one disappointment is that you cannot

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.369 
one disappointment is that you cannot
copy<00:06:37.199> files<00:06:37.740> from<00:06:38.430> an<00:06:38.580> SD<00:06:38.969> card<00:06:38.999> to<00:06:39.629> the

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
copy files from an SD card to the

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.129 
copy files from an SD card to the
SanDisk<00:06:41.009> storage<00:06:42.319> drive<00:06:43.699> using<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:44.819> app

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
SanDisk storage drive using the app

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.350 
SanDisk storage drive using the app
obviously<00:06:46.139> when<00:06:46.860> you<00:06:46.979> connect<00:06:47.340> this<00:06:47.520> by<00:06:47.789> USB

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
obviously when you connect this by USB

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.209 
obviously when you connect this by USB
to<00:06:48.419> your<00:06:48.599> computer<00:06:48.680> it's<00:06:49.680> going<00:06:49.919> to<00:06:49.979> mount

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
to your computer it's going to mount

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:53.420 
to your computer it's going to mount
this<00:06:50.460> device<00:06:50.909> and<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:52.050> SD<00:06:52.409> card<00:06:52.710> if<00:06:53.009> it's<00:06:53.250> been

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
this device and the SD card if it's been

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.869 
this device and the SD card if it's been
inserted<00:06:53.849> as<00:06:54.210> a<00:06:54.439> volume<00:06:55.439> on<00:06:55.770> your<00:06:56.009> computer<00:06:56.580> so

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
inserted as a volume on your computer so

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.480 
inserted as a volume on your computer so
at<00:06:57.029> that<00:06:57.180> point<00:06:57.509> it's<00:06:57.870> very<00:06:58.050> easy<00:06:58.680> for<00:06:59.069> you<00:06:59.189> to

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
at that point it's very easy for you to

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.909 
at that point it's very easy for you to
drag<00:06:59.819> files<00:07:00.180> from<00:07:00.659> the<00:07:00.810> media<00:07:01.080> drive<00:07:01.379> to<00:07:01.800> the

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
drag files from the media drive to the

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.700 
drag files from the media drive to the
SanDisk<00:07:02.430> media<00:07:02.819> drive<00:07:03.090> but<00:07:03.900> as<00:07:04.020> far<00:07:04.289> as<00:07:04.319> just

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
SanDisk media drive but as far as just

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.499 
SanDisk media drive but as far as just
being<00:07:04.919> able<00:07:05.069> to<00:07:05.219> do<00:07:05.430> it<00:07:05.460> within<00:07:05.759> the<00:07:05.939> app<00:07:06.180> that

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
being able to do it within the app that

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.589 
being able to do it within the app that
is<00:07:06.689> not<00:07:06.719> possible<00:07:07.490> perhaps<00:07:08.490> I<00:07:09.180> would<00:07:09.389> hope

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
is not possible perhaps I would hope

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.110 
is not possible perhaps I would hope
that<00:07:09.840> maybe<00:07:10.020> in<00:07:10.229> a<00:07:10.319> future<00:07:10.529> firmware<00:07:11.219> upgrade

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
that maybe in a future firmware upgrade

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.929 
that maybe in a future firmware upgrade
that<00:07:12.330> would<00:07:12.599> be<00:07:12.750> a<00:07:12.779> possibility<00:07:13.409> a<00:07:14.250> great

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:14.939 
that would be a possibility a great

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.600 
that would be a possibility a great
feature<00:07:15.270> of<00:07:15.419> this<00:07:15.750> as<00:07:16.080> you<00:07:16.289> can<00:07:17.159> have<00:07:17.430> this

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
feature of this as you can have this

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.629 
feature of this as you can have this
hooked<00:07:17.909> up<00:07:18.089> to<00:07:18.270> USB<00:07:18.810> power<00:07:19.310> while<00:07:20.310> it<00:07:20.520> is

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 
hooked up to USB power while it is

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.360 
hooked up to USB power while it is
working<00:07:21.180> so<00:07:22.909> downside<00:07:23.909> is<00:07:24.210> that<00:07:24.539> you<00:07:24.719> cannot

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
working so downside is that you cannot

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.550 
working so downside is that you cannot
have<00:07:26.370> this<00:07:26.610> hooked<00:07:26.909> up<00:07:27.120> to<00:07:27.330> USB<00:07:27.839> as<00:07:28.080> a<00:07:28.110> mounted

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 
have this hooked up to USB as a mounted

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.980 
have this hooked up to USB as a mounted
volume<00:07:28.919> on<00:07:29.069> your<00:07:29.099> computer<00:07:29.819> and<00:07:30.000> use<00:07:30.779> the

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
volume on your computer and use the

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.379 
volume on your computer and use the
Wi-Fi<00:07:31.279> capability<00:07:32.279> of<00:07:32.400> this<00:07:32.520> simultaneously

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
Wi-Fi capability of this simultaneously

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.839 
Wi-Fi capability of this simultaneously
so<00:07:34.110> this<00:07:34.289> has<00:07:34.469> to<00:07:34.650> be<00:07:34.680> disconnected<00:07:35.310> from<00:07:35.550> your

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
so this has to be disconnected from your

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.510 
so this has to be disconnected from your
computer<00:07:36.389> as<00:07:37.110> a<00:07:37.169> mounted<00:07:37.710> volume<00:07:37.919> in<00:07:38.279> order

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
computer as a mounted volume in order

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.230 
computer as a mounted volume in order
for<00:07:38.699> the<00:07:38.759> Wi-Fi<00:07:39.210> to<00:07:39.270> work<00:07:39.659> I<00:07:40.789> just<00:07:41.789> realized

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 
for the Wi-Fi to work I just realized

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.689 
for the Wi-Fi to work I just realized
that<00:07:42.419> this<00:07:42.629> is<00:07:42.839> a<00:07:42.870> aluminum<00:07:43.469> enclosure<00:07:43.889> and

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 
that this is a aluminum enclosure and

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.790 
that this is a aluminum enclosure and
that's<00:07:44.969> why<00:07:45.180> it<00:07:45.300> feels<00:07:45.389> so<00:07:45.930> substantial<00:07:46.710> and

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 
that's why it feels so substantial and

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.519 
that's why it feels so substantial and
so<00:07:47.039> nice<00:07:47.339> it's<00:07:48.060> a<00:07:48.180> very<00:07:48.419> solid<00:07:48.750> little<00:07:49.169> thing

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:49.529 
so nice it's a very solid little thing

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:51.740 
so nice it's a very solid little thing
and<00:07:49.889> it's<00:07:50.069> got<00:07:50.250> a<00:07:50.279> rubberized<00:07:50.610> bottom<00:07:51.029> it's

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
and it's got a rubberized bottom it's

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.439 
and it's got a rubberized bottom it's
just<00:07:51.839> beautifully<00:07:52.500> constructed<00:07:52.819> this<00:07:53.819> is<00:07:54.120> so

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.449 
just beautifully constructed this is so

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:57.110 
just beautifully constructed this is so
useful<00:07:54.719> to<00:07:55.080> me<00:07:55.199> I<00:07:55.439> just<00:07:56.099> almost<00:07:56.370> can't<00:07:56.789> stand

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 
useful to me I just almost can't stand

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.240 
useful to me I just almost can't stand
