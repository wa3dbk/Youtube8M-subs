777 flying pan okay so for those of you

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.360 
777 flying pan okay so for those of you
who<00:00:34.000> don't<00:00:34.180> exactly<00:00:34.570> know<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.200> flying<00:00:35.770> pan<00:00:36.100> is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
who don't exactly know the flying pan is

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.150 
who don't exactly know the flying pan is
a<00:00:36.400> phase<00:00:36.970> shifter<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:38.050> stereo<00:00:38.350> panner<00:00:38.860> at

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
a phase shifter and a stereo panner at

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.490 
a phase shifter and a stereo panner at
the<00:00:39.580> same<00:00:39.790> time<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.510> same<00:00:40.690> pedal<00:00:41.050> so

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
the same time in the same pedal so

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.320 
the same time in the same pedal so
that's<00:00:41.800> why<00:00:41.980> if<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.730> were<00:00:42.850> listening<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.210> the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
that's why if you were listening to the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's why if you were listening to the
intro<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.660> heard<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.680> back<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.129> forth<00:00:45.340> of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
intro you heard the back and forth of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.250 
intro you heard the back and forth of
the<00:00:45.550> panning<00:00:46.000> but<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.540> also<00:00:46.720> heard<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.080> phase

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
the panning but you also heard the phase

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.200 
the panning but you also heard the phase
shifting<00:00:47.590> at<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.739> same<00:00:47.949> time<00:00:48.160> okay<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:48.940> that's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
shifting at the same time okay so that's

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.840 
shifting at the same time okay so that's
out<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.600> way<00:00:49.629> more<00:00:50.410> importantly<00:00:50.949> this<00:00:51.670> is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
out of the way more importantly this is

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.520 
out of the way more importantly this is
a<00:00:51.879> classic<00:00:52.540> pedal<00:00:52.900> this<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.199> an<00:00:53.290> actual

mid<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.650> late<00:00:59.830> 70s<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.930> Ivan<00:01:01.930> has<00:01:02.049> reissued<00:01:02.530> it

in<00:01:02.739> 2008<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:03.820> they<00:01:03.970> made<00:01:04.409> 777<00:01:05.409> they<00:01:05.530> made<00:01:05.820> 777

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
in 2008 and they made 777 they made 777

in 2008 and they made 777 they made 777
of<00:01:06.940> them<00:01:07.030> hence<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.720> name<00:01:07.900> FP<00:01:08.670> 777<00:01:09.670> now<00:01:09.970> as<00:01:10.330> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
of them hence the name FP 777 now as the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.899 
of them hence the name FP 777 now as the
story<00:01:10.780> continues<00:01:11.470> these<00:01:12.190> are<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.549> last<00:01:12.729> few

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
story continues these are the last few

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.060 
story continues these are the last few
Sweetwater<00:01:13.659> has<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.049> last<00:01:14.290> few<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.619> them<00:01:14.890> and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
Sweetwater has the last few of them and

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.030 
Sweetwater has the last few of them and
so<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.510> say<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.930> limited<00:01:17.290> run<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.830> an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
so to say it's a limited run is an

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.530 
so to say it's a limited run is an
understatement<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.820> is<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.150> if<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.420> ever

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
understatement this is it if you ever

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.719 
understatement this is it if you ever
had<00:01:19.780> your<00:01:19.900> eye<00:01:19.960> on<00:01:20.080> one<00:01:20.409> of<00:01:20.440> these<00:01:20.619> now<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.549> the

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
had your eye on one of these now is the

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.030 
had your eye on one of these now is the
time<00:01:21.930> definitely<00:01:22.930> worth<00:01:23.320> your<00:01:23.350> while<00:01:23.710> to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
time definitely worth your while to

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.039 
time definitely worth your while to
listen<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.670> stereo<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.720> panning

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
listen to this in stereo the panning

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.050 
listen to this in stereo the panning
effect<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.560> really<00:01:27.070> cool<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> mean<00:01:27.490> it's<00:01:27.729> kind

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
effect is really cool I mean it's kind

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.480 
effect is really cool I mean it's kind
of<00:01:28.119> what<00:01:28.240> really<00:01:28.450> makes<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.960> pedal<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:29.920> that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
of what really makes this pedal so that

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420 
of what really makes this pedal so that
being<00:01:30.670> said<00:01:30.760> let's<00:01:31.270> listen<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.290> my<00:01:32.620> unaffected

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
being said let's listen to my unaffected

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.310 
being said let's listen to my unaffected
reference<00:01:33.790> with<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.030> flying<00:01:34.270> pan<00:01:34.510> off<00:01:34.750> I've

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
reference with the flying pan off I've

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.800 
reference with the flying pan off I've
got<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.620> PRS<00:01:36.160> 513<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.090> I'm<00:01:37.150> playing<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.540> through

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
got a PRS 513 and I'm playing it through

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.310 
got a PRS 513 and I'm playing it through
an<00:01:38.050> Orange<00:01:38.500> Crush<00:01:38.680> 35<00:01:39.460> RT<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.810> fender

an Orange Crush 35 RT and a fender
Princeton<00:01:41.470> Reverb<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.520> here<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:42.880> go<00:01:45.900> right

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
Princeton Reverb so here we go right

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.470 
Princeton Reverb so here we go right
that's<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> basic<00:01:47.560> clean<00:01:47.770> tone<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:49.060> I'll

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
that's the basic clean tone and now I'll

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.700 
that's the basic clean tone and now I'll
kick<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.440> panner

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.250 

and<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:59.150> controls<00:01:59.510> for<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.750> panner<00:01:59.960> are

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
and the controls for the panner are

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.890 
and the controls for the panner are
really<00:02:00.590> simple<00:02:00.980> it's<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:01.490> app<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:02.000> speed<00:02:02.330> so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
really simple it's just app and speed so

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.380 
really simple it's just app and speed so
I<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.770> turn<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.070> down<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.610> nice<00:02:04.820> big<00:02:05.030> knob<00:02:05.210> so

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
I can turn it down here nice big knob so

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:19.110 
I can turn it down here nice big knob so
I<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.570> do<00:02:05.630> with<00:02:05.750> my<00:02:05.900> foot

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.490 

so<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.239> range<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.719> pan<00:02:20.930> speed<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.349> pretty

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
so the range on the pan speed is pretty

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.020 
so the range on the pan speed is pretty
incredible<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:22.069> goes<00:02:22.159> from<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.700> slow<00:02:22.969> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
incredible it goes from really slow to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.839 
incredible it goes from really slow to
really<00:02:23.569> really<00:02:23.840> fast<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.859> it's<00:02:25.549> just<00:02:25.760> that

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
really really fast and it's just that

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.699 
really really fast and it's just that
one<00:02:26.060> knob<00:02:26.299> that's<00:02:26.689> for<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.959> panner<00:02:27.200> as<00:02:27.439> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
one knob that's for the panner as you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.080 
one knob that's for the panner as you
can<00:02:27.829> see<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.159> a<00:02:28.250> switch<00:02:28.549> for<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.849> pan<00:02:29.060> ER

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
can see there's a switch for the pan ER

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
can see there's a switch for the pan ER
and<00:02:29.359> there's<00:02:29.750> also<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.170> switch<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.799> phase

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and there's also a switch for the phase

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.830 
and there's also a switch for the phase
shifter<00:02:31.430> as<00:02:31.579> well<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.329> you<00:02:32.390> can<00:02:32.540> use<00:02:32.599> them

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
shifter as well so you can use them

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.440 
shifter as well so you can use them
independently<00:02:33.560> or<00:02:33.859> together<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.000> we're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
independently or together so now we're

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.000 
independently or together so now we're
going<00:02:35.689> to<00:02:35.840> listen<00:02:36.049> to<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.349> phase<00:02:36.650> shifter

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
going to listen to the phase shifter

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:50.830 
going to listen to the phase shifter
side<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:49.340> you've<00:02:49.549> got<00:02:49.730> three<00:02:49.939> controls<00:02:50.359> for

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
side right you've got three controls for

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.449 
side right you've got three controls for
the<00:02:51.049> phase<00:02:51.319> shifter<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.799> have<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.159> phase

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the phase shifter you have the phase

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.960 
the phase shifter you have the phase
speed<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.230> feedback<00:02:54.819> which<00:02:55.819> is

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
speed you have the feedback which is

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.670 
speed you have the feedback which is
basically<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.540> depth<00:02:56.780> control<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
basically the depth control and then you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.589 
basically the depth control and then you
have<00:02:57.829> something<00:02:58.099> called<00:02:58.129> phase<00:02:58.549> select<00:02:59.060> which

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
have something called phase select which

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.599 
have something called phase select which
is<00:02:59.810> left<00:03:00.109> stereo<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.889> right<00:03:01.069> now<00:03:01.489> the

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
is left stereo and right now the

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.550 
is left stereo and right now the
interesting<00:03:02.150> thing<00:03:02.299> about<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.019> can

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
interesting thing about that is you can

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.080 
interesting thing about that is you can
have<00:03:03.919> the<00:03:04.159> phase<00:03:04.340> shifter<00:03:04.639> running<00:03:04.909> through

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
have the phase shifter running through

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.409 
have the phase shifter running through
both<00:03:05.299> amps<00:03:05.689> or<00:03:05.780> either<00:03:06.560> amp<00:03:06.950> individually<00:03:07.669> the

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:08.419 
both amps or either amp individually the

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.640 
both amps or either amp individually the
other<00:03:08.540> thing<00:03:08.810> you'll<00:03:08.930> notice<00:03:09.139> is<00:03:09.379> that<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
other thing you'll notice is that the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.740 
other thing you'll notice is that the
phase<00:03:09.859> shifter<00:03:10.250> doesn't<00:03:10.639> actually<00:03:10.790> move<00:03:11.359> in

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
phase shifter doesn't actually move in

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.170 
phase shifter doesn't actually move in
stereo<00:03:12.230> itself<00:03:12.709> all<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.010> stereo<00:03:13.579> comes<00:03:13.849> from

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
stereo itself all the stereo comes from

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.259 
stereo itself all the stereo comes from
the<00:03:14.419> panning<00:03:15.049> effect<00:03:15.169> and<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.639> know<00:03:16.760> honestly

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the panning effect and you know honestly

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.330 
the panning effect and you know honestly
if<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.629> had<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.989> stereo<00:03:18.680> phase<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
if you had the stereo phase and the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.159 
if you had the stereo phase and the
stereo<00:03:19.700> panning<00:03:20.060> going<00:03:20.269> at<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.450> same<00:03:20.629> time<00:03:20.930> it

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
stereo panning going at the same time it

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.140 
stereo panning going at the same time it
would<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.439> pretty<00:03:21.590> wacky<00:03:21.919> so<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> this

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
would get pretty wacky so this is a this

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.000 
would get pretty wacky so this is a this
is<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.659> a<00:03:23.690> very<00:03:23.900> practical<00:03:24.229> use<00:03:24.650> of<00:03:24.859> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
is you know a very practical use of it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830 
is you know a very practical use of it
so<00:03:25.159> checking<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> phaser<00:03:26.449> a<00:03:26.569> little

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
so checking out the phaser a little

00:03:26.840 --> 00:04:14.820 
so checking out the phaser a little
closer<00:03:27.079> here<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:27.739> we<00:03:27.829> go

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.800 

right<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> lot<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.100> good<00:04:16.280> extremes<00:04:16.730> there<00:04:17.090> to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
right a lot of good extremes there to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.510 
right a lot of good extremes there to
demonstrate<00:04:18.020> how<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.530> face<00:04:18.830> selects<00:04:19.250> which

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
demonstrate how the face selects which

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.699 
demonstrate how the face selects which
works<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.060> put<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.720> over<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.050> left<00:04:21.440> channel

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
works I put it over in the left channel

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.470 
works I put it over in the left channel
only<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.370> then<00:04:22.940> I'm<00:04:23.030> going<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.180> turn<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
only and then I'm going to turn the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:44.150 
only and then I'm going to turn the
panner<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.170> off

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.230 

so<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.490> kind<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.760> adds<00:04:45.940> another

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
so that just kind of adds another

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.680 
so that just kind of adds another
dimension<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.260> wackiness<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.220> this<00:04:48.340> thing

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
dimension to the wackiness of this thing

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.390 
dimension to the wackiness of this thing
flying<00:04:49.690> pan<00:04:49.930> also<00:04:50.229> works<00:04:50.440> great<00:04:50.560> in<00:04:50.860> mono<00:04:51.100> when

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
flying pan also works great in mono when

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.350 
flying pan also works great in mono when
you<00:04:51.520> do<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:51.790> this<00:04:51.910> way

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
you do it this way

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.510 
you do it this way
the<00:04:52.510> panner<00:04:52.780> becomes<00:04:53.199> a<00:04:53.320> tremolo<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.220> I've<00:04:54.340> got

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
the panner becomes a tremolo so I've got

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.950 
the panner becomes a tremolo so I've got
it<00:04:54.610> turned<00:04:54.760> on<00:04:54.970> right<00:04:55.120> now<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.570> with<00:04:55.750> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
it turned on right now just with the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.730 
it turned on right now just with the
panner<00:04:56.350> on<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:56.830> one<00:04:57.010> side

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:09.820 

I<00:05:07.360> also<00:05:08.360> put<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.960> phase<00:05:09.169> shifter<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.680> that

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
I also put the phase shifter to that

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.770 
I also put the phase shifter to that
side<00:05:10.069> to<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.370> right<00:05:10.550> side<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:10.819> let's<00:05:11.419> click
