Crouch button quickly do a slide now I

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.129 
Crouch button quickly do a slide now I
haven't<00:03:03.609> fully<00:03:03.730> tested<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.389> out<00:03:04.629> which<00:03:04.959> is

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
haven't fully tested this out which is

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.179 
haven't fully tested this out which is
faster<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:06.189> jump<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.760> air<00:03:06.790> -<00:03:07.599> or<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.859> slide

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
faster to jump in the air - or the slide

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.309 
faster to jump in the air - or the slide
all<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.670> way<00:03:09.819> around<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.239> map<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:11.170> they're

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
all the way around the map but they're

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.530 
all the way around the map but they're
both<00:03:11.470> pretty<00:03:12.069> quick<00:03:12.400> movements<00:03:13.030> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
both pretty quick movements it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.539 
both pretty quick movements it
definitely<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.349> around<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.799> map<00:03:15.190> much

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
definitely get you around the map much

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.220 
definitely get you around the map much
quicker<00:03:15.879> so<00:03:16.629> something<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:16.989> should

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
quicker so something you should

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.650 
quicker so something you should
definitely<00:03:17.680> be<00:03:17.709> doing<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:19.419> can<00:03:19.540> always

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
definitely be doing and you can always

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.050 
definitely be doing and you can always
throw<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.079> enemy<00:03:20.349> off<00:03:20.500> by<00:03:20.799> dashing<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.669> weird

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
throw the enemy off by dashing and weird

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
kind of directions like let's say there

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.250
