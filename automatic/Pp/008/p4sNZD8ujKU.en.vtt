hey<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.469> tutorial<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:02.129> going<00:00:02.220> to

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey guys in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.579 
hey guys in this tutorial we're going to
be<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.669> over<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.030> basic<00:00:03.540> attack<00:00:03.689> system<00:00:04.140> this

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
be going over a basic attack system this

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.559 
be going over a basic attack system this
is<00:00:04.830> nothing<00:00:05.400> really<00:00:05.549> fancy<00:00:05.819> it's<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:06.390> going

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
is nothing really fancy it's just going

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.900 
is nothing really fancy it's just going
to<00:00:06.629> be<00:00:06.720> using<00:00:07.020> triggers<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:08.280> sure<00:00:08.639> there's

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
to be using triggers I'm sure there's

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.379 
to be using triggers I'm sure there's
other<00:00:09.090> ways<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.450> doing<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.900> using<00:00:11.059> Ray<00:00:12.059> casting

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
other ways of doing it using Ray casting

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
other ways of doing it using Ray casting
or<00:00:15.350> testing<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> distance<00:00:16.949> between<00:00:17.190> two

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
or testing the distance between two

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.990 
or testing the distance between two
different<00:00:18.390> objects<00:00:19.340> but<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> tutorial

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
different objects but for this tutorial

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.290 
different objects but for this tutorial
we're<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.939> simple

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
we're just going to do a very simple

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.400 
we're just going to do a very simple
attack<00:00:25.050> system<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.920> works<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.170> first

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
attack system that works so the first

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.750 
attack system that works so the first
thing<00:00:28.590> we're<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> we're<00:00:29.640> going

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.299 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:29.820> create<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.480> new<00:00:31.289> cube<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:32.009> gonna<00:00:32.099> be

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to create a new cube that we're gonna be

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
to create a new cube that we're gonna be
using<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:36.559> for<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
using and this is going to be for the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.310 
using and this is going to be for the
area<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> attack

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.930 

so<00:00:46.039> we'll<00:00:46.399> make<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:46.850> 10<00:00:48.129> 10

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so we'll make this 10 10

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.220 
so we'll make this 10 10
to<00:00:51.940> me

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.820 

now<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.100> want<00:01:01.310> to<00:01:01.400> do<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:02.350> set<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.560> up

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
now what you want to do is set this up

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.350 
now what you want to do is set this up
so<00:01:05.620> whatever<00:01:06.620> you<00:01:06.800> want<00:01:07.040> your<00:01:07.160> attack<00:01:07.460> area<00:01:07.880> to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
so whatever you want your attack area to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.050 
so whatever you want your attack area to
be

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.790 

we'll<00:01:15.570> probably<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.110> set<00:01:16.260> this<00:01:16.410> back<00:01:16.620> down

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
we'll probably just set this back down

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.260 
we'll probably just set this back down
the<00:01:16.980> time<00:01:17.190> because<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.730> want<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.090> big

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the time because we don't want that big

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.800 
the time because we don't want that big
of<00:01:18.420> an<00:01:18.480> area

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.960 

and<00:01:27.350> then<00:01:27.560> we'll<00:01:27.860> mess<00:01:28.070> with<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> stuff<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:28.820> a

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
and then we'll mess with the stuff in a

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.940 
and then we'll mess with the stuff in a
second<00:01:29.690> when<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.900> show<00:01:30.350> off<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.590> script<00:01:30.860> a

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
second when I show off the script a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.120 
second when I show off the script a
little<00:01:31.159> bit<00:01:31.869> so<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.590> script<00:01:33.830> we're

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
little bit so this is the script we're

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.780 
little bit so this is the script we're
going<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.460> throwing<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:35.240> our<00:01:35.360> enemy<00:01:36.790> first

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
going to be throwing on our enemy first

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.249 
going to be throwing on our enemy first
thing<00:01:38.030> we're<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.360> do<00:01:38.540> is<00:01:38.810> give<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
thing we're going to do is give the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.210 
thing we're going to do is give the
enemy<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:40.100> hundred<00:01:40.640> health<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.070> our

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
enemy a hundred health and then in our

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.469 
enemy a hundred health and then in our
update<00:01:43.550> function<00:01:43.580> we're<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:46.479> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
update function we're going to have to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.889 
update function we're going to have to
check<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.050> see<00:01:48.710> if<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.909> enemy<00:01:50.210> health<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.630> less

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
check to see if the enemy health is less

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.050 
check to see if the enemy health is less
than<00:01:51.110> or<00:01:51.170> equal<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.770> zero<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.100> if<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.520> is<00:01:52.640> will

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
than or equal to zero and if it is will

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.630 
than or equal to zero and if it is will
kill<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.840> enemy<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:54.560> destroy<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.250> object

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
kill the enemy just destroy the object

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.200 
kill the enemy just destroy the object
and<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:58.220> time<00:01:58.430> we're<00:01:58.610> going<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.759> be<00:01:58.910> using

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
and this time we're going to be using

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.290 
and this time we're going to be using
for<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.420> trigger<00:01:59.750> on<00:02:00.080> trigger<00:02:00.530> stick<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:02.030> if

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
for a trigger on trigger stick so if

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.749 
for a trigger on trigger stick so if
something<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.840> staying<00:02:03.170> within<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.310> trigger

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
something is staying within the trigger

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.380 
something is staying within the trigger
area<00:02:06.729> yeah<00:02:07.729> it'll<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.450> able<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.910> be

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
area yeah it'll be able to to be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.440 
area yeah it'll be able to to be
constantly<00:02:11.959> checking<00:02:12.430> if<00:02:13.430> it's<00:02:14.060> within

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
constantly checking if it's within

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.920 
constantly checking if it's within
attack<00:02:14.900> area<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.519> pretty<00:02:17.030> much<00:02:17.150> it'll<00:02:17.810> be

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
attack area so pretty much it'll be

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.979 
attack area so pretty much it'll be
checking<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.890> enemy<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.910> within<00:02:20.630> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
checking if the enemy is within the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.830 
checking if the enemy is within the
attack<00:02:21.260> area<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.250> then<00:02:23.000> here<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.450> we're<00:02:23.750> going

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
attack area and then here is we're going

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.160 
attack area and then here is we're going
to<00:02:23.930> put<00:02:24.200> our<00:02:24.610> player<00:02:25.610> attack<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
to put our player attack and if you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.210 
to put our player attack and if you
press<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.920> 1<00:02:31.280> key<00:02:31.310> it'll<00:02:31.940> deal<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:33.040> 100<00:02:34.040> damage

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
press the 1 key it'll deal a 100 damage

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.500 
press the 1 key it'll deal a 100 damage
if<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.540> enemy<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:35.930> within<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.530> area

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:50.280 

so<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.739> our<00:02:41.830> enemy<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:44.650> are<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:45.250> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.080 

put<00:02:50.620> our

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.490 

yeah<00:02:56.120> player<00:02:56.890> player<00:02:57.890> attack

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.650 

on<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.460> our<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.210> we<00:03:06.330> want<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660

on to our a I and then what we want to
do<00:03:06.960> is<00:03:08.480> actually<00:03:09.480> gonna<00:03:09.840> take<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.860> little

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
do is actually gonna take this little

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040 
do is actually gonna take this little
bit<00:03:11.580> taller

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.920 

we're<00:03:14.650> going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.040> call<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.550> trigger<00:03:16.000> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
we're going to call it is trigger and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.470 
we're going to call it is trigger and
then<00:03:17.560> firm<00:03:17.800> mesh<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.490> don't<00:03:18.670> want<00:03:19.000> this

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
then firm mesh if you don't want this

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.450 
then firm mesh if you don't want this
blocking<00:03:20.020> the<00:03:20.140> area<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.740> can<00:03:20.950> disable<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
blocking the area you can disable the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.640 
blocking the area you can disable the
mesh<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.060> it'll<00:03:22.240> speak<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:23.050> that<00:03:23.700> then<00:03:24.700> oh

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
mesh so it'll speak like that then oh

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.450 
mesh so it'll speak like that then oh
damn

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.690 

but<00:03:34.060> we<00:03:34.240> want<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.660> name<00:03:34.870> this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.979 

tech<00:03:39.300> area<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.430> we'll<00:03:41.430> find<00:03:41.730> our<00:03:41.819> player<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
tech area and we'll find our player and

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.309 
tech area and we'll find our player and
drop<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.220> onto<00:03:45.180> our<00:03:45.750> player

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.720 

and<00:03:49.709> now<00:03:50.099> we<00:03:50.640> want<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:51.000> add<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> new<00:03:51.390> text<00:03:52.730> told

and now we want to add a new text told

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.640 
and now we want to add a new text told
this<00:03:53.939> text<00:03:54.540> area

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.930 

and<00:03:58.739> go<00:03:59.489> back<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.180> our<00:04:00.480> attack<00:04:00.870> area<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:02.250> take

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
and go back to our attack area and take

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.820 
and go back to our attack area and take
it<00:04:03.090> as<00:04:03.239> attack<00:04:04.019> area

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.970 

so<00:04:10.490> we<00:04:10.670> can<00:04:10.820> see<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.300> works<00:04:11.540> real<00:04:11.750> quick

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
so we can see if this works real quick

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.600 
so we can see if this works real quick
it'll<00:04:12.980> walk<00:04:13.190> up<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.520> me<00:04:13.660> press<00:04:14.660> one<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.610> he's

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
it'll walk up to me press one and he's

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.560 
it'll walk up to me press one and he's
gone<00:04:16.959> now<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.019> can<00:04:18.200> also<00:04:18.320> set<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:18.830> up<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.570> it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
gone now you can also set this up so it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.400 
gone now you can also set this up so it
does<00:04:20.840> less<00:04:21.200> damage<00:04:21.230> and<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:23.120> can<00:04:23.270> also<00:04:23.420> turn

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
does less damage and you can also turn

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.130 
does less damage and you can also turn
the<00:04:24.740> enemy<00:04:25.160> into<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> prefab<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.450> spawn<00:04:26.900> them

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
the enemy into a prefab and spawn them

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.670 
the enemy into a prefab and spawn them
like<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.950> those<00:04:28.250> blocks<00:04:28.640> up<00:04:28.910> there<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:30.350> it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
like you do those blocks up there so it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.200 
like you do those blocks up there so it
could<00:04:30.800> spawn<00:04:31.130> an<00:04:31.310> enemy<00:04:31.640> every<00:04:31.940> couple

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
could spawn an enemy every couple

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.870 
could spawn an enemy every couple
seconds<00:04:32.600> and<00:04:32.870> if<00:04:32.990> they<00:04:33.400> get<00:04:34.400> within<00:04:34.760> that

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
seconds and if they get within that

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.350 
seconds and if they get within that
trigger<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.450> press<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.990> button<00:04:36.710> or

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
trigger and you press the button or

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.090 
trigger and you press the button or
whatever<00:04:38.360> key<00:04:38.690> em<00:04:38.810> you're<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.830> have

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
whatever key em you're that you have

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.880 
whatever key em you're that you have
bound<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.880> will<00:04:41.330> kill<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.530> enemy<00:04:42.560> and

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
bound to it it will kill the enemy and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.640 
bound to it it will kill the enemy and
destroy<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.700> from<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:43.880> game<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.390> now<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.500> can

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
destroy it from the game and now you can

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.190 
destroy it from the game and now you can
also<00:04:45.770> do<00:04:46.210> other<00:04:47.210> things<00:04:47.630> with<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:49.720> okay<00:04:50.720> so<00:04:50.990> if

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
also do other things with it okay so if

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.570 
also do other things with it okay so if
the<00:04:51.350> enemy<00:04:51.680> dies<00:04:52.960> maybe<00:04:53.960> we<00:04:54.410> want<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.040> give<00:04:55.490> our

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the enemy dies maybe we want to give our

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.680 
the enemy dies maybe we want to give our
player<00:04:55.790> some<00:04:56.030> XP<00:04:57.700> we<00:04:58.700> will<00:04:58.910> go<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.420> our

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
player some XP we will go back to our

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.420 
player some XP we will go back to our
player<00:05:00.140> health<00:05:00.440> script<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.860> we<00:05:00.980> made<00:05:01.190> in

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
player health script that we made in

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.760 
player health script that we made in
previous<00:05:01.700> tutorials<00:05:02.390> and<00:05:03.520> we<00:05:04.520> will<00:05:05.410> set<00:05:06.410> a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
previous tutorials and we will set a

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.230 
previous tutorials and we will set a
correct<00:05:07.460> Pete<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.180> static

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.879 

and<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.139> in<00:05:12.289> our<00:05:12.410> playerhealth<00:05:12.710> script

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
and that is in our playerhealth script

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.600 
and that is in our playerhealth script
so<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.759> will<00:05:14.060> go<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.440> player<00:05:15.440> attack<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:19.550> make

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
so we will go to player attack to make

experience<00:05:42.159> from<00:05:42.369> it<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:43.479> that<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.499> the<00:05:44.650> basics

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
experience from it so that is the basics

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.239 
experience from it so that is the basics
of<00:05:45.189> how<00:05:45.309> to<00:05:45.339> set<00:05:45.729> up<00:05:45.879> or<00:05:46.089> how<00:05:46.779> I<00:05:46.809> set<00:05:47.409> up<00:05:47.439> combat

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
systems I'm sure there's an easier way I

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.139 
systems I'm sure there's an easier way I
would<00:05:50.830> really<00:05:51.039> like<00:05:51.279> to<00:05:51.309> learn<00:05:51.580> if<00:05:51.849> someone

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:52.149 
would really like to learn if someone

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.299 
would really like to learn if someone
else<00:05:52.300> knows<00:05:52.899> a<00:05:52.930> more<00:05:53.409> simple<00:05:53.740> way<00:05:53.830> of<00:05:53.860> doing
