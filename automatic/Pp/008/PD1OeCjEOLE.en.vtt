the reason why you're doing this is

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.390 
the reason why you're doing this is
because<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:18.650> started<00:03:19.650> crafting<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:20.040> lot<00:03:20.190> 11

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
because I started crafting a lot 11

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.130 
because I started crafting a lot 11
everybody<00:03:20.880> said<00:03:21.120> level<00:03:21.390> 20<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.750> when<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.900> should

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
everybody said level 20 is when I should

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.170 
everybody said level 20 is when I should
start<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.890> because<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.579> run<00:03:23.700> out<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.880> credits

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
start so because you run out of credits

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.590 
start so because you run out of credits
so<00:03:24.870> what<00:03:25.170> happens<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.829> use<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:27.120> as<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.360> way

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so what happens is I use this as a way

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.490 
so what happens is I use this as a way
to<00:03:27.900> pay<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.680> my<00:03:28.920> gathering<00:03:29.579> but<00:03:30.239> also<00:03:30.500> getting

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to pay for my gathering but also getting

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440 
to pay for my gathering but also getting
it's<00:03:31.890> like<00:03:32.040> you're<00:03:32.190> doubling<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.670> because<00:03:33.030> if

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
it's like you're doubling up because if

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.240 
it's like you're doubling up because if
you're<00:03:34.019> an<00:03:34.079> artificer<00:03:34.530> an<00:03:34.590> archaeologist<00:03:35.160> you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
you're an artificer an archaeologist you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.039 
you're an artificer an archaeologist you

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
and everything so here's another leap

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:00.550 
and everything so here's another leap
rope<00:03:52.590> combat<00:03:53.250> droid<00:03:53.489> knock<00:03:54.269> him<00:03:54.480> out<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:58.340> mean

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
rope combat droid knock him out I mean

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.210 
rope combat droid knock him out I mean
he<00:04:01.560> usually<00:04:01.680> drops<00:04:02.040> green<00:04:02.340> as<00:04:02.489> well<00:04:02.670> or

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
he usually drops green as well or

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.650 
he usually drops green as well or
nothing<00:04:05.220> at<00:04:05.310> all<00:04:05.459> which<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.060> course<00:04:06.090> he<00:04:06.450> just

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
nothing at all which of course he just

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.940 
nothing at all which of course he just
did<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.200> if<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.350> look<00:04:07.470> over<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.829> left

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
did that and if you look over to left

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.050 
did that and if you look over to left
here<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.280> kill<00:04:08.459> these<00:04:08.579> droids<00:04:08.850> there's

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
here if you kill these droids there's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.280 
here if you kill these droids there's
another<00:04:09.269> crystal<00:04:09.660> over<00:04:09.840> there<00:04:09.959> which<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.170> can

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
another crystal over there which you can

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.710 
another crystal over there which you can
kill<00:04:10.760> then<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.910> work<00:04:12.090> your<00:04:12.120> way<00:04:12.299> back<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.630> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
kill then you work your way back to the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.599 
kill then you work your way back to the
starting<00:04:13.019> spot<00:04:15.560> where<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.799> credit<00:04:17.220> chest<00:04:17.400> is

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
starting spot where the credit chest is

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.840 
starting spot where the credit chest is
and<00:04:18.950> you'll<00:04:19.950> probably<00:04:20.039> weigh<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.549> two<00:04:20.729> or

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
and you'll probably weigh like two or

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.430 
and you'll probably weigh like two or
three<00:04:20.880> minutes<00:04:21.090> again<00:04:21.600> depending<00:04:22.200> on<00:04:22.320> how

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
three minutes again depending on how

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.380 
three minutes again depending on how
fast<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:23.099> kill<00:04:23.340> these<00:04:23.490> guys<00:04:23.520> whatever<00:04:24.030> but

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
fast you kill these guys whatever but

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.690 
fast you kill these guys whatever but
usually<00:04:24.750> around<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.560> know<00:04:25.849> 18<00:04:26.849> to<00:04:26.940> 29

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
usually around you know 18 to 29

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.490 
usually around you know 18 to 29
can<00:04:27.850> probably<00:04:28.840> wait<00:04:28.930> like<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.140> minute<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.440> a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
can probably wait like a minute and a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.560 
can probably wait like a minute and a
half<00:04:29.530> or<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.310> then<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.180> repeat<00:04:31.420> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
half or so and then you repeat the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.600 
half or so and then you repeat the
process<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:32.650> come<00:04:32.830> right<00:04:32.980> back<00:04:33.130> down<00:04:33.340> here

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
process you come right back down here

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.790 
process you come right back down here
and<00:04:33.640> another<00:04:33.970> good<00:04:34.210> thing<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.450> if<00:04:34.900> your

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
and another good thing is if your
