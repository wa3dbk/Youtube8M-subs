personal project it's called 1324 but I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.040 
personal project it's called 1324 but I
think<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.140> idea<00:00:44.170> behind<00:00:45.120> project<00:00:46.120> 1324

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
think the idea behind project 1324

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.110 
think the idea behind project 1324
started<00:00:47.830> with<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.040> passion<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.610> desire<00:00:48.910> to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
started with a passion and desire to

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.189 
started with a passion and desire to
take<00:00:49.480> photographs<00:00:50.080> I<00:00:50.790> needed<00:00:51.790> a<00:00:51.910> way<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.199> stay

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
take photographs I needed a way to stay

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.420 
take photographs I needed a way to stay
motivated<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.980> two<00:00:54.699> I<00:00:55.500> guess<00:00:56.500> fuel<00:00:57.400> the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
motivated and two I guess fuel the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.920 
motivated and two I guess fuel the
passion<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:57.970> was<00:00:58.210> inside<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.540> me<00:00:58.690> for

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
passion that was inside of me for

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.180 
passion that was inside of me for
photography<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.710> all<00:01:02.890> kind<00:01:03.160> of

were<00:01:30.520> coming<00:01:30.789> over<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.649> I<00:01:32.649> just<00:01:33.100> asked<00:01:33.490> my

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610

friend Jennifer to put these glasses on

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.859 
friend Jennifer to put these glasses on
and<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.190> started<00:01:37.060> taking<00:01:37.119> pictures<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.690> her<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
and I started taking pictures of her and

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.219 
and I started taking pictures of her and
I<00:01:37.990> noticed<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:40.450> she<00:01:40.660> put<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.899> glasses

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
I noticed that when she put the glasses

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.199 
I noticed that when she put the glasses
on<00:01:41.970> part<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.060> her<00:01:43.330> had<00:01:44.140> come<00:01:44.410> out<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:45.250> know<00:01:45.429> she

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
on part of her had come out you know she

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.930 
on part of her had come out you know she
does<00:01:46.390> she<00:01:47.110> normally<00:01:47.350> doesn't<00:01:47.740> like<00:01:48.069> having

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
does she normally doesn't like having

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.680 
does she normally doesn't like having
pictures<00:01:49.330> taking<00:01:49.780> over<00:01:50.020> itself<00:01:50.800> but<00:01:51.160> the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
pictures taking over itself but the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.930 
pictures taking over itself but the
glasses<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.929> guess<00:01:53.500> kind<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.830> shielded<00:01:54.310> that

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
glasses I guess kind of shielded that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.310 
glasses I guess kind of shielded that
part<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.360> her<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.780> let<00:01:56.530> her<00:01:56.560> open<00:01:56.770> up

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
part of her and let her open up

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.720 
part of her and let her open up
so<00:01:59.320> I<00:01:59.350> started<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.800> notice<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.310> whenever<00:02:00.490> I

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
so I started to notice that whenever I

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.910 
so I started to notice that whenever I
would<00:02:00.910> hand<00:02:01.180> people<00:02:01.810> these<00:02:02.050> these<00:02:02.590> glasses

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
would hand people these these glasses

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.150 
would hand people these these glasses
that<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.760> part<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.270> them<00:02:04.480> that<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.950> probably

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
that a part of them that they probably

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.730 
that a part of them that they probably
normally<00:02:06.820> would<00:02:07.000> have<00:02:07.120> kept<00:02:07.960> from<00:02:08.110> someone<00:02:08.530> or

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
normally would have kept from someone or

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.180 
normally would have kept from someone or
from<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.100> camera<00:02:09.369> from<00:02:09.759> from<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.360> lens<00:02:11.190> would

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
from a camera from from the lens would

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.570 
from a camera from from the lens would
come<00:02:12.430> out<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.870> would<00:02:14.320> initially<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.430> like

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
come out I would initially just be like

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.730 
come out I would initially just be like
hey<00:02:15.610> I'm<00:02:15.940> doing<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.240> project<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.620> take

your portrait all you have to do is is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.230

where<00:02:19.990> these<00:02:20.200> these<00:02:20.860> glasses<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.090> would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
where these these glasses then I would

that<00:02:44.050> aspect<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:45.070> project<00:02:45.310> really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
that aspect of the project really

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.970 
that aspect of the project really
excited<00:02:46.450> me<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.230> was<00:02:47.500> getting<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
excited me because I was getting a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.670 
excited me because I was getting a
glimpse<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.640> something<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.300> probably<00:02:50.110> no

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
glimpse of something that probably no

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.710 
glimpse of something that probably no
one's<00:02:50.920> ever<00:02:51.100> seen<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.700> someone<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.690> that

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
one's ever seen in someone or in that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.680 
one's ever seen in someone or in that
person<00:02:53.290> or<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.220> complete<00:02:54.580> stranger<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.290> I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
person or in a complete stranger and I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.060 
person or in a complete stranger and I
think<00:02:58.690> that's<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.290> real<00:02:59.470> passion<00:02:59.950> of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
think that's the real passion of

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.220 
think that's the real passion of
photography<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.209> tell<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> story<00:03:01.900> of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
photography is to tell a story of

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.530 
photography is to tell a story of
something<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.790> wouldn't<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.510> unless

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
something that you wouldn't see unless

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.840 
something that you wouldn't see unless
the<00:03:05.260> photographer<00:03:06.040> had<00:03:06.250> snapped<00:03:06.640> that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the photographer had snapped that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.710 
the photographer had snapped that
picture

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.540 

so<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.080> goal<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.319> project<00:03:12.950> was<00:03:15.310> went<00:03:16.310> from<00:03:16.489> a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
so the goal the project was went from a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.960 
so the goal the project was went from a
small<00:03:17.150> idea<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:18.739> photographing<00:03:19.340> my<00:03:19.459> friends

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
small idea to photographing my friends

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.229 
small idea to photographing my friends
to<00:03:20.590> pushing<00:03:21.590> out<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.550> strangers<00:03:23.000> in<00:03:23.150> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
to pushing out to the strangers in the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.210 
to pushing out to the strangers in the
street<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.959> then<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.410> have<00:03:24.590> these<00:03:24.709> ideas

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
street and then that have these ideas

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.340 
street and then that have these ideas
and<00:03:25.550> twist<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.900> add<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.319> project<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.739> I

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
and twist to add to the project and so I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.229 
and twist to add to the project and so I
really<00:03:33.350> sat<00:03:33.620> down<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.860> started<00:03:34.700> writing<00:03:34.850> down

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
really sat down and started writing down

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.390 
really sat down and started writing down
everything<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.230> was<00:03:36.470> thinking<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.130> what

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
everything that I was thinking and what

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300 
everything that I was thinking and what
I<00:03:37.430> wanted<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.850> do<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.590> trying<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.680> find<00:03:39.950> that
