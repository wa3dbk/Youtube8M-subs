00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 no no 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.679
 there are very good at all I am fury and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.990
 you are watching on the screen but touch is 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.560
 a bunch of weapons and weird gossip all 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.539
 this is let's say special weapons weapons 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.699
 everything that has leaked and we have 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.860
 could see through which wikileaks os 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.739
 I leave the link to the description or in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.050
 the cinematic intro in the trailers all 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.059
 what weapons and things that have 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.129
 confirmed until the day before 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.100
 the departure from the origins map that will come out 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.570
 tomorrow I have a lot of desire to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.540
 can play it and bring you a lot of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.220
 videos so let's start with the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.290
 compiled everything in a video all that 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.989
 we have seen to this day we are going to 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.390
 start at the top the left are you 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.579
 seeing a gun the mauser pistol is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.130
 from several days ago ago 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.829
 weeks they even taught us a first 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.980
 sketch of this weapon the mauser pistol 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.840
 that will replace the main weapon to the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.909
 pistol of principle we will use this 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.009
 gun to see how it goes and once 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 improved if you can improve to see what 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.000
 how it works not because in the sketch 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.350
 it came out with a telescopic sight and a 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.960
 coupling the barrel to see how this goes 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.210
 Mauser the right then leaves the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.130
 tool a new admit I do not know if it is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.230
 exactly the omni warmi tool 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.720
 but in the cinematic we saw 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.930
 who was well and had a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 revolver shooting and if it was not even warm 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.920
 and it was a very similar revolver that's why 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 I have brought you this image of this 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.180
 revolver then sees grenades and the one below 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.510
 Mauser submachine we see the FGM 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.330
 0815 I think it's called a machine 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.580
 egÃºn as lang lang called them to see 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.060
 what is it called in the game 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.760
 this submachine gun is very vast in the video 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.830
 of the analysis the suit I put a link to 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.680
 this weapon in reality is a very weapon 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.600
 touches very large and especially the ammunition 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.340
 that brings has a huge bullets and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.530
 ready to kill the zombies I think I 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
 that will go wonderfully then to the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.010
 right we have already seen an object equip 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.960
 bleu build him a shield just like 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.870
 in buried for example namen bourget 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.670
 font edit a shield to see and see how 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 will see the location of the pieces to 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.810
 see how this is mounted on this shield 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.150
 the other had not yet seen it 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.080
 I bring there you have the image then to the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.640
 right of the shield we see the mp 40 mm 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.440
 This weapon has already been tested by me from the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 previous call of duty from the water 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.380
 war and below we see the four canes 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.630
 elementary four scepters which is what 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.390
 suit also on the trophy list of 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.030
 previous video we see that the four 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.670
 sticks let's say they are exactly the same what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.530
 only that they change is the stone and the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.350
 color of the stone are not four stones 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.410
 distinct and everything around him this 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.030
 iron aparatejo is also different 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.370
 this what we have until the day 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.280
 today here now as each one pulls out 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.710
 your own conclusions your theories and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.050
 I'll try them tomorrow to see what 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.240
 such van can be that one pull rays 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.640
 another wind shot another has fire 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.740
 go you know but they have a pint 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.230
 very cool I really want to 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.880
 try it and then on the right side in 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.520
 top to bottom column 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.010
 we see the shotgun or clean the remington 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.630
 these weapons and you have already played a call of 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.640
 duty black ops 2 zombies on maps 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 earlier these weapons come out like 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:44.670
 that the m-14 and then in the in a video 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.580
 they showed us the ballista but if the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.080
 telescopic peephole we came out with the 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.440
 iron peephole and just below is the 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.080
 steg 44 for those who do not know it is a 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.000
 with a gun that also came out in call of 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.370
 duty world at war and has also approved 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.040
 also in custom apps and so on 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.040
 last below the whole is the root 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.430
 marc 2 that for those who have the dlc 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.150
 previous the revenge dlc as the one 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.030
 it came out that included the map of buried and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.370
 included this this new weapon 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.400
 well that has been all a bit a sight 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.530
 prior to all weapons and objects that 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.169
 we can build special weapons like 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.639
 the sticks the shield that still does not 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:37.090
 had taught the m &amp; g 08 that is the 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.120
 new submachine gun the mp 40 and the 744 that 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.060
 are call of duty old call of 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.280
 duty 4 war for example and the good the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.889
 fragmentation grenade I do not know if there will be 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.380
 you feel or have not yet seen us and 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.330
 surely all this is what has 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.300
 left for the moment confirming then 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.980
 there will be many other new weapons 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.470
 tomorrow the map is already tomorrow 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.690
 you will have here helmet porros videos 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.910
 videos in piles do not be anything 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.980
 I will teach everything you see from the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.990
 first game you make until the last 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.930

 from the origins what the first 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.380
 impressions or whatever you see of the 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.900
 map objects that can be built 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.970
 location of the pieces for 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.960
 build the canes how to get the 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.530

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.780
 terek et cetera et cetera et cetera 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.729
 I've always been doing with maps 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.770
 previous and since it is the last map 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.410

 I know the giants the zombies these with 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.400
 armor has an incredible look so 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.650

 You can see and enjoy the map for the 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.849
 that you can not play and you want to see 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.280
 gameplays because here you will have it in this 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.419
