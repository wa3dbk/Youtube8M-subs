00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
do and what not to do but when it comes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.270 
do and what not to do but when it comes
to<00:02:18.140> men<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.560> better<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:20.070> be

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
to men it's just better to just be

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.330 
to men it's just better to just be
yourself<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:23.640> know<00:02:24.150> certain<00:02:25.340> protocol

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
yourself and just know certain protocol

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.060 
yourself and just know certain protocol
rules<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> game<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:29.780> dating<00:02:31.070> which

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
rules of the game of dating which

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.700 
rules of the game of dating which
shouldn't<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.850> game<00:02:33.150> but

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.190 

I<00:02:35.770> guess<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.850> call<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.300> whole<00:02:37.570> dynamic

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
I guess you can call this whole dynamic

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.190 
I guess you can call this whole dynamic
what<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.370> with<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.630> man<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
what is going on with you and the man a

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.600 
what is going on with you and the man a
bit<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:43.470> again<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.190> know<00:02:45.280> even<00:02:45.430> though

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
bit of again it you know even though

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.230 
bit of again it you know even though
it's<00:02:45.760> not<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.320> use<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:47.980> desire<00:02:48.520> that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
it's not but you use that desire that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.510 
it's not but you use that desire that
you<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.610> him<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.690> he<00:02:53.350> has<00:02:53.710> for<00:02:54.340> you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
you have for him and that he has for you

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.920 
you have for him and that he has for you
and<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:56.500> create<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.070> push<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.640> pull<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.510> stir
