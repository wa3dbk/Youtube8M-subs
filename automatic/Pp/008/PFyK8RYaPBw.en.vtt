power of ZBrush has erased a lot of the
technical<00:00:54.550> problems<00:00:55.550> that<00:00:55.970> a<00:00:56.000> lot<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.329> art

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
technical problems that a lot of the art

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.870 
technical problems that a lot of the art
of<00:00:56.510> artists<00:00:56.899> faced<00:00:57.110> before<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:58.550> really

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
of artists faced before it's really

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.000 
of artists faced before it's really
going<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.090> change<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.540> industry<00:00:59.750> because<00:01:00.290> now

what<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.210> can<00:01:08.359> dream<00:01:12.700> ZBrush<00:01:13.700> makes<00:01:14.149> it<00:01:14.270> fun

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
what you can dream ZBrush makes it fun

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.270 
what you can dream ZBrush makes it fun
to<00:01:14.780> sculpt<00:01:15.170> digitally<00:01:15.679> it<00:01:15.950> makes<00:01:16.159> it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
to sculpt digitally it makes it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.800 
to sculpt digitally it makes it
interesting<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.880> kind<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.179> pushes<00:01:17.450> you

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
interesting it kind of pushes you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.469 
interesting it kind of pushes you
because<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:19.039> you<00:01:19.459> know<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.939> allows<00:01:20.209> you<00:01:20.389> to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
because you you know it allows you to

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.719 
because you you know it allows you to
try<00:01:20.749> so<00:01:21.139> many<00:01:21.350> different<00:01:21.649> things<00:01:21.889> in<00:01:22.520> such<00:01:22.700> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
try so many different things in such a

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.029 
try so many different things in such a
short<00:01:22.999> period<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.479> time<00:01:23.539> that<00:01:24.049> it'll<00:01:24.859> just

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
short period of time that it'll just

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:32.990 
short period of time that it'll just
open<00:01:25.369> up<00:01:25.459> so<00:01:25.729> many<00:01:25.789> different<00:01:26.299> possibilities

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.090 

my<00:01:34.000> digital<00:01:34.600> art<00:01:34.750> piece<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.289> apple<00:01:35.740> was

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
my digital art piece the apple was

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.160 
my digital art piece the apple was
created<00:01:36.549> almost<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.000> hundred<00:01:37.090> percent<00:01:37.359> just

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
created almost a hundred percent just

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.730 
created almost a hundred percent just
using<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.649> primitives<00:01:39.130> inside<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.640> ZBrush

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
using the primitives inside of ZBrush

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.590 
using the primitives inside of ZBrush
zbrush<00:01:41.740> allows<00:01:42.039> you<00:01:42.219> to<00:01:42.460> take<00:01:42.820> primitives

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
zbrush allows you to take primitives

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.550 
zbrush allows you to take primitives
such<00:01:43.689> as<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:43.990> sphere<00:01:44.229> or<00:01:44.759> cube<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:46.560> insert

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
such as a sphere or cube and insert

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.830 
such as a sphere or cube and insert
amazing<00:01:48.369> amount<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.850> details<00:01:49.240> while<00:01:49.569> still

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
amazing amount of details while still

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.490 
amazing amount of details while still
remaining<00:01:50.289> its<00:01:50.619> primitive<00:01:51.100> status<00:01:55.500> people

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
remaining its primitive status people

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.199 
remaining its primitive status people
that<00:01:56.709> have<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.459> know<00:01:57.520> train<00:01:57.880> their<00:01:58.060> whole

that have you know train their whole
lives<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.750> focused<00:01:59.170> on<00:01:59.350> sculpting<00:01:59.799> and

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
focused on painting models things like

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.770 
focused on painting models things like
that<00:02:02.829> they<00:02:03.069> can<00:02:03.219> jump<00:02:03.520> in<00:02:03.729> ZBrush<00:02:04.390> quite

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
that they can jump in ZBrush quite

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.870 
that they can jump in ZBrush quite
easily<00:02:04.989> and<00:02:05.439> fill<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.829> home<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.399> fact<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.819> think

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
easily and fill a home in fact I think

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.150 
easily and fill a home in fact I think
they'll<00:02:07.149> feel<00:02:07.420> empowered<00:02:07.840> they<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.739> do<00:02:08.860> much

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
they'll feel empowered they can do much

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.009 
they'll feel empowered they can do much
more<00:02:09.190> than<00:02:09.489> they<00:02:09.789> can<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.269> real<00:02:10.450> world<00:02:10.660> in

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
more than they can in the real world in
