right here
and<00:01:30.690> that's<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.800> right<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and that's going to go right on the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:45.230 
and that's going to go right on the
inside<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:36.840> yellow<00:01:37.380> eagle

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.590 

she's<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> inner<00:01:47.450> bring<00:01:48.450> it

to<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> inner<00:01:48.840> half<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.680> guess

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.810 

this<00:01:59.140> shade

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
this shade

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.420 
this shade
it's<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.420> dark<00:02:01.810> dark<00:02:02.050> brown<00:02:02.290> but<00:02:02.620> it<00:02:02.710> has<00:02:02.860> little

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
it's a dark dark brown but it has little

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:17.760 
it's a dark dark brown but it has little
tiny<00:02:03.700> flecks<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.210> gold<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.660> it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.500 

with<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.310> can<00:02:19.460> kind<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.790> take<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.150> up<00:02:20.300> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
with this you can kind of take it up a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.059 
with this you can kind of take it up a
little<00:02:20.630> bit

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
little bit

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:32.730 
little bit
to<00:02:22.640> soften<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.180> edges<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:26.209> one

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:54.020 

so<00:02:33.310> that's<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.820> crease

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.150
