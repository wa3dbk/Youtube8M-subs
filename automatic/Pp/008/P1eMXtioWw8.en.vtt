00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:04.740
 in this turrialba as it demonstrates how 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 to detect computers automatically 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:14.229
 I also heard how to register these computers in the name of married or precise 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.669
 So we carry it, we're here in the air. 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.669
 on the main screen is appreciated only 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.529
 two computers 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.869
 this benefit that kim and the sites of networks 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.310
 no meeting de rieti 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 we have seven computers the next year and here it is not showing up all 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.440
 they 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.490
 so let's come here in actions 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.000
 and we will detect the computers by clicking on the detect button 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.810
 let's wait a few seconds for you to 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 computers to be added to the main screen 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.570
 already detected 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 all computers 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.460
 3 6 7 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.010
 he has already identified and added computers to the screen 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.970
 main 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.630
 now let's suppose 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 who has a computer that has fallen into another working group for how to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.730
 or it was not detected that we can register 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.830
 So let's go against Doris. 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.380
 let's click the new button 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.560
 Let's put the name of the pc 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.980
 s 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.490
 10 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.070
 his li 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 developers 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 point on day 8 point zero points 34 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.810
 or your name 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.680
 really is correct with windows and click detected I have 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 it will already fill automatically 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.070
 the tite field now your name has gone wrong 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 it will goes blank 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.170
 that is, I was able to detect Haiti 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 because I'm not wrong then 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.610
 as in my uncle it's important 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.300
 let's put ip direct 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.230
 the mac address is used to power the computer so if the remote motherboard 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.440
 on the computer in question tite com 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.300
 the very option with swimming 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 connected ships we can set the sock that we can connect from here 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.979
 counter 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.459
 so save 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.629
 it will be noted that in the list of venues 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.950
 here on the server here on the main screen I still have not lost because we have to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.739
 put it in the room 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.709
 that is 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.189
 pressure the lines that appears on the left side then give me touched pc 10 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.739
 add 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.189
 already appears here 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.549
 save them 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.549
 then computer pc leaves appear on the main screen 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.379
 heiss that way you can 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.779
 detect the counters automatically or register them morally using 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.709
 these two buttons computers culture room
