00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
project I'm going to be working on next

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.759 
project I'm going to be working on next
spring<00:00:08.670> or<00:00:08.849> next<00:00:09.090> summer<00:00:09.269> sometime<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.050> was

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
spring or next summer sometime I was

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.320 
spring or next summer sometime I was
planning<00:00:11.130> working<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.730> summer<00:00:12.030> but

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
planning working on it this summer but

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.470 
planning working on it this summer but
they<00:00:13.019> didn't<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.290> around<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.120> an

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
they didn't get around to it this is an

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.410 
they didn't get around to it this is an
old<00:00:15.660> Briggs<00:00:16.260> engine<00:00:16.710> ahead<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.340> think<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
old Briggs engine ahead I think it's a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.870 
old Briggs engine ahead I think it's a
three<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> half<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.650> five<00:00:19.949> maybe<00:00:20.460> four<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
three and a half or five maybe four I

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179 
three and a half or five maybe four I
don't<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.080> model<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.619> three<00:00:22.980> that's

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
don't know it's a model one three that's

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.580 
don't know it's a model one three that's
the<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:23.609> two<00:00:23.789> digits<00:00:24.140> that's<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.380> says

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the first two digits that's what it says

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.359 
the first two digits that's what it says
on<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.920> connecting<00:00:26.699> rod<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:29.160> probably

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
on the connecting rod and you probably

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.740 
on the connecting rod and you probably
said<00:00:29.640> we'll<00:00:29.910> look<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> number<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
said we'll look at the number on the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.840 
said we'll look at the number on the
flywheel<00:00:31.099> well<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> right

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
flywheel well that's not the right

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.350 
flywheel well that's not the right
flywheel<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.820> I'm<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.180> guessing

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
flywheel for it so I'm kind of guessing

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
flywheel for it so I'm kind of guessing
at<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:37.550> but<00:00:38.550> anyway<00:00:39.500> that<00:00:40.500> fly<00:00:40.710> builds<00:00:41.040> off<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
at it but anyway that fly builds off the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
at it but anyway that fly builds off the
five<00:00:41.489> horse<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.730> modification<00:00:44.730> I'm

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
five horse the first modification I'm

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
five horse the first modification I'm
gonna<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.510> doing<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.870> cutting<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.670> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
gonna be doing is cutting in this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.260 
gonna be doing is cutting in this
crankshaft<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> stock<00:00:51.000> one

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
crankshaft here this is the stock one

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.439 
crankshaft here this is the stock one
you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:53.510> it's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.730> place<00:00:56.730> been<00:00:57.000> hit<00:00:57.300> or

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you can see it's a place been hit or

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.189 
you can see it's a place been hit or
some<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> load<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.789> it's<00:00:59.789> been<00:00:59.969> hit<00:01:00.300> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
some kind of load on it's been hit it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.920 
some kind of load on it's been hit it's
probably<00:01:01.590> bent<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.570> it's<00:01:03.570> scored<00:01:04.019> real<00:01:04.229> bad

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
probably bent and it's scored real bad

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.789 
probably bent and it's scored real bad
see<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.500> could

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
see there this one I got here I could

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.300 
see there this one I got here I could
probably<00:01:10.890> clean<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
probably clean it up to pretty good it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
probably clean it up to pretty good it's
it<00:01:14.310> looks<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.790> good<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.689> connecting

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it looks pretty good and the connecting

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.359 
it looks pretty good and the connecting
rod<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.270> scored<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.840> bad

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
rod out of this it's scored really bad

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
rod out of this it's scored really bad
like<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.549> run<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.880> no<00:01:21.060> oil<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.630> point

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
like it's run with no oil at one point

like it's run with no oil at one point
and<00:01:23.960> there's<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> end<00:01:25.350> cap<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:27.650> little

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and there's the end cap of it little

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.330 
and there's the end cap of it little
slinger<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:33.380> that's<00:01:34.380> another<00:01:34.619> problem<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> got

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you put a new oil sealing of course this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.589 
you put a new oil sealing of course this
is<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> block

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.180 

definitely<00:02:12.599> needs<00:02:12.840> bored<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.980> is

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
definitely needs bored out this is

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.370 
definitely needs bored out this is
aluminum<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.930> I'm<00:02:16.020> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.319> try<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:19.349> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
aluminum so I'm going to try and have a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.620 
aluminum so I'm going to try and have a
machine<00:02:19.800> shop<00:02:20.069> press<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.700> cast<00:02:20.970> iron<00:02:21.239> sleeve

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
machine shop press the cast iron sleeve

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.470 
machine shop press the cast iron sleeve
in<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.970> course<00:02:24.239> I'll<00:02:24.390> be

in it if they can of course I'll be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.380 
in it if they can of course I'll be
getting<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> new<00:02:24.930> piston<00:02:25.610> new<00:02:26.610> rings<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.330> a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
getting the new piston new rings and a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.080 
getting the new piston new rings and a
new<00:02:27.569> rod<00:02:27.890> I'll<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.040> using<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.459> crankshaft

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
new rod I'll be using this crankshaft

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.050 
new rod I'll be using this crankshaft
soo<00:02:31.190> which<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.340> why<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.519> meant<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> talk<00:02:32.940> about

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
soo which is why I meant to talk about

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.979 
soo which is why I meant to talk about
earlier<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> look<00:02:34.530> they're<00:02:35.040> different

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
earlier if you look they're different

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.229 
earlier if you look they're different
this<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:37.680> shorter<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:39.060> is

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
this one is a little bit shorter this is

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.039 
this one is a little bit shorter this is
a<00:02:39.269> little<00:02:39.510> bit<00:02:39.630> longer<00:02:39.840> stroke<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.880> here<00:02:42.569> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
a little bit longer stroke and here the

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.680 
a little bit longer stroke and here the
piston<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> hard<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.790> will<00:02:45.420> come<00:02:45.569> up

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
piston kind of hard to see will come up

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.210 
piston kind of hard to see will come up
to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> top<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.260> my<00:02:46.380> fingernail<00:02:46.860> probably

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
to the top of my fingernail probably

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.610 
to the top of my fingernail probably
right<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.489> be<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.930> TDC<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.230> top<00:02:49.440> dead

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
right there be the TDC the top dead

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.190 
right there be the TDC the top dead
center<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.299> other<00:02:51.450> crankshaft<00:02:52.080> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
center and with the other crankshaft it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.300 
center and with the other crankshaft it
brings<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.530> up<00:02:52.620> level<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> deck<00:02:54.080> so

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
brings it up level with the deck so

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.670 
brings it up level with the deck so
maybe<00:02:56.630> getting<00:02:57.630> some<00:02:57.780> more<00:02:57.900> compression<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
maybe getting some more compression and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.080 
maybe getting some more compression and
maybe<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.190> little<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.459> more<00:02:59.640> power<00:02:59.849> how

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
maybe a little bit more power how

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.339 
maybe a little bit more power how
they're<00:03:00.239> doing<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:03.810> what<00:03:04.019> makes<00:03:04.200> me

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
they're doing that that's what makes me

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.949 
they're doing that that's what makes me
think<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.010> three<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.400> half<00:03:05.549> block

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
think this is a three and a half block

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.570 
think this is a three and a half block
because<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.140> one<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.470> know<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.830> crankshaft

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
because this one I know this crankshaft

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.390 
because this one I know this crankshaft
came<00:03:08.790> out<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.090> 5-horse<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:11.250> what

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
came out of a 5-horse here that's what

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.740 
came out of a 5-horse here that's what
makes<00:03:11.580> me<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.000> might<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> three<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
makes me think it might be a three and a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.569 
makes me think it might be a three and a
half<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.200> don't<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.470> maybe<00:03:14.010> y'all<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.370> help

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
half I don't know maybe y'all can help

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.979 
half I don't know maybe y'all can help
me<00:03:14.670> out<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.850> little<00:03:15.000> bit<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:18.510> valves<00:03:18.870> are

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
me out a little bit there the valves are

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.069 
me out a little bit there the valves are
good<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.070> we<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.609> grind<00:03:20.880> them<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.299> re<00:03:21.570> put

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
good so we just grind them in re put

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.160 
good so we just grind them in re put
them<00:03:22.230> back<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:23.359> retainers<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:25.109> valve<00:03:25.320> tappets

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
them back in retainers the valve tappets

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.120 
them back in retainers the valve tappets
just<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.290> little<00:03:28.500> bit<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.650> where<00:03:28.829> they're<00:03:29.010> not

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
just a little bit of where they're not

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.490 
just a little bit of where they're not
too<00:03:29.340> bad<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.209> camshafts<00:03:30.780> good<00:03:31.049> it's<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.410> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
too bad the camshafts good it's just a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.819 
too bad the camshafts good it's just a
little<00:03:31.620> rusty<00:03:32.959> there'd<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.109> no<00:03:34.260> problem

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
little rusty there'd be no problem

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.780 
little rusty there'd be no problem
flywheel<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:36.660> fine<00:03:37.370> probably<00:03:38.370> get<00:03:38.609> a<00:03:38.640> new

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
flywheel it's fine probably get a new

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660 
flywheel it's fine probably get a new
starter<00:03:39.150> clutch<00:03:39.420> having<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> little<00:03:40.670> making

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
starter clutch having a little making

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.640 
starter clutch having a little making
new<00:03:41.790> bearings<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.600> mean<00:03:42.750> not<00:03:42.900> new<00:03:43.049> bearings<00:03:43.470> but

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
new bearings I mean not new bearings but

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.629 
new bearings I mean not new bearings but
just<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.459> little<00:03:44.549> sticky<00:03:44.940> might<00:03:45.780> belt<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.139> all

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
just a little sticky might belt it all

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.640 
just a little sticky might belt it all
the<00:03:47.639> calls<00:03:47.940> good<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.900> has<00:03:49.079> points<00:03:49.500> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
the calls good it has points and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.710 
the calls good it has points and
condenser<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.310> might<00:03:51.090> end<00:03:51.239> up<00:03:51.389> getting<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
condenser I might end up getting the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.160 
condenser I might end up getting the
magnetron<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.739> don't<00:03:52.799> know<00:03:53.040> yeah<00:03:53.280> I

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
magnetron for it I don't know yeah I

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.690 
magnetron for it I don't know yeah I
just<00:03:55.170> got<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> head<00:03:55.590> gasket<00:03:56.010> laying<00:03:56.190> out<00:03:56.400> here

be getting the new one cuz it ain't no
good<00:04:02.329> this<00:04:03.329> is<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> original<00:04:03.720> head<00:04:04.170> off<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.620> it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
good this is the original head off of it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.620 
good this is the original head off of it
it's<00:04:05.970> all<00:04:06.180> clean<00:04:07.519> I'm<00:04:08.519> pretty<00:04:08.970> sure<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.389> good

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
it's all clean I'm pretty sure it's good

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.259 
it's all clean I'm pretty sure it's good
I<00:04:09.660> don't<00:04:09.870> know<00:04:10.019> if<00:04:10.139> it's<00:04:10.260> work<00:04:10.470> or<00:04:10.680> not<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:11.269> I

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
I don't know if it's work or not but I

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.500 
I don't know if it's work or not but I
have<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:13.079> one<00:04:13.940> this<00:04:14.940> one<00:04:15.120> ain't<00:04:15.359> been

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
have this one this one ain't been

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.050 
have this one this one ain't been
cleaned<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.260> might<00:04:16.620> use<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:17.310> don't<00:04:17.579> know<00:04:17.700> I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
cleaned up I might use it I don't know I

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.270 
cleaned up I might use it I don't know I
think<00:04:18.630> there's<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.140> both<00:04:19.709> exactly<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.310> same

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
think there's but both exactly the same

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.960 
think there's but both exactly the same
I<00:04:22.450> got<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.630> choose<00:04:23.960> from<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.670> it's<00:04:25.670> all<00:04:25.850> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
I got to choose from so it's all the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.300 
I got to choose from so it's all the
head<00:04:26.150> boats

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
head boats

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.130 
head boats
it's<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.400> few<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:28.850> crankcase<00:04:29.420> bolts<00:04:29.960> back

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
it's a few the crankcase bolts back

a<00:05:28.100> little<00:05:28.340> project<00:05:28.790> man<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.090> might<00:05:29.390> be<00:05:29.480> working

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
a little project man I might be working

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.320 
a little project man I might be working
on<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.400> thought<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.580> is<00:05:31.640> pretty<00:05:31.880> neat<00:05:32.120> that

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
on I thought that is pretty neat that

on I thought that is pretty neat that
the<00:05:33.190> this<00:05:34.270> my<00:05:35.270> fellas<00:05:35.570> make<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.720> structure<00:05:36.169> out

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
the this my fellas make a structure out

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.870 
the this my fellas make a structure out
of<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.620> since<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:36.860> had<00:05:37.010> this<00:05:37.130> old<00:05:37.310> crankshaft

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
of it since I had this old crankshaft

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.420 
of it since I had this old crankshaft
laying<00:05:38.150> around<00:05:38.590> it's<00:05:39.590> in<00:05:39.740> better<00:05:39.919> condition

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
laying around it's in better condition

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.560 
laying around it's in better condition
than<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:40.729> one<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.380> that<00:05:43.090> should<00:05:44.090> be<00:05:44.210> pretty

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
than that one and that should be pretty

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.090 
than that one and that should be pretty
interesting<00:05:45.110> see<00:05:45.290> how<00:05:45.380> much<00:05:45.500> power<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:45.919> does

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
interesting see how much power it does

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.520 
interesting see how much power it does
that<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:47.450> once<00:05:47.720> they<00:05:47.810> get<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.080> built<00:05:48.260> I'll

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
that and once they get it built I'll

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.890 
that and once they get it built I'll
probably<00:05:48.770> either<00:05:49.250> put<00:05:49.460> it<00:05:49.580> on<00:05:49.729> a<00:05:49.760> go-kart<00:05:50.720> or<00:05:50.840> a

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
probably either put it on a go-kart or a

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.400 
probably either put it on a go-kart or a
minibike<00:05:51.440> or<00:05:52.030> something<00:05:53.030> like<00:05:53.120> that

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
minibike or something like that

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.920 
minibike or something like that
sometimes<00:05:54.410> a<00:05:54.440> little<00:05:54.500> bit<00:05:54.680> of<00:05:54.770> fun<00:05:54.979> or<00:05:55.930> all
