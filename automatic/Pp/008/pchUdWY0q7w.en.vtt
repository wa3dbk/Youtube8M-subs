Thanksgiving is coming up this week so I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
Thanksgiving is coming up this week so I
thought<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.719> would<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.289> tutorial<00:00:16.500> inspired

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
thought I would do a tutorial inspired
by<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.970> really<00:00:18.449> wanted<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.170> last

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
started YouTube and I think I even

couldn't even like differentiate between
all<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> different<00:00:35.340> colors<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:35.940> was<00:00:36.090> using<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

all the different colors i was using so
i<00:00:36.840> don't<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> actually<00:00:37.680> made<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.129> way

to<00:00:38.370> youtube<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:38.969> i<00:00:39.420> thought<00:00:39.719> i'd<00:00:39.870> try<00:00:40.020> again

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to youtube but i thought i'd try again

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
to youtube but i thought i'd try again
this<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> tutorial<00:00:41.570> using<00:00:42.570> all

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this here and do a tutorial using all

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.209 
this here and do a tutorial using all
the<00:00:42.899> colors<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> when<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.129> think

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the colors that I think of when I think

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
the colors that I think of when I think
of<00:00:44.489> Thanksgiving<00:00:44.850> an<00:00:45.270> autumn<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> leaves

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
of Thanksgiving an autumn and the leaves

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
of Thanksgiving an autumn and the leaves
changing<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> everything<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
changing and everything like that so I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.260 
changing and everything like that so I
did<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> look<00:00:49.350> using<00:00:49.860> birkin<00:00:50.340> days<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> oranges

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
did a look using birkin days and oranges

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.410 
did a look using birkin days and oranges
golds<00:00:51.960> greens<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.949> browns<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
golds greens and browns so a lot of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
golds greens and browns so a lot of
different<00:00:54.809> colors<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.800> look

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
different colors going on in this look

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
different colors going on in this look
but<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> still<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.480> wearable<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
but I still think it's wearable for

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
but I still think it's wearable for
Thanksgiving<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> colors<00:00:59.280> aren't

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Thanksgiving because the colors aren't

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
Thanksgiving because the colors aren't
super<00:00:59.820> bright<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.300> didn't<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
super bright I didn't want to use like a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.959 
super bright I didn't want to use like a
bright<00:01:01.770> yellow<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.219> bright<00:01:02.460> orange<00:01:02.850> or

bright yellow or bright orange or
anything<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.629> wanted<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.199> keep<00:01:04.320> them

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

whether<00:06:44.229> to<00:06:44.319> do<00:06:44.560> a<00:06:44.590> nude<00:06:44.919> or<00:06:45.400> to<00:06:45.969> do<00:06:46.090> a<00:06:46.120> berry<00:06:46.479> I

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
whether to do a nude or to do a berry I

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.480 
whether to do a nude or to do a berry I
thought<00:06:46.900> might<00:06:47.110> compete<00:06:47.650> with<00:06:47.830> the<00:06:47.979> burgundy

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
thought might compete with the burgundy

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.879 
thought might compete with the burgundy
eyeshadow<00:06:48.669> too<00:06:49.180> much<00:06:49.439> and<00:06:50.439> then<00:06:50.560> I<00:06:50.590> found<00:06:50.800> this

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
eyeshadow too much and then I found this

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.350 
eyeshadow too much and then I found this
lipstick<00:06:51.370> that<00:06:51.430> I<00:06:51.610> had<00:06:51.819> completely<00:06:52.030> forgotten

last year around this time so I don't
know<00:06:57.099> how<00:06:57.280> I<00:06:57.310> forgot<00:06:57.699> about<00:06:57.909> it<00:06:57.990> but<00:06:58.990> it's<00:06:59.169> from

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
know how I forgot about it but it's from

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.580 
know how I forgot about it but it's from
nicks<00:06:59.560> and<00:06:59.800> it's<00:07:00.069> called<00:07:00.340> pumpkin<00:07:00.729> pie<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.590> it

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
nicks and it's called pumpkin pie and it

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.670 
nicks and it's called pumpkin pie and it
is<00:07:02.979> a<00:07:03.340> nude<00:07:03.789> with<00:07:04.210> more<00:07:04.569> of<00:07:04.689> like<00:07:04.870> a<00:07:05.080> peachy

is a nude with more of like a peachy

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.939 
is a nude with more of like a peachy
orangish<00:07:06.610> undertone<00:07:07.180> to<00:07:07.210> it<00:07:07.419> um<00:07:07.780> so<00:07:08.560> I<00:07:08.590> thought

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
orangish undertone to it um so I thought

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.409 
orangish undertone to it um so I thought
that<00:07:09.009> I<00:07:09.159> would<00:07:09.340> use<00:07:09.490> it<00:07:09.669> because<00:07:09.819> it's<00:07:10.180> called

that I would use it because it's called
pumpkin<00:07:10.779> pie<00:07:11.020> so<00:07:11.979> I<00:07:12.039> thought<00:07:12.219> that<00:07:12.430> it<00:07:12.520> was

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
pumpkin pie so I thought that it was

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.969 
pumpkin pie so I thought that it was
very<00:07:13.270> appropriate<00:07:13.569> for<00:07:13.930> a<00:07:14.169> Thanksgiving
