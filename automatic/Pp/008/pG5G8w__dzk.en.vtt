line up the ball with the racket and get
into<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.649> rhythm<00:00:48.800> if<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.670> learn<00:00:50.180> techniques

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
into the rhythm if you learn techniques

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.779 
into the rhythm if you learn techniques
and<00:00:50.960> grips<00:00:51.110> too<00:00:51.320> early<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.430> game

and grips too early the game

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.119 
and grips too early the game
get<00:00:53.420> quite<00:00:53.809> complicated<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.679> can<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.980> get

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
get quite complicated you can you get

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.430 
get quite complicated you can you get
lost<00:00:55.879> in<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:56.210> techniques<00:00:56.629> rather<00:00:57.230> than

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
lost in the techniques rather than

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.790 
lost in the techniques rather than
learning<00:00:57.680> how<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:57.920> just<00:00:58.519> get<00:00:58.699> into<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.969> rhythm

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
learning how to just get into the rhythm

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.590 
learning how to just get into the rhythm
all<00:00:59.950> right<00:01:00.070> and<00:01:00.160> other<00:01:00.310> part<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:00.790> once<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:01.450> got

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
all right and other part is once you got

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.910 
all right and other part is once you got
those<00:01:01.720> grips<00:01:01.990> down<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.740> feel

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
people it's not something that just

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.920 
people it's not something that just
feels<00:01:17.470> very<00:01:17.920> very<00:01:18.160> easy<00:01:18.550> but<00:01:19.270> nonetheless

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
feels very very easy but nonetheless

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.570 
feels very very easy but nonetheless
even<00:01:20.470> though<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:20.830> have<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.250> stressful

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
relaxed because if you don't relax

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.510 
relaxed because if you don't relax
