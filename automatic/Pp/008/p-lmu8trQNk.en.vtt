00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.070
 if you do not have the patience 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.320
 repeat the movement will always be 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.240
 cruel economy running and the cage that 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.610
 never learned to talk to her 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.349
 because she gets charged is a point I 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.410
 I think zune has to leave, it's going to stay. 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.669
 It has to be perfect and it is not perfect 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.279
 I need to try experimenting 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.559
 experiment until the fluid moment in 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.239
 body a new practice that there is this 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.710
 person makes a move and you do not 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.260
 imagine the story is that the person 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.390
 carries locks that freed 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.789
 do that if you give in and let it flow 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.589
 giving you not only well taken by 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.629
 too much detail 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.359
 these little little details 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.829
 end up distracting you by downloading the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.050
 level of your feeling 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.039
 You get nervous because it was that 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.460
 little way 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.650
 I wanted him to do it and get there. 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.500
 to climb a new partner to ugly, huh? 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.130
 My son now you're not ugly, my 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 medicine 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 we get nervous when we're little 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 Details 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.800
 people often find it 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 people with a drawing although places 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.570
 language of the person is not visual 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 sometimes it is more synaesthetic more 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.760
 have gotten like to hear now feel 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.010
 not look up that each person has 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.180
 to think about this set when I had a visual 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.680
 body language is spoken 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 totally different from a person to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.930
 the other 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'm here to tell you something. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.580
 absolutely unbelievable 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.830
 you are gods and goddesses you 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.720
 Forget that we have a strength. 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.979
 infinite within us 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.630
 we do not believe in our potential 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.000
 there never was a person listening to them 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 please never existed a person like 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
 you before 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.050
 There is no one in this world like you. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.630
 now and never will 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.520
 see only the respect that life has for 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 you 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.250
 you are a work of art it is impossible to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.209
 repeating is incomparable absolutely 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.440
 single 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.370
 We'll see every day in the morning. 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.250
 thank the universe as we are 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.140
 free nine public works so 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.660
 there is identity if I can have one 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.260
 twin brother I 'm going to take the identity I 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.370
 I still have my digital different 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.160
 because I am the only one we are the only one 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.530
 woman to fight and because they share 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.280
 this to a roommate until 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.200
 will come into discussion are the many times 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.820
 The story I had is different from the story. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.400
 story that the person having what I 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.780
 I carry the cuirasses and I carry it. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.580
 different from hers 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.370
 so why not respect my time? 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.630
 respect her time and follow in 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.630
 harmony with people 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.400
 earn a living we are not responsible 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.170
 and 100% for what we do each 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.900
 thinking that we have created our 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 future has left a problem that remains 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.340
 chicken every thought I created my future 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.300
 because it changes the thinking and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.300
 vibration now
