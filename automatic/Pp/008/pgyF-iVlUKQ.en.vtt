to<00:00:27.850> do<00:00:28.060> the<00:00:28.150> touchdown<00:00:28.390> sideswipe<00:00:29.260> all<00:00:30.039> right

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
to do the touchdown sideswipe all right

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.279 
to do the touchdown sideswipe all right
so<00:00:30.340> for<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.550> touchdown<00:00:30.789> sideswipe<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:32.169> don't

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
so for the touchdown sideswipe you don't

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.569 
so for the touchdown sideswipe you don't
want<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.469> make<00:00:32.590> sure<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:33.039> have<00:00:33.219> a<00:00:33.250> good

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
want to make sure that you have a good

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.879 
want to make sure that you have a good
touchdown<00:00:34.210> race<00:00:34.449> this<00:00:35.109> is<00:00:35.319> a<00:00:35.350> very<00:00:35.679> very

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:35.889 
touchdown race this is a very very

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:37.169 
touchdown race this is a very very
important<00:00:36.309> prerequisite<00:00:36.819> for<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.030> move

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
important prerequisite for the move

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:38.910 
important prerequisite for the move
basically<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.719> basis<00:00:38.109> for<00:00:38.229> the<00:00:38.319> entire<00:00:38.440> move

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
basically the basis for the entire move

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.889 
basically the basis for the entire move
because<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.609> touchdown<00:00:40.059> swipe<00:00:40.359> is<00:00:40.569> nothing

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
because the touchdown swipe is nothing

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.930 
because the touchdown swipe is nothing
but<00:00:41.019> a<00:00:41.079> variation<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.460> for<00:00:42.639> the<00:00:42.699> touchdown

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
but a variation so for the touchdown

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.049 
but a variation so for the touchdown

to tour de force to achieve this I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.879 
to tour de force to achieve this I
measure<00:00:57.280> with<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.639> first<00:00:57.909> arm<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.529> what

swing measure touch touch so as you see

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.960 
swing measure touch touch so as you see
in<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.350> touchdown<00:01:14.740> trace<00:01:14.950> when<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.670> execute

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
in the touchdown trace when I execute

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000 
in the touchdown trace when I execute
the<00:01:16.210> move<00:01:16.390> my<00:01:16.810> right<00:01:16.990> leg<00:01:17.260> here<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.920> to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
the move my right leg here is going to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.410 
the move my right leg here is going to
carry<00:01:18.250> all<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.610> way<00:01:18.670> through<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.120> I'm<00:01:19.210> going

like<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.680> said<00:01:20.740> before<00:01:21.060> measure<00:01:22.060> whether<00:01:23.310> I'm

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
like I said before measure whether I'm

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.550 
like I said before measure whether I'm
going<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.640> stay<00:01:24.880> all<00:01:25.060> night<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:26.470> I'm

going to stay all night like when I'm

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.500 
going to stay all night like when I'm
going<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.800> touch<00:01:26.979> down<00:01:27.010> swipe<00:01:27.610> I'm<00:01:28.270> going<00:01:28.450> to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
going to touch down swipe I'm going to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to touch down swipe I'm going to
wait<00:01:28.690> until<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:29.110> leg<00:01:29.380> reaches<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.490> 12<00:01:30.760> and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
wait until this leg reaches the 12 and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.060 
wait until this leg reaches the 12 and
that's<00:01:31.479> what<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.810> want<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> execute<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.800> switch

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
that's what I want to execute the switch

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.070 
that's what I want to execute the switch
much<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> gator<00:01:34.119> switch<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.630> hold<00:01:34.869> my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
much like a gator switch you hold my

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.570 
much like a gator switch you hold my
hand<00:01:35.290> on<00:01:35.410> the<00:01:35.470> floor<00:01:35.880> measure<00:01:36.880> magic<00:01:37.270> fall<00:01:38.580> now

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
hand on the floor measure magic fall now

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.950 
hand on the floor measure magic fall now
what's<00:01:39.790> important<00:01:40.180> about<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.479> touch<00:01:40.690> swipe

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
what's important about the touch swipe

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.460 
what's important about the touch swipe
is<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.830> remember<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> keep<00:01:42.580> your<00:01:42.759> hips

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
is to remember to keep your hips

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.749 
is to remember to keep your hips
straighten<00:01:44.470> when<00:01:44.950> you're<00:01:45.070> going<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.399> execute

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
straighten when you're going to execute

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.210 
straighten when you're going to execute
the<00:01:46.060> switch<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.590> why<00:01:47.710> we<00:01:47.830> wait<00:01:47.979> for<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
the switch this is why we wait for the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.790 
the switch this is why we wait for the
12<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:51.340> how<00:01:51.460> my<00:01:51.580> body<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:52.030> straight<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
12 see how my body is straight when I

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.520 
12 see how my body is straight when I
execute<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.720> we're<00:01:55.720> going<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.020> wait<00:01:56.200> for<00:01:56.410> my

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
body to be straightened out and that's

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.900 
body to be straightened out and that's
what<00:01:59.770> I'm<00:01:59.830> going<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.130> swing<00:02:00.399> my<00:02:00.430> other<00:02:00.759> leg

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
what I'm going to swing my other leg
