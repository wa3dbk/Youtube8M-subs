streets got a little pin on that bad boy
and<00:02:30.220> then<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.580> kind<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.850> start<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:32.850> guess<00:02:33.850> kind

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
and then just kind of start I guess kind

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.490 
and then just kind of start I guess kind
of<00:02:34.180> filling<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> spots<00:02:35.140> where<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.440> a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
of filling in the spots where it's a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.370 
of filling in the spots where it's a
little<00:02:35.739> little<00:02:36.070> extra<00:02:36.430> streaky<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.750> mean

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
little little extra streaky and I mean

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.110 
little little extra streaky and I mean
you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:39.130> know<00:02:39.280> you're<00:02:39.880> not<00:02:39.970> really

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
you know you know you're not really

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
repainting it you're just kind of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.610 
repainting it you're just kind of
touching<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.730> up<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.239> doesn't<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.900> guess

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
touching it up so it doesn't I guess

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.979

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
look so streaky alright so now we were

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.420 
look so streaky alright so now we were
gonna<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.350> we're<00:02:47.500> gonna<00:02:47.560> add<00:02:47.800> some<00:02:47.830> stars

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
gonna do is we're gonna add some stars

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.979 
gonna do is we're gonna add some stars
what<00:02:48.820> we<00:02:48.970> want<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.239> do<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:49.570> want<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.750> start

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
what we want to do is we want to start

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.509 
what we want to do is we want to start
with<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.230> stars<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.739> are<00:02:50.890> furthest<00:02:51.340> away

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
with the stars that are furthest away

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.490 
with the stars that are furthest away
and<00:02:51.940> then<00:02:52.480> painting<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.019> ones<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.380> are

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
and then painting the ones that are

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.380 
and then painting the ones that are
gonna<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.830> closer<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.489> got<00:02:54.760> three

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
gonna get closer so I got three

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.780 
gonna get closer so I got three
different<00:02:55.540> star<00:02:56.019> colors<00:02:56.380> I'm<00:02:56.590> using<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:57.670> I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
different star colors I'm using then I'm

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.090 
different star colors I'm using then I'm
gonna<00:02:57.910> make<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.480> black<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.019> white<00:02:59.260> what

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
gonna make the black with the white what

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.800 
gonna make the black with the white what
I'm<00:03:00.250> gonna<00:03:00.400> leave<00:03:00.640> pure<00:03:00.940> white<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.660> will

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
I'm gonna leave pure white so this will

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.330 
I'm gonna leave pure white so this will
be<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.019> stars<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.470> are<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.650> closest<00:03:03.160> or

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
be the stars that are like closest or

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.910 
be the stars that are like closest or
brightest<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.840> going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.110> be<00:03:05.230> partially

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
brightest this is going to be partially

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.400 
brightest this is going to be partially
grayed<00:03:06.190> out<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.360> gonna<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.660> pretty<00:03:08.140> great

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
grayed out this is gonna be pretty great

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.009 
grayed out this is gonna be pretty great
out<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:09.880> we're<00:03:10.209> gonna<00:03:10.330> make<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.780> pretty

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
out just so we're gonna make it a pretty

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.979 
out just so we're gonna make it a pretty
great<00:03:11.260> out<00:03:11.290> one<00:03:11.650> first<00:03:12.690> because<00:03:13.690> these<00:03:13.810> are

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
great out one first because these are

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.039 
great out one first because these are
gonna<00:03:14.079> be<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.260> ones<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.739> are<00:03:15.900> furthest<00:03:16.900> away

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
gonna be the ones that are furthest away

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.569 
gonna be the ones that are furthest away
and<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.769> they're<00:03:17.920> kind<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.190> they're<00:03:18.340> gonna<00:03:18.430> be

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
and so they're kind of they're gonna be

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.039 
and so they're kind of they're gonna be
harder<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:18.910> see<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.480> know<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.780> kind<00:03:20.019> of

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
harder to see you know that kind of

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.050 
harder to see you know that kind of
stuff<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.829> get<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> good<00:03:21.220> mix<00:03:21.489> go<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.880> there

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
stuff so just get a good mix go in there

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.640 
stuff so just get a good mix go in there
and<00:03:22.269> then<00:03:23.079> what<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.829> probably<00:03:24.250> want<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.850> do<00:03:25.060> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and then what I probably want to do is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.310 
and then what I probably want to do is
not<00:03:26.650> even<00:03:26.799> mix<00:03:27.130> another<00:03:27.370> black<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.910> with<00:03:28.090> this

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
not even mix another black in with this

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.509 
not even mix another black in with this
with<00:03:29.320> this<00:03:29.440> next<00:03:29.709> step<00:03:29.950> probably<00:03:30.340> want<00:03:30.459> a

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
with this next step probably want a

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.259 
with this next step probably want a
white<00:03:30.700> wipe<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.180> off<00:03:31.450> quite<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> bit<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:33.269> then

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
white wipe this off quite a bit and then

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.479 
white wipe this off quite a bit and then
start<00:03:34.780> mixing<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.709> up<00:03:35.890> with<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> little

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
start mixing this one up with a little

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.080 
start mixing this one up with a little
bit<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.730> gray<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.739> it'll<00:03:39.160> still<00:03:39.400> be<00:03:39.549> white<00:03:39.820> I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
bit of gray so it'll still be white I

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.400 
bit of gray so it'll still be white I
don't<00:03:40.209> want<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.660> get<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> little<00:03:40.900> bit<00:03:41.079> more<00:03:41.230> gray

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
don't want to get a little bit more gray

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.940

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.699

of<00:03:45.250> how<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.299> can<00:03:46.570> create<00:03:46.900> some<00:03:47.170> depth<00:03:47.410> there

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
of how you can create some depth there

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.229 
of how you can create some depth there
when<00:03:48.040> you're<00:03:48.160> painting<00:03:48.489> your<00:03:48.579> stars<00:03:48.940> in
