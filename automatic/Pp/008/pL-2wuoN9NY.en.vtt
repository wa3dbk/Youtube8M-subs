 we have been organizing for several years 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.720
 as artistic as taste so 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.119
 we have a lot of artistic pieces 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 first of all, were not 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.880
 apprentices it can be workers 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.870
 then here we guess a few 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 piece of cake that's chocolate 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.850
 theme it's japan obviously it's 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.829
 the guest of honor 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 the theme is Japan is there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 who are still in training who are 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.039
 so in training of btm we will 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 ask what is asked them at the base 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.250
 we ask them to give them a theme and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.329
 after they do as they want 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.510
 creativity essentially 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.789
 basically creativity is 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 naturally a know-how to savor 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.949
 their know-how 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 it is eaten after you taste it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.230
 said it's good you I just have it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 there is nothing to eat 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.100
 it's sugar naturally it's 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.080
 sweet chocolate but there's nothing to eat 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.820
 here is that poland how many 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 pieces present you here the person 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.170
 participates in a fortnight 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.400
 so who says contest says jury you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 have selected some personalities 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 who work this morning that they judge 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.430
 on piece that's it now they're going 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.450
 first judged by the eye so he goes 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.340
 naturally look first at the product 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 to see the band of the product 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 in the living of skill products 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.720
 then brest like selling a car 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.130
 me it's the same beats often 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.840
 pretty salable all that is in the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.650
 showcase is salable really has no 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.350
 worry d so it's first judged by the eye 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 ok then his supporters yes it will be 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.770
 judged by the cup to see the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.370
 crisp those things there and then to 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.650
 the tasting 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.840
 one of the jury members and our 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.790
 masterchef hanoune nicolas rieffel we're going 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.510
 meet him in a short moment 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.220
 it's important for these apprentices these 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.130
 professionals to participate in this kind 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.930
 of competitions to show their know-how 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 he and his rooms is back again because 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 it's true that the competitions had 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.930
 a little bit a moment he had a little 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.430
 little we will say 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.539
 we had a little less public a little 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 fewer people who wanted them 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.840
 wanted to invest or bet on 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.470
 masterchef i think that masterchef all 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.110
 Top chef 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
 all of these things have tastes to the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.120
 cooking would make young people's taste for 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.500
 to invest outside the hours of 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.530
 work after working hours of 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 do some work for parts 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.950
 artistic piece is how many hours 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.480
 of work that can represent up to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.580
 a hundred hours does not begin 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.380
 really applied when we see the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.730
 background work the little things I 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.670
 will present you after a piece of a 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.650
 meter and we really see the lap the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.770
 small perfection the small refinement 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.690
 the little detail that the day 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.239
 see this is a business card 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.620
 for after 8 naturally won race 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.820
 to visiting eyes we put that in the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.830
 pastry look what i can do 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.480
 we think that if he knows how to do that he can 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.010
 to make a simple millefeuille and make 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.190
 a great thing and for the young and 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.290
 it's also on his cv later all 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.940
 the contests will be on his resume when he 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.739
 is styled for a job he 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.030
 will have if he won competitions he will have 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.840
 more likely than another who did not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.840
 never done 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.060
 hello sylvain hello when we see in 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.410

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.400
 little green frogs really 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.450
 well anyway 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.530
 it's often what impresses 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.510
 my size your job is to sell 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.650
 almond paste and at the same time ben 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.820
 you get to do small subjects 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.490
 that's it going to end or that kind of 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.720
 things that normally in the belly 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.840
 consumers 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.400
 we're not sure that's a lot like that 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.800
 yes it likes a lot 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.360
 Ben Jean has been living for 20 years 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.430
 over twenty even so I'm doing that 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.870
 this all year so people say 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.870
 play all year round it's a little bit true 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.670
 a lot you seem to kill god listening 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.480
 yeah well there must be because 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.310
 it's still the competition of the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.600
 yarrow of the year so I have 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.010
 to be studious and then if they do super 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 well as said my hand I can not 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.800
 cut my millefeuille so you 're fine 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.800
 help me but yes my cute 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.209
 it's not how to give the beaker a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.209
 incredible masterchef 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.740
 images we see each other in a quarter 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.780
 of time then suddenly very well we judge 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.199
 what we saw before was very 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.139
 beautiful pieces 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.630
 here we taste and if the goal is to 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.160
 the visual aspect respect taste and 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.690
 especially the technical aspect so there as 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.389
 you can see it right behind us 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.710
 one of the pastry chefs ' mdd anyway 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.840
 who is doing a cutting and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.580
 we must judge by the eye in fact the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.050
 ease of cutting when listening 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.340
 not that it does not make you for example ben 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.699
 here is the cut as you can see in 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.190
 a net 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.470
 so this aspect must be judged 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.490
 to say to each other here we are customers I 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.199

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.650
 do you have the eye too to tell you 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.479
 well no this form it does not stick to 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.650
 expectations of the moment this banon taste is 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.539
 old-fashioned today it takes something 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.759
 more than if you can have that 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.620
