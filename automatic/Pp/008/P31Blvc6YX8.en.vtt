Killer<00:05:06.360> Circuit<00:05:06.870> wasn't<00:05:07.230> it<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:07.590> if<00:05:07.890> you're<00:05:08.130> a

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
Killer Circuit wasn't it so if you're a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.760 
Killer Circuit wasn't it so if you're a
beginner<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.790> one<00:05:09.510> circuit<00:05:09.960> tires<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.650> know

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
beginner and one circuit tires you know

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.010 
beginner and one circuit tires you know
that's<00:05:11.400> totally<00:05:11.640> cool<00:05:11.940> stick<00:05:12.690> with<00:05:12.840> one

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
that's totally cool stick with one

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.810 
that's totally cool stick with one
circuit<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.620> will<00:05:13.800> advance<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.190> two<00:05:14.400> circuits

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
circuit you will advance to two circuits

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.330 
circuit you will advance to two circuits
if<00:05:15.180> you're<00:05:15.870> an<00:05:15.960> intermediate<00:05:16.200> go<00:05:16.980> ahead<00:05:17.220> and

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
if you're an intermediate go ahead and

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.160 
if you're an intermediate go ahead and
start<00:05:17.640> with<00:05:17.790> two<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.420> three<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:18.990> you're

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
start with two to three and if you're

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.050 
start with two to three and if you're
advanced<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:19.590> can<00:05:20.070> probably<00:05:20.250> hit<00:05:20.490> four<00:05:20.790> sets

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
advanced you can probably hit four sets

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.900 
advanced you can probably hit four sets
of<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:21.950> work<00:05:22.950> your<00:05:22.980> butt<00:05:23.250> off<00:05:23.280> burn<00:05:23.670> a<00:05:23.700> ton

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
can be holding the dumbbell my Rose you

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.710 
can be holding the dumbbell my Rose you
just<00:05:49.110> be<00:05:49.290> throwing<00:05:50.100> with<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:51.360> dumbbell

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
just be throwing with the dumbbell

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.890 
just be throwing with the dumbbell
instead<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.170> barbell<00:05:52.530> okay<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:53.550> if<00:05:54.270> you
