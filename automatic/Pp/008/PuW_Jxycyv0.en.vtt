a piece of board again we're going to be

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.440 
a piece of board again we're going to be
using<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.010> white<00:00:08.189> display<00:00:08.460> board<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> 2,000

micron<00:00:09.750> card<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.170> we're<00:00:10.290> using<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.250> time

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
micron card that we're using this time

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.879 
micron card that we're using this time
we've<00:00:11.580> got<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> photographic<00:00:12.300> print<00:00:12.889> slightly

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we've got a photographic print slightly

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.680 
we've got a photographic print slightly
different<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.580> paper<00:00:14.849> prints<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.450> used

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
different to paper prints that we used

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.130 
different to paper prints that we used
earlier<00:00:15.839> poster<00:00:16.410> prints<00:00:16.619> movie<00:00:16.920> posters<00:00:17.340> etc

earlier poster prints movie posters etc
with<00:00:19.140> photographic<00:00:19.650> prints<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
with photographic prints you have a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.609 
with photographic prints you have a
plastic<00:00:20.789> emulsion<00:00:21.420> basically<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> plastic

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
plastic emulsion basically a plastic

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.840 
plastic emulsion basically a plastic
surface<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> top<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
surface that's over the top of the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.519 
surface that's over the top of the
photograph<00:00:24.269> helps<00:00:24.900> protect<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> image

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
photograph helps protect the image

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.830 
photograph helps protect the image
underneath<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.580> also<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:27.180> actually<00:00:27.570> stops

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
underneath but also this actually stops

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.779 
underneath but also this actually stops
the<00:00:27.960> photograph<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.529> being<00:00:28.740> breathable<00:00:29.220> so

move<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> board<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> way<00:00:41.840> take<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
move the board out of the way take a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.410 
move the board out of the way take a
piece<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> dry<00:00:43.440> mounting<00:00:43.739> tissue<00:00:45.410> okay

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
piece of dry mounting tissue okay

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.290 
piece of dry mounting tissue okay
cutting<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> piece<00:00:48.660> again<00:00:49.050> half<00:00:49.710> inch

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300

maybe<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.680> roll<00:01:01.829> them<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.219> pop<00:01:02.699> them

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
maybe just roll them up and pop them

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
maybe just roll them up and pop them
inside<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> core<00:01:03.570> they'll<00:01:03.750> come<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> handy

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
inside the core they'll come in handy

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.810 
inside the core they'll come in handy
for<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:04.890> at<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.369> stage<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> again<00:01:07.820> take

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
for something at one stage so again take

got<00:02:02.860> it<00:02:02.950> set<00:02:03.190> at<00:02:03.220> 3<00:02:03.580> minutes<00:02:04.530> set<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:05.650> 3<00:02:05.830> minutes

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
got it set at 3 minutes set at 3 minutes

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.810 
got it set at 3 minutes set at 3 minutes
20<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.330> again<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> 20<00:02:08.020> seconds<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.679> there<00:02:08.890> to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
20 so again the 20 seconds is there to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.360 
20 so again the 20 seconds is there to
allow<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.060> vacuum<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.600> pull<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.770> 3<00:02:12.040> minutes

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
allow the vacuum to pull the 3 minutes

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.800 
allow the vacuum to pull the 3 minutes
is<00:02:12.520> at<00:02:12.670> roughly<00:02:12.940> about<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.240> time<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:13.660> going

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
is at roughly about the time it's going

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
is at roughly about the time it's going
to<00:02:13.870> take<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.170> process<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:14.710> work<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.460> you're

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
to take to process this work so you're

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.830 
to take to process this work so you're
going<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.730> treat<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> photograph<00:02:16.420> pretty<00:02:16.660> much

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
going to treat a photograph pretty much

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.980 
going to treat a photograph pretty much
the<00:02:17.020> same<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:17.860> would<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.310> treating

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
the same that you would you be treating

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.810 
the same that you would you be treating
foam<00:02:19.990> centreboard<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.490> are<00:02:21.640> mounting

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
foam centreboard and if you are mounting

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.000 
foam centreboard and if you are mounting
photographs<00:02:22.480> onto<00:02:22.660> firm<00:02:22.930> centered<00:02:23.290> board<00:02:23.500> be

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
photographs onto firm centered board be

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.440 
photographs onto firm centered board be
doubly<00:02:24.430> wary<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:25.060> there's<00:02:25.240> no

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
doubly wary because there's no

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
doubly wary because there's no
breathability<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.200> either<00:02:26.350> direction<00:02:26.530> so

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
breathability in either direction so

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.070 
breathability in either direction so
that<00:02:27.520> would<00:02:27.700> probably<00:02:27.910> need<00:02:28.390> even<00:02:28.600> longer<00:02:28.959> in

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that would probably need even longer in

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.380 
that would probably need even longer in
the<00:02:29.140> press
