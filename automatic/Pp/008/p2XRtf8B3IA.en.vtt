exhale<00:01:27.730> roll<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.090> so<00:01:28.870> this<00:01:29.080> may<00:01:29.409> look<00:01:29.680> simple

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
exhale roll up so this may look simple

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250 
exhale roll up so this may look simple
but<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.700> are<00:01:30.880> really<00:01:31.600> pulling<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.140> our

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260

abdominals inhale exhale and I'm moving

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.000 
abdominals inhale exhale and I'm moving
this<00:01:37.540> slow<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.860> an

ABS<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.259> up<00:01:59.380> let's<00:01:59.710> do<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.399> one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
ABS in and up let's do this just one

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.910 
ABS in and up let's do this just one
more<00:02:00.940> time<00:02:01.770> inhale<00:02:02.770> exhale<00:02:04.410> press<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.680> feet

more time inhale exhale press the feet

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160 
more time inhale exhale press the feet
you'll<00:02:06.430> feel<00:02:06.700> more<00:02:06.910> stable<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.899> it's

you'll feel more stable and it's
definitely<00:02:08.709> more<00:02:09.070> challenging<00:02:09.850> on<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.270> BOK

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
definitely more challenging on the BOK

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.770 
definitely more challenging on the BOK
lower<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.560> arms<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.280> roll<00:02:13.000> back<00:02:13.510> up

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
so moving on inhale let's do the same

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.390 
so moving on inhale let's do the same
pelvic<00:02:18.910> tilt<00:02:19.269> arms<00:02:20.019> reaching<00:02:20.350> by<00:02:20.830> your<00:02:21.070> ears
