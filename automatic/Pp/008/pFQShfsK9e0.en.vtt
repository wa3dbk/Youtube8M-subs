00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello i remember emilie i'm 20 years old 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.900
 in 2010 I got my bac stg are 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 all there on teknologik of management and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.860
 in 2012 in July of last year 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 I got my dut gea management of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 companies and administrations in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 February 2012 given I wanted to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 reorient I registered at the center 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.850
 European training to pass the course 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 and early childhood by correspondence 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 so in fact I decided to go through 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 correspondence because I wanted 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.250
 I had my job to be able to work at 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.149
 so I started receiving my classes 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 in April of last year 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 so I found that the courses were 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 very explicit he was going to the point 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 so the singers did such 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.430
