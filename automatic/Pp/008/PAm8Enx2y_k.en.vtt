00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
be changed is going to be more I guess

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.760

more<00:01:00.970> for<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.570> long<00:01:01.780> distance<00:01:02.290> or<00:01:02.410> something

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
more for the long distance or something

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.139 
more for the long distance or something
that's<00:01:02.920> what<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.190> got<00:01:03.460> from<00:01:03.610> me<00:01:03.760> off<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:04.119> know

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
that's what I got from me off you know

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.349 
that's what I got from me off you know
the<00:01:04.420> statement<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:06.159> know<00:01:06.359> quickscoping

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:07.359 
the statement and you know quickscoping

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.379 
the statement and you know quickscoping
is<00:01:07.509> going<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.960> be<00:01:08.200> taken<00:01:08.889> out<00:01:09.039> or<00:01:09.310> maybe<00:01:09.880> taken

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:10.389 
is going to be taken out or maybe taken

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:12.899 
is going to be taken out or maybe taken
out<00:01:10.539> actually<00:01:11.200> maybe<00:01:12.039> you<00:01:12.159> have<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.399> use<00:01:12.579> perk

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
out actually maybe you have to use perk

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.149 
out actually maybe you have to use perk
combinations<00:01:13.749> to<00:01:14.020> make<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.649> know<00:01:14.770> work<00:01:15.009> a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
combinations to make it you know work a

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.010 
combinations to make it you know work a
lot<00:01:15.340> better<00:01:15.520> which<00:01:15.880> that's<00:01:16.450> probably<00:01:16.719> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
lot better which that's probably the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.599 
lot better which that's probably the
cause<00:01:17.200> right<00:01:17.649> there<00:01:17.859> that's<00:01:18.039> probably<00:01:18.399> what's

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
cause right there that's probably what's

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.789 
cause right there that's probably what's
going<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.819> happen<00:01:19.270> or<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:20.109> lot<00:01:20.499> of<00:01:20.560> people<00:01:20.709> going

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
going to happen or a lot of people going

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.410 
going to happen or a lot of people going
to<00:01:20.889> jump<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.369> marksman<00:01:21.789> class<00:01:21.999> you<00:01:22.270> know

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
to jump on the marksman class you know

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.349 
to jump on the marksman class you know
no<00:01:22.899> scoping<00:01:23.469> now<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:24.039> going<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.880> be<00:01:25.030> probably

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
no scoping now is going to be probably

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.660 
no scoping now is going to be probably
more<00:01:25.569> prevalent<00:01:26.079> with<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.499> than<00:01:27.189> an<00:01:27.459> actual

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
more prevalent with that than an actual

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.669 
more prevalent with that than an actual
sniper<00:01:28.149> with<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.450> scope<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.170> that's<00:01:29.380> probably

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
sniper with a scope so that's probably

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.190 
sniper with a scope so that's probably
what's<00:01:30.039> going<00:01:30.219> to<00:01:30.310> happen<00:01:30.749> which<00:01:31.749> I'm<00:01:31.990> fine

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
what's going to happen which I'm fine

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.569 
what's going to happen which I'm fine
with<00:01:32.259> that<00:01:32.499> I<00:01:32.709> really<00:01:33.069> don't<00:01:33.249> care<00:01:33.310> i'd

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
with that I really don't care i'd

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.609 
with that I really don't care i'd
actually<00:01:33.759> wouldn't<00:01:34.509> mind<00:01:34.600> using<00:01:35.020> those<00:01:35.380> i

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
actually wouldn't mind using those i

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.459 
actually wouldn't mind using those i
mean<00:01:35.770> i<00:01:35.859> am<00:01:36.789> actually<00:01:37.389> trying<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:38.139> get<00:01:38.350> the

mean i am actually trying to get the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.620 
mean i am actually trying to get the
ballista<00:01:38.979> no<00:01:39.249> scope<00:01:39.609> so<00:01:39.969> if<00:01:40.179> i<00:01:40.299> can<00:01:40.479> do<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
ballista no scope so if i can do that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.469 
ballista no scope so if i can do that
that<00:01:41.409> would<00:01:41.560> be<00:01:41.649> cool<00:01:41.969> because<00:01:42.969> i<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.359> get
