00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.820 
with the insoles that you get in the
package<00:00:26.599> these<00:00:27.830> two<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:30.590> guard<00:00:31.590> ones

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830

they<00:00:34.380> don't<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.680> much<00:00:34.920> cushioning<00:00:35.430> I'd

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
they don't have that much cushioning I'd

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.610

comfy feeling shoe and yeah and the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 
comfy feeling shoe and yeah and the
bottom<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.020> traction<00:01:43.500> pattern<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> lot

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
bottom the traction pattern it's a lot

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.510 
bottom the traction pattern it's a lot
better<00:01:44.970> than<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> previous<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.340> lot

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
better than the previous one it's a lot

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
better than the previous one it's a lot
more<00:01:47.549> spread<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.119> even<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> bad<00:01:49.020> thing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
more spread out even but the bad thing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.480 
more spread out even but the bad thing
is<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> grooves<00:01:50.869> there<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.259> thinner<00:01:53.040> so

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is it the grooves there a lot thinner so

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.819 
is it the grooves there a lot thinner so
they<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.850> get<00:01:54.240> worn<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:54.570> easier<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
they can get worn down easier when I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
they can get worn down easier when I
kind<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> worn<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.460> already<00:01:56.729> try<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> keep

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
kind of worn down already try to keep

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.740
