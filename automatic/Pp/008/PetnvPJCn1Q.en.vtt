and<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:02.039> fact<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:03.329> could<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and the fact is that these could be

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.890 
and the fact is that these could be
homes<00:01:03.960> where<00:01:04.640> people<00:01:05.640> need<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> live<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> they

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
could be rebuilt reconstructed and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
could be rebuilt reconstructed and
refurbished<00:01:09.869> nothing<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.500> happening<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
refurbished nothing is happening and the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
refurbished nothing is happening and the
question<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> answer<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> course

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
question is why and the answer of course

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
question is why and the answer of course
is<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.700> no<00:01:14.939> money<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.880> only<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
is there is no money you only have to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
is there is no money you only have to
look<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> appalling<00:01:20.630> condition<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
