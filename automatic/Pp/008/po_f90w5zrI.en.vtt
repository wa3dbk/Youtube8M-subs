hood really quick while the truck is
somewhat<00:00:04.620> taken<00:00:04.770> apart<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.450> you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
somewhat taken apart just so you can you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.870 
somewhat taken apart just so you can you
know<00:00:06.839> get<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.049> little<00:00:07.109> bit<00:00:07.470> better<00:00:07.589> view

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.070 

alternator<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.599> power<00:00:12.750> steering

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
alternator is here and power steering

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
alternator is here and power steering
pump<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> here<00:00:13.799> originally<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.519> Mercedes

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
pump is here originally on this Mercedes

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150 
pump is here originally on this Mercedes
motor<00:00:15.210> they<00:00:15.480> were<00:00:15.540> reversed<00:00:16.440> those<00:00:16.830> locations

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
motor they were reversed those locations

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.429 
motor they were reversed those locations
but<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.090> Toyota<00:00:18.420> motor<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> where

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
but on the Toyota motor this is where

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.070 
but on the Toyota motor this is where
they<00:00:19.590> were<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> reverse<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.240> back<00:00:21.539> to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
they were so I reverse them back to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.650 
they were so I reverse them back to
match<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.529> original<00:00:22.619> Toyota<00:00:23.220> location<00:00:23.699> on

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
match the original Toyota location on

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
match the original Toyota location on
the<00:00:24.779> Toyota<00:00:25.050> Motors<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:25.920> nice

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the Toyota Motors which is really nice

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.359 
the Toyota Motors which is really nice
because<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.090> alternator<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.990> a

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
because the alternator can have a

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.089 
because the alternator can have a
unmodified<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.849> completely<00:00:30.539> unmodified<00:00:31.050> a

original location as the Toyota v6 which
is<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.820> nice<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:46.289> unmodified

here<00:01:51.380> just<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> thought<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.040> need

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
here just because I thought I would need

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.620 
here just because I thought I would need
a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.119> spring<00:01:54.450> back

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
a little you know more spring back

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.560 
a little you know more spring back
tension<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.040> spring<00:01:56.880> that's<00:01:57.030> built<00:01:57.270> onto

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
tension but the spring that's built onto

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.780 
tension but the spring that's built onto
the<00:01:57.659> injection<00:01:58.110> pump<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.500> plenty<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the injection pump is plenty I like the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.069 
the injection pump is plenty I like the
softer<00:02:00.149> pedal<00:02:00.390> feel<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> suppose<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
softer pedal feel but I suppose that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350 
softer pedal feel but I suppose that
could<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.560> hooked<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.549> make<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> pedal<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
could be hooked up to make the pedal a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.010 
could be hooked up to make the pedal a
little<00:02:03.540> stiffer<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.770> over<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> got<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:06.020> K&amp;N

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little stiffer so over here we got a K&amp;N

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.540 
little stiffer so over here we got a K&amp;N

this<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.260> why<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> isolated<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> one

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
this is the one why I isolated the one

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.430 
this is the one why I isolated the one
wire<00:02:29.700> out<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.870> sends<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> signal

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
wire out of there that sends the signal

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.880 
wire out of there that sends the signal
to<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:33.150> dash<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.870> coolant<00:02:34.380> temp<00:02:34.560> sensor

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
to the the dash for coolant temp sensor

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
to the the dash for coolant temp sensor
and<00:02:35.070> then<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.850> runs<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.810> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and then it runs back here to this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.150 
and then it runs back here to this
coolant<00:02:37.320> temp<00:02:37.470> sensor<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.040> there's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
coolant temp sensor here and there's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.600 
coolant temp sensor here and there's
actually<00:02:38.490> two<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:38.940> motor<00:02:39.240> one<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.050> and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
actually two on this motor one there and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
actually two on this motor one there and
one<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:41.640> there<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> both<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> them<00:02:42.900> send<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
one right there and both of them send a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
one right there and both of them send a
signal<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.070> dash<00:02:44.520> which<00:02:45.210> is<00:02:45.330> really<00:02:45.540> nice

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
signal to the dash which is really nice
