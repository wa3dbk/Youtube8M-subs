00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
that just it takes a long time to move

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.249 
that just it takes a long time to move

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
your hand like this to turn it now what

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.990 
your hand like this to turn it now what
I'm<00:01:05.350> gonna<00:01:05.530> teach<00:01:05.830> you<00:01:05.979> today<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.640> something

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
I'm gonna teach you today is something

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.450 
I'm gonna teach you today is something
called<00:01:07.179> finger<00:01:07.840> tricks<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:08.380> finger<00:01:09.160> tricks

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
called finger tricks and finger tricks

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.719 
called finger tricks and finger tricks
are<00:01:09.759> going<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.390> be<00:01:10.570> used<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.740> lot<00:01:12.009> in<00:01:12.190> algorithms

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
are going to be used a lot in algorithms

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.710 
are going to be used a lot in algorithms
to<00:01:13.000> make<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.509> just<00:01:13.840> get<00:01:14.500> faster<00:01:15.720> essentially

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
to make you just get faster essentially

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.350 
to make you just get faster essentially
what<00:01:16.899> finger<00:01:17.080> tricks<00:01:17.470> does<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:18.670> takes<00:01:19.000> a<00:01:19.149> whole

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
what finger tricks does is takes a whole

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.960 
what finger tricks does is takes a whole
hand<00:01:19.690> movement<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.350> makes<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.399> simple

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
hand movement and makes it a simple

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.780 
hand movement and makes it a simple
fluid<00:01:22.659> motion<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.890> do<00:01:24.069> with<00:01:24.640> your

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
fluid motion that you do with your

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.310 
fluid motion that you do with your
finger<00:01:25.119> that's<00:01:25.509> why<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:25.810> called<00:01:25.930> finger

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
finger that's why it's called finger

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.550 
finger that's why it's called finger
tricks<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:28.000> right<00:01:28.299> now<00:01:28.509> I'm<00:01:28.899> going<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.259> perform

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
tricks so right now I'm going to perform

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.370 
tricks so right now I'm going to perform
that<00:01:29.680> algorithm<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.460> just<00:01:30.850> performed<00:01:31.380> using

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
that algorithm I just performed using

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.139 
that algorithm I just performed using
finger<00:01:32.710> tricks<00:01:35.070> makes<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.430> whole<00:01:37.119> lot

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
finger tricks makes it a whole lot

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.240 
finger tricks makes it a whole lot
faster<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.110> mean<00:01:38.259> that's<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:38.680> as<00:01:38.860> fast<00:01:39.070> as

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
faster and I mean that's not as fast as

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.700 
faster and I mean that's not as fast as
I<00:01:39.399> can<00:01:39.460> do<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.170> awkwardly<00:01:41.170> holding<00:01:41.590> it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
I can do it just awkwardly holding it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.719 
I can do it just awkwardly holding it
but<00:01:41.939> let's<00:01:42.939> not<00:01:43.060> get<00:01:43.240> into<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.250> what<00:01:45.700> you

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
but let's not get into that so what you

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.789 
but let's not get into that so what you
want<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.030> do<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.390> do<00:01:46.509> finger<00:01:46.869> tricks<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.320> you

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
want to do to do finger tricks is you

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.319 
want to do to do finger tricks is you
want<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.009> have<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.189> good<00:01:48.490> understanding<00:01:48.549> of

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
want to have a good understanding of

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.999 
want to have a good understanding of
what<00:01:49.539> layers<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:50.110> need<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.380> move<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.829> what

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
what layers you need to move in what

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.310 
what layers you need to move in what
algorithms<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:52.090> need<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.420> think<00:01:52.659> ahead<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
algorithms you need to think ahead and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380 
algorithms you need to think ahead and
think<00:01:53.590> about<00:01:53.680> your<00:01:53.950> algorithms<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.700> practice

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
think about your algorithms and practice

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.510 
think about your algorithms and practice
your<00:01:55.539> algorithms<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:56.500> by<00:01:57.280> themselves

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
your algorithms just by themselves

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.429 
your algorithms just by themselves
without<00:01:58.090> solving<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.810> Rubik's<00:01:59.140> Cube

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
without solving a Rubik's Cube

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.249 
without solving a Rubik's Cube
so<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.310> algorithm<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.909> just<00:02:01.149> showed<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.420> all

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
so that algorithm I just showed you all

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.920 
so that algorithm I just showed you all
algorithms<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.399> do<00:02:03.609> if<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.689> keep

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
algorithms that you do if you keep

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.509 
algorithms that you do if you keep
repeating<00:02:05.200> them<00:02:06.090> will<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:08.250> back<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.489> a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
repeating them will get you back to a

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.060 
repeating them will get you back to a
completed<00:02:10.030> cube<00:02:10.420> from<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.959> completed<00:02:11.560> cube<00:02:11.829> so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
completed cube from a completed cube so

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.160 
completed cube from a completed cube so
I<00:02:12.100> start<00:02:12.549> with<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.820> completed<00:02:13.359> cube<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.930> just

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I start with a completed cube and I just

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.110 
I start with a completed cube and I just
practice<00:02:14.560> my<00:02:14.739> algorithms<00:02:15.220> which<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.060> to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
practice my algorithms which is going to

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.690 
practice my algorithms which is going to
get<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> lot<00:02:16.660> faster<00:02:17.049> in<00:02:17.140> general<00:02:17.560> just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
get you a lot faster in general just

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.949 
get you a lot faster in general just
thinking<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:19.060> algorithms<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.750> being

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
thinking about your algorithms and being

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.110 
thinking about your algorithms and being
to<00:02:20.230> being<00:02:20.799> able<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.070> do<00:02:21.310> them<00:02:21.519> from<00:02:21.730> muscle

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
to being able to do them from muscle

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.460 
to being able to do them from muscle
memory<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.600> not<00:02:22.720> having<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.019> think<00:02:23.109> about

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
memory and not having to think about

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.710 
memory and not having to think about
them<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.209> thinking<00:02:25.450> about

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
them that way you can be thinking about

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.509 
them that way you can be thinking about
the<00:02:25.930> next<00:02:25.959> step<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.910> finger<00:02:28.299> tricks<00:02:28.600> are

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
the next step so finger tricks are

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.630 
the next step so finger tricks are
simple<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:31.090> want<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.449> hold<00:02:32.549> with
