00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.270 
will
but<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> meantime<00:01:05.440> you<00:01:05.680> should<00:01:05.710> shut<00:01:06.009> off<00:01:06.160> the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
but the meantime you should shut off the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.700 
but the meantime you should shut off the
music<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.820> draws<00:01:07.000> attention

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
music it draws attention

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.120 
music it draws attention
nothing<00:01:08.710> enters<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.549> do<00:01:09.729> not<00:01:10.240> wish<00:01:10.659> now<00:01:11.619> I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
nothing enters that I do not wish now I

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:22.460 
nothing enters that I do not wish now I
must<00:01:13.000> prepare<00:01:13.119> my<00:01:13.869> mind

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.460 

so<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> cut<00:01:23.610> forward<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.260> spend

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so I cut forward I'm not going to spend

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
so I cut forward I'm not going to spend
my<00:01:25.620> night<00:01:25.800> here<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.340> gonna<00:01:26.520> spend<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.970> night

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
my night here I'm gonna spend my night

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.780 
my night here I'm gonna spend my night
in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.510> closest<00:01:28.170> safe<00:01:28.950> house<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
in the closest safe house to the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
in the closest safe house to the
riverbank<00:01:31.880> which<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> here

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.920 

so<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.800> don't<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.490> run

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
so I don't have to run

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.400 
so I don't have to run
a<00:01:49.990> long<00:01:50.350> time<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.580> river<00:01:51.790> bank<00:01:52.260> so<00:01:53.260> no

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
a long time to get it a river bank so no

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:39.960 
a long time to get it a river bank so no
you<00:01:53.470> might<00:01:53.830> be<00:01:54.130> more<00:01:54.460> risky<00:01:54.910> but<00:01:56.550> I'm<00:01:57.550> not

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.550 

so<00:02:40.970> getting<00:02:41.180> there<00:02:41.450> wasn't<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.780> difficult

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
so getting there wasn't that difficult

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.150 
so getting there wasn't that difficult
but<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.160> tried<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.670> experiment<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.780> bit

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
but I tried to experiment a bit

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.000 
but I tried to experiment a bit
remember<00:02:46.160> Dahlia<00:02:46.730> from<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.870> slums<00:02:48.230> that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
remember Dahlia from the slums that

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.000 
remember Dahlia from the slums that
which<00:02:49.540> she<00:02:50.540> gave<00:02:50.690> me<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.960> shroom<00:02:51.320> potion<00:02:51.890> I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
which she gave me that shroom potion I

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.860 
which she gave me that shroom potion I
never<00:02:52.310> figured<00:02:52.730> out<00:02:52.880> or<00:02:53.180> never<00:02:53.330> used<00:02:53.660> it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
never figured out or never used it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.740 
never figured out or never used it
before<00:02:53.990> so<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.500> tried<00:02:54.800> hmm<00:02:55.280> maybe<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.540> time

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
before so I tried hmm maybe it's time

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.210 
before so I tried hmm maybe it's time
for<00:02:57.080> Dahlia<00:02:57.680> shroom<00:02:58.190> potion<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.940> time<00:03:00.220> and

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
for Dahlia shroom potion this time and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.940 
for Dahlia shroom potion this time and
it<00:03:01.670> messes<00:03:01.940> around<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.810> controls<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.860> if

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
it messes around with the controls so if

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.650 
it messes around with the controls so if
you<00:03:04.040> go<00:03:04.160> forward<00:03:04.460> it<00:03:04.700> goes<00:03:04.850> backwards<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
you go forward it goes backwards if you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.280 
you go forward it goes backwards if you
go<00:03:05.780> left<00:03:06.020> it<00:03:06.260> actually<00:03:06.650> goes<00:03:06.800> right<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.290> all

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
go left it actually goes right and all

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.870 
go left it actually goes right and all
in<00:03:09.470> all<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.860> wasn't<00:03:10.280> really<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.550> good<00:03:10.730> idea

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
in all it wasn't really a good idea

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.420 
in all it wasn't really a good idea
because<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:12.670> was<00:03:13.870> blind<00:03:14.870> for<00:03:15.860> maybe<00:03:16.070> ten

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
because it I was blind for maybe ten

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.510 
because it I was blind for maybe ten
seconds<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.140> zombies<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.980> afterwards

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
seconds to the zombies but afterwards

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.660 
seconds to the zombies but afterwards
