leading them to a national championship

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.390 
leading them to a national championship
I<00:00:23.990> think<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.350> was<00:00:24.440> the<00:00:24.470> first<00:00:24.740> time<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:24.980> really

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
I think that was the first time I really

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.040 
I think that was the first time I really
started<00:00:25.700> feeling<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:26.720> leadership

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
started feeling that that leadership

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.830 
started feeling that that leadership
group<00:00:27.460> if<00:00:28.460> you<00:00:28.610> can't<00:00:28.880> come<00:00:29.060> into<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.390> team<00:00:29.660> and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
group if you can't come into a team and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.630 
group if you can't come into a team and
say<00:00:30.020> I'm<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:30.350> leader<00:00:30.590> a<00:00:30.860> lot<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.190> times<00:00:31.400> you<00:00:31.520> have

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.700 
to lead by example I think the small
things<00:00:35.180> that<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.750> do<00:00:35.930> this<00:00:36.110> we<00:00:36.290> got<00:00:36.500> some
