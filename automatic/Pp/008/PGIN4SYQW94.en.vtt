00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi to all to the room in this video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.890
 I will show you how to have the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.390
 bmx of all colors so that's 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 quite simple just simply 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.760
 know the place 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 many of you have asked me where 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.910
 find them so I show you that there is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.500
 really long time I showed you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 the place but some people told me that they 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.920
 went there and they did not find them 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 so I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.490
 to make them spawn more easily 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.630
 so first you have to come to 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.250
 this place on the map 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 so it's near the skate park but 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 attention you must arrive without cum 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.140
 shit here to dangerous gangs so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.179
 if you arrive that you do not care 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 brothel and that while you have not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.910
 still found your bmx 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.290
 I wish you good luck for 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 get it I tried to recover a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 bmx blue to larache I made myself 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.750
 to knock out so you really have to go 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 finesse then makes you go 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 returns between the skate park and so the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 street that belongs to gangs 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 so we do not see what there is 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.890
 gangsters everywhere and in fact 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.600
 you will find either bikes laid that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 no one is using then there you can 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 take them without problem against if 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 the bike is used by someone go out 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 your shotgun or some other weapon and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.270
 knock out everything you can and everything 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.350
 what you see around you for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.000
 take the bmx 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 otherwise you will be shot 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.119
 and you will be pursued by 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.920
 cars so it's not practical 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 when you have recovered a bmx you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.830
 can put it in your garage and it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.420
 will be yours so in a few 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.840
 back and forth I found the colors 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.119
 blue green yellow red and gray if you 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 lose a colored bmx 6 destroyed you 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.570
 know that you can come here in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
 recover one when you want then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
 go there during the day at night there is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
 a lot less or not even at all 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 sometimes prefer also sessions 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.299
 by invitation with not too many people 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 in then for two things 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.829
 firstly if to too many people in the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.030
 session his spawn less frequently seen 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.770
 when there are people, it is often the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.299
 shit in the streets of los santos and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.400
 secondly it will be simpler for 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 you go to your garage if 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 you are in a session on 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.509
 invitation after there are other places 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.369
 on the map where you can find 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.259
 bmx but it's really here you in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.490
 find most often and also the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.439
 more simply 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.790
 there are some everywhere in the street there 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.829
 there are even people who are walking on it 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 and there is always one in front of the skate 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.020
 park 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.700
 so here I tell you good walk to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.869
 all in bmx that's all for this video 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.409
 and I tell you just now 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.409
 ciao
