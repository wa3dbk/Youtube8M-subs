okay<00:00:01.340> subscriber<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:02.639> channel<00:00:02.669> asked<00:00:03.659> me

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
okay subscriber to my channel asked me

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay subscriber to my channel asked me
to<00:00:04.049> do<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> low-light<00:00:05.190> test<00:00:05.609> comparing<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.509> FDR

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
to do a low-light test comparing the FDR

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.339 
to do a low-light test comparing the FDR
ax<00:00:07.589> 33<00:00:08.340> which<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.760> over<00:00:09.030> here<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.540> that's<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
ax 33 which is over here and that's the

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.890 
ax 33 which is over here and that's the
camera<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.889> we're<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.130> right<00:00:11.400> now<00:00:11.670> both<00:00:12.570> are

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
camera that we're on right now both are

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
camera that we're on right now both are
in<00:00:13.049> intelligent<00:00:13.620> auto<00:00:13.769> mode<00:00:13.889> by<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> way<00:00:14.610> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
in intelligent auto mode by the way we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.439 
in intelligent auto mode by the way we
have<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.570> rx100<00:00:16.139> mark<00:00:16.619> 4<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.789> side<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
have the rx100 mark 4 on this side and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.650 
have the rx100 mark 4 on this side and
I'll<00:00:19.140> cut<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.619> camera<00:00:19.890> right<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.660> okay

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I'll cut to that camera right now okay

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
I'll cut to that camera right now okay
so<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.050> see<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> difference<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.609> had

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so you can see the difference and I had

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.099 
so you can see the difference and I had
to<00:00:24.410> adjust<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.039> exposure<00:00:26.699> compensation<00:00:27.109> on

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to adjust the exposure compensation on

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.250 
to adjust the exposure compensation on
the<00:00:28.590> FDR<00:00:29.220> ax<00:00:29.640> 33<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> try<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> brighten<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.109> up

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the FDR ax 33 to try to brighten it up

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
the FDR ax 33 to try to brighten it up
some<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:32.460> even<00:00:32.730> though<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.000> both<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
some because even though they're both in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.750 
some because even though they're both in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
intelligent auto mode the rx100 mark 4

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.959 
intelligent auto mode the rx100 mark 4
was<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.420> brighter<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.020> mean<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
was was brighter I mean it just was so I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.240 
was was brighter I mean it just was so I
tried<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.570> compensate<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.070> get

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
tried to compensate for that and get

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
tried to compensate for that and get
them<00:00:44.370> closer<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.329> don't<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.899> they're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
them closer I don't know if they're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.740 
them closer I don't know if they're
they're<00:00:46.379> spot-on<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.210> but<00:00:48.210> they're<00:00:48.539> both

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
they're spot-on or not but they're both

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.160 
they're spot-on or not but they're both
at<00:00:48.960> their<00:00:49.079> widest<00:00:49.559> angle<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.960> they're<00:00:51.960> both

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
at their widest angle and they're both

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.920 
at their widest angle and they're both
at<00:00:52.649> about<00:00:52.920> F<00:00:53.190> 1.8<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> fastest<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
at about F 1.8 that's the fastest the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.380 
at about F 1.8 that's the fastest the
lenses<00:00:55.320> go<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.949> their<00:00:56.219> widest<00:00:56.610> angle<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.180> both

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
lenses go at their widest angle on both

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
lenses go at their widest angle on both
of<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:57.690> cameras<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.399> we're<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of these cameras and so we're in a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.700 
of these cameras and so we're in a
relatively<00:01:00.239> low<00:01:00.539> light<00:01:00.780> situation<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
relatively low light situation I just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
relatively low light situation I just
have<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.070> ceiling<00:01:02.579> light<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.329> there's<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
have one ceiling light up here there's a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.420 
have one ceiling light up here there's a
little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> light<00:01:04.710> coming<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
little bit of light coming in from that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.719 
little bit of light coming in from that
room<00:01:05.640> over<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.400> they've<00:01:08.400> got<00:01:08.580> some

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
room over there and they've got some

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
room over there and they've got some
lamps<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> background<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> give

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
lamps on in the background just to give

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.039 
lamps on in the background just to give
you<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> idea<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> depth<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.549> field

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
you the idea of the depth of field

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
you the idea of the depth of field
they're<00:01:13.049> both<00:01:13.229> auto<00:01:13.560> focusing<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> face

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
they're both auto focusing on the face

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.050 
they're both auto focusing on the face
and<00:01:15.470> I'm<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> switch<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.790> forth

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and I'm going to switch back and forth

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
and I'm going to switch back and forth
between<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:18.900> cameras<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:22.490> put

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
between the two cameras I'm going to put

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
between the two cameras I'm going to put
a<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.700> lower<00:01:24.540> third<00:01:24.930> saying<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.009> camera

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a little lower third saying which camera

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
a little lower third saying which camera
were<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.270> any<00:01:27.509> given<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
were on at any given time so that you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
were on at any given time so that you
can<00:01:28.770> easily<00:01:29.310> tell<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.720> cameras

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
can easily tell which of the two cameras

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
can easily tell which of the two cameras
were<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.909> should<00:01:33.150> give<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
were on but this should give you a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.039 
were on but this should give you a
pretty<00:01:34.380> good<00:01:34.850> head-to-head<00:01:35.850> comparison<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
pretty good head-to-head comparison of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.940 
pretty good head-to-head comparison of
these<00:01:38.040> two<00:01:38.100> cameras<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.850> notice<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
these two cameras you notice that the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.580 
these two cameras you notice that the
rx100<00:01:40.950> mark<00:01:41.430> 4<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> wider<00:01:42.540> field<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.350> view

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
rx100 mark 4 has a wider field of view

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.420 
rx100 mark 4 has a wider field of view
and<00:01:43.970> that's<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.630> default<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.320> has<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.530> 24

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and that's just by default it has a 24

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.330 
and that's just by default it has a 24
millimeter<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:48.030> its<00:01:48.210> widest<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.340> obviously

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
millimeter at its widest and obviously

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
millimeter at its widest and obviously
the<00:01:51.140> FDR<00:01:52.140> X<00:01:52.439> 33<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.909> wide<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.509> as

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the FDR X 33 is not that wide not as

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
the FDR X 33 is not that wide not as
wide<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> exactly<00:01:56.100> how<00:01:56.340> wide<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
wide I don't know exactly how wide it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.149 
wide I don't know exactly how wide it
goes<00:01:56.939> oh<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.180> widest<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.100> if

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
goes oh that's widest I don't know if

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
goes oh that's widest I don't know if
it's<00:01:59.280> 30<00:01:59.490> millimeter<00:02:00.030> exactly<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's 30 millimeter exactly what it is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.330 
it's 30 millimeter exactly what it is
but<00:02:01.460> obviously<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.610> not<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.969> wide<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.570> the
