00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
ready didn't take long to clean it and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.710 
ready didn't take long to clean it and
he<00:01:26.530> did<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.830> couple<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:27.190> weeks<00:01:27.310> ago<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.570> yeah

it's already now a light amount of oil
on<00:01:32.260> there<00:01:32.410> because<00:01:32.590> obviously<00:01:32.770> it's<00:01:33.010> gonna

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
on there because obviously it's gonna

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.450 
on there because obviously it's gonna
take<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.370> while<00:01:33.610> for<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.910> feed<00:01:34.120> to<00:01:34.650> properly<00:01:35.650> do

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
take a while for the feed to properly do

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.290 
take a while for the feed to properly do
the<00:01:36.580> oil<00:01:36.610> but<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.000> just<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> light

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
the oil but it's just there is a light

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.170 
the oil but it's just there is a light
amount<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.480> oil<00:01:40.630> left<00:01:41.260> on<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.560> chain<00:01:41.830> now<00:01:42.180> I'm

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
amount of oil left on the chain now I'm

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.940 
amount of oil left on the chain now I'm
just<00:01:43.690> about<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.870> start<00:01:43.960> ready

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
just about to start ready

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.500 
just about to start ready
setting<00:01:45.430> up<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.760> fit<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.810> now<00:01:48.120> right<00:01:49.120> as<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
setting up the fit in now right as you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.490 
setting up the fit in now right as you
can<00:01:49.690> see<00:01:49.870> that's<00:01:49.990> where<00:01:50.260> I've<00:01:50.410> decided<00:01:50.860> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
can see that's where I've decided to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.290 
can see that's where I've decided to
mount<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.680> oiler<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.190> there<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:56.910> really

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.490 

I'll<00:02:01.300> bike<00:02:01.570> moves<00:02:01.870> when<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.110> wobble<00:02:02.410> it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
I'll bike moves when you wobble it

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.840 
I'll bike moves when you wobble it
around<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:02.980> yeah<00:02:03.160> it's<00:02:03.280> really<00:02:03.430> nice<00:02:03.640> and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
around so yeah it's really nice and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.230 
around so yeah it's really nice and
tight<00:02:04.000> even<00:02:04.240> notes<00:02:04.390> on<00:02:04.570> cable<00:02:04.990> ties<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:07.000> yeah

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
tight even notes on cable ties so yeah

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.350 
tight even notes on cable ties so yeah
it's<00:02:07.480> very<00:02:07.600> sturdy<00:02:08.610> obviously<00:02:09.610> any<00:02:10.000> concern

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
it's very sturdy obviously any concern

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.010 
it's very sturdy obviously any concern
is<00:02:10.479> how<00:02:10.600> close<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.130> there<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
is how close the that is to there so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.930 
is how close the that is to there so
filling<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.510> cross<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.690> bridge<00:02:17.940> so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
filling it up but cross that bridge so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.910 
filling it up but cross that bridge so
and<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.690> plan<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.080> obviously<00:02:20.620> take<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and then I plan to obviously take the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
and then I plan to obviously take the
pipe<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.220> got<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> put<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> bit<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.940> loop<00:02:22.120> in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
pipe you got to put a bit of a loop in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.970 
pipe you got to put a bit of a loop in
it<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:22.600> there<00:02:22.950> today<00:02:25.410> put<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.440> bit<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.800> loop

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it just there today put a bit of a loop

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
it just there today put a bit of a loop
in<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.720> swing<00:02:28.959> arm<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.880> then<00:02:30.880> I'll

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
in it for the swing arm and then I'll

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.370 
in it for the swing arm and then I'll
take<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.390> along<00:02:31.600> here<00:02:34.530> somewhere

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:03:07.890 

so<00:02:41.380> far<00:02:41.620> however<00:02:41.800> routed<00:02:42.459> it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.679 

as<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.049> can<00:03:09.200> see<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.879> in<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> process<00:03:11.569> of

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
as you can see we just in the process of

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.740 
as you can see we just in the process of
Prime<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.849> moment<00:03:14.239> it's<00:03:14.359> taking<00:03:14.689> a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
Prime in the the moment it's taking a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:30.080 
Prime in the the moment it's taking a
while<00:03:18.489> getting<00:03:19.489> there<00:03:19.670> slowly

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.390 

and<00:03:31.090> that's<00:03:31.300> my<00:03:31.570> route<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.770> video<00:03:36.040> shows

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
and that's my route on the video shows

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.070 
and that's my route on the video shows
it<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.790> underneath<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.270> swingarm<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.840> can't

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
it going underneath the swingarm I can't
