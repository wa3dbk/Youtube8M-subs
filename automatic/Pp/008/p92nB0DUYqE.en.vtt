up a savings account if you don't
already<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.200> people

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
already have one I know that some people

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
main things I would say like I try to

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.410 
main things I would say like I try to
add<00:03:21.200> up<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.709> get<00:03:21.980> an<00:03:22.459> idea<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.940> how<00:03:23.150> much<00:03:23.269> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
add up and get an idea of how much I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.540 
add up and get an idea of how much I
would<00:03:23.540> be<00:03:23.570> paying<00:03:23.840> for<00:03:23.930> all<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:25.400> when

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
would be paying for all of that so when

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.060 
would be paying for all of that so when
you<00:03:25.670> make<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:26.180> list<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.590> add<00:03:27.769> it<00:03:27.950> up

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
you make a list of that you add it up

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.979 
you make a list of that you add it up
and<00:03:28.220> get<00:03:28.610> an<00:03:28.730> estimate<00:03:29.300> of<00:03:29.360> what<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.690> might<00:03:29.870> be

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
and get an estimate of what you might be

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.570 
and get an estimate of what you might be
looking<00:03:30.260> at<00:03:30.350> each<00:03:30.530> month<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.250> will<00:03:31.400> make

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
looking at each month and that will make

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
looking at each month and that will make
it<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.790> lot<00:03:31.970> clearer<00:03:32.360> for<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.350> see<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:33.590> you

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
it a lot clearer for you to see if you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.350 
it a lot clearer for you to see if you
can<00:03:33.830> afford<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.160> move<00:03:34.340> out<00:03:34.459> or<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.940> see<00:03:35.120> what

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
can afford to move out or to see what

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.290 
can afford to move out or to see what
you<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.930> save<00:03:36.560> up<00:03:36.739> in<00:03:36.950> order<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.700> be<00:03:38.239> able

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
you have to save up in order to be able

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.060 
you have to save up in order to be able
to<00:03:38.420> pay<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.570> everyone<00:03:39.050> tip<00:03:39.590> number<00:03:39.739> five<00:03:40.040> is

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
to pay that everyone tip number five is

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.130 
to pay that everyone tip number five is
what<00:03:40.549> helped<00:03:40.850> me<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> most<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.600> would<00:03:41.780> say<00:03:41.930> and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
what helped me the most I would say and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.960 
what helped me the most I would say and
that<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.650> live<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.340> already<00:03:43.610> moved

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
that is to live like you already moved

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.930 
that is to live like you already moved
out<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:44.959> what<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.230> started<00:03:45.410> doing<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.340> few<00:03:46.640> months

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
out so what I started doing a few months

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.410 
out so what I started doing a few months
before<00:03:47.120> moving<00:03:47.510> out<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:48.190> starting<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.580> put<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
before moving out is starting to put the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.060 
before moving out is starting to put the
money<00:03:50.600> aside<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> would<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.680> pay<00:03:51.860> for

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
money aside that I would have to pay for

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.190 
money aside that I would have to pay for
my<00:03:52.190> rent<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.640> other<00:03:52.730> expenses<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.510> would<00:03:54.019> put

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
my rent and other expenses I would put

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.800 
my rent and other expenses I would put
that<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:54.530> my<00:03:54.650> savings<00:03:54.950> account<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:56.180> felt<00:03:56.570> to

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
that in my savings account so it felt to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.300 
that in my savings account so it felt to
me<00:03:56.840> like<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.260> was<00:03:57.410> already<00:03:57.620> paying<00:03:57.950> for<00:03:58.160> rent
