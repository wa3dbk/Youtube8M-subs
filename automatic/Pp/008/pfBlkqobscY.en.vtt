it<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.380> course<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.830> helps<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.400> maintain

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it then of course it helps it maintain

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.910 
it then of course it helps it maintain
this<00:02:26.360> color<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.140> I'm<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.620> place

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this color so I'm just going to place

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.650 
this color so I'm just going to place
these<00:02:28.190> into<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:33.310> tray<00:02:34.310> here<00:02:34.730> there's<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.270> mesh

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
these into the tray here there's a mesh

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.210 
these into the tray here there's a mesh
and<00:02:36.050> leave<00:02:36.560> them<00:02:36.739> down<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.280> quickly<00:02:37.940> and

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
and leave them down here quickly and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.100 
and leave them down here quickly and
play<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:40.280> sort<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.820> in<00:02:41.000> some<00:02:41.270> type<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.510> order

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
play some sort of in some type of order

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.280 
play some sort of in some type of order
and<00:02:42.350> not<00:02:43.070> too<00:02:43.310> close<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:44.480> each<00:02:44.510> other<00:02:44.840> because

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and not too close to each other because

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.630 
and not too close to each other because
you<00:02:45.590> want<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.800> make<00:02:45.950> sure<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.610> air<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:48.650> coming

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
you want to make sure that air is coming

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.770 
you want to make sure that air is coming
through<00:02:49.970> very<00:02:50.360> clearly<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.350> mean<00:02:51.680> very<00:02:52.780> you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
through very clearly I mean very you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.009 
through very clearly I mean very you
know<00:02:53.810> very<00:02:53.930> well<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:56.570> pass

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
know very well so that I can pass

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.400 
know very well so that I can pass
through<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.830> heat<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.340> evenly<00:02:59.080> dry<00:03:00.080> them

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
through and the heat can evenly dry them

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.949 
through and the heat can evenly dry them
now<00:03:00.680> some<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.010> them<00:03:01.160> are<00:03:01.430> a<00:03:01.820> little<00:03:02.060> bit<00:03:02.450> larger

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
now some of them are a little bit larger

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.100 
now some of them are a little bit larger
that's<00:03:03.830> all<00:03:04.070> right<00:03:04.310> because<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:05.600> know<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.840> like

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
that's all right because you know I like

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.560 
that's all right because you know I like
I<00:03:06.350> don't<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.160> them<00:03:07.430> too<00:03:07.670> thin<00:03:07.910> especially<00:03:08.420> my

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
I don't like them too thin especially my

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.500 
I don't like them too thin especially my
fruits<00:03:08.900> when<00:03:09.140> they<00:03:09.260> are<00:03:09.760> dehydrated<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.000> these

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
fruits when they are dehydrated so these

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.590 
fruits when they are dehydrated so these
are<00:03:11.810> white<00:03:12.140> peaches<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> season

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
are white peaches and this is a season

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.300 
are white peaches and this is a season
for<00:03:14.780> peaches<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.470> may<00:03:15.650> be<00:03:15.709> one<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.070> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
for peaches so this may be one of the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.560 
for peaches so this may be one of the
things<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.209> can<00:03:17.390> do<00:03:17.630> as<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.790> summer<00:03:20.180> is

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
things that you can do as this summer is

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.120 
things that you can do as this summer is
to<00:03:20.959> simply<00:03:21.610> dehydrate<00:03:22.720> any<00:03:23.720> left<00:03:24.200> over<00:03:24.680> fruits

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
to simply dehydrate any left over fruits

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.300 
to simply dehydrate any left over fruits
that<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.489> have<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.049> your<00:03:27.049> children<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:28.040> eat

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
that you have and your children can eat

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.009 
that you have and your children can eat
them<00:03:28.549> instead<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:28.970> eating<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.720> sweet

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
them instead of eating a lot of sweet

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.170 
them instead of eating a lot of sweet
and<00:03:30.370> hopefully<00:03:31.370> now<00:03:31.549> these<00:03:31.730> features<00:03:32.150> are

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
and hopefully now these features are

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.670 
and hopefully now these features are
very<00:03:32.690> very<00:03:32.959> sweet<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:34.130> hopefully<00:03:34.790> when<00:03:35.060> they

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
very very sweet but hopefully when they

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.160 
very very sweet but hopefully when they
dry<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.709> when<00:03:37.220> they<00:03:37.340> dehydrate<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:38.329> lot<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.079> a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
dry out when they dehydrate a lot of a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.930 
dry out when they dehydrate a lot of a
concentration<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.640> sweet<00:03:41.030> will<00:03:42.579> be<00:03:43.579> there

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
concentration of the sweet will be there

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.470 
concentration of the sweet will be there
and<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:44.540> will<00:03:44.720> taste<00:03:44.959> even<00:03:45.320> better<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.910> this

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
and they will taste even better so this

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.650 
and they will taste even better so this
is<00:03:47.510> what<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.110> look<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.360> after<00:03:50.360> they

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
is what they look like and after they

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.229 
is what they look like and after they
dehydrate<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:51.590> about<00:03:51.769> 9<00:03:52.010> to<00:03:52.160> 12<00:03:52.370> hours<00:03:52.579> then

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
dehydrate for about 9 to 12 hours then

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.030 
dehydrate for about 9 to 12 hours then
of<00:03:53.360> course<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.690> will<00:03:53.780> come<00:03:54.049> back<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.500> then<00:03:54.860> I

this case now Abrams is a cross between

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.170 
this case now Abrams is a cross between
apricots<00:04:41.199> and<00:04:41.470> plums<00:04:42.039> and<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:43.539> therefore<00:04:45.180> you

and I'm going to cut them up I'm going
to<00:04:59.740> place<00:05:00.010> them<00:05:00.340> into<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:02.229> already<00:05:03.100> prepared

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
to place them into this already prepared

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.219 
to place them into this already prepared
solution<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:05.520> lemon<00:05:06.520> juice<00:05:06.870> place<00:05:07.870> them<00:05:08.110> in

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
solution of lemon juice place them in

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.450 
solution of lemon juice place them in
here<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.530> take<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.949> see<00:05:12.160> how<00:05:12.400> to

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
here and go to take to see how to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.330 
here and go to take to see how to
deceive<00:05:12.699> them<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:15.630> place<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.810> in<00:05:16.930> there<00:05:17.340> have

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
deceive them and place it in there have

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.490 
deceive them and place it in there have
we<00:05:18.460> were<00:05:18.639> maintained<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.419> color<00:05:19.780> here<00:05:20.169> and

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
we were maintained the color here and

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.430 
we were maintained the color here and
then<00:05:21.430> I'm<00:05:21.580> going<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:21.970> place<00:05:22.210> them<00:05:22.479> into<00:05:22.660> this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
then I'm going to place them into this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.870 
then I'm going to place them into this
tree<00:05:23.849> very<00:05:24.849> easy<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.539> do<00:05:25.919> let<00:05:26.919> me<00:05:27.010> DC<00:05:27.520> them<00:05:27.760> you

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
tree very easy to do let me DC them you

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.540 
tree very easy to do let me DC them you
can<00:05:28.030> just<00:05:28.180> sort<00:05:28.389> of<00:05:28.479> doing<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.840> like<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.550> of

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
can just sort of doing it like that of

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.120 
can just sort of doing it like that of
course<00:05:30.990> because<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.199> put<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.500> in<00:05:32.620> there<00:05:32.860> it's

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
course because it's put it in there it's

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.920 
course because it's put it in there it's
not<00:05:33.370> doing<00:05:33.669> as<00:05:33.789> well<00:05:33.820> but<00:05:35.610> anyway<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.669> can<00:05:37.000> do

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
not doing as well but anyway you can do

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.689 
not doing as well but anyway you can do
this<00:05:38.110> I<00:05:38.320> could<00:05:38.530> have<00:05:38.620> prepared<00:05:38.800> this<00:05:39.250> before

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
this I could have prepared this before

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.430 
this I could have prepared this before
but<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.240> just<00:05:40.449> want<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.720> let<00:05:40.810> you<00:05:41.020> see<00:05:41.410> your

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
but I just want to let you see your

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.950 
but I just want to let you see your
supervision<00:05:42.099> they're<00:05:42.520> sort<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.389> put<00:05:43.660> them<00:05:43.810> in

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
supervision they're sort of put them in

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.250 
supervision they're sort of put them in
that<00:05:44.669> solution<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:46.120> lemon<00:05:46.750> juice<00:05:46.780> and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
that solution of lemon juice and

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.350 
that solution of lemon juice and
remember<00:05:47.530> the<00:05:47.650> lemon<00:05:47.949> juice<00:05:47.979> have<00:05:48.370> to<00:05:48.520> retain

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
remember the lemon juice have to retain

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.270 
remember the lemon juice have to retain
their<00:05:49.599> color<00:05:49.630> make<00:05:50.410> sure<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:50.949> don't<00:05:51.070> get

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
their color make sure that you don't get

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.129 
their color make sure that you don't get
too<00:05:51.699> much<00:05:51.910> of<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.150> lemon<00:05:52.330> juice<00:05:52.479> in<00:05:52.870> here<00:05:53.020> it

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
too much of the lemon juice in here it

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.939 
too much of the lemon juice in here it
has<00:05:53.289> to<00:05:53.410> be<00:05:53.500> very<00:05:53.970> diluted<00:05:54.970> mouth<00:05:55.740> put<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.889> in

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
has to be very diluted mouth put that in

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.189 
has to be very diluted mouth put that in
there<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.550> then<00:05:58.360> of<00:05:58.479> course<00:05:58.539> some<00:05:58.990> of<00:05:59.020> these

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
there and then of course some of these

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.670 
there and then of course some of these
are<00:05:59.440> very<00:05:59.740> very<00:06:00.070> right<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:01.470> so<00:06:02.470> it's<00:06:02.770> hard<00:06:03.039> to

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
are very very right and so it's hard to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.790 
are very very right and so it's hard to
get<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:05.860> seed<00:06:06.159> to<00:06:06.520> come<00:06:07.030> out<00:06:07.349> unless<00:06:08.349> you

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
get the seed to come out unless you

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.600 
get the seed to come out unless you
squash<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:09.430> all<00:06:09.610> up<00:06:10.020> okay<00:06:11.020> but<00:06:11.080> anyway<00:06:11.590> this<00:06:12.370> is

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
squash it all up okay but anyway this is

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.200 
squash it all up okay but anyway this is
one<00:06:12.820> way<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:13.539> can<00:06:14.400> prepare<00:06:15.400> some<00:06:16.090> of

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
one way that you can prepare some of

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.610 
one way that you can prepare some of
your<00:06:16.360> left<00:06:16.630> over<00:06:18.389> fruit<00:06:19.389> for<00:06:19.900> your<00:06:20.080> children

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
your left over fruit for your children

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.140 
your left over fruit for your children
children<00:06:21.099> do<00:06:21.280> like<00:06:21.570> dehydrated

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
children do like dehydrated

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.690 
children do like dehydrated
fruits<00:06:23.870> because<00:06:24.170> they're<00:06:24.740> very<00:06:25.040> very<00:06:25.220> sweet

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
fruits because they're very very sweet

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.000 
fruits because they're very very sweet
because<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.720> nutrients<00:06:27.260> are<00:06:27.440> very<00:06:27.770> very

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
because the nutrients are very very

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.640 
because the nutrients are very very
concentrated<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.690> since<00:06:29.990> these<00:06:30.200> features

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
concentrated and so since these features

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.440 
concentrated and so since these features
were<00:06:30.860> not<00:06:31.130> they're<00:06:31.580> not<00:06:31.610> peaches<00:06:32.030> with<00:06:32.330> their

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
were not they're not peaches with their

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.290 
were not they're not peaches with their
apricots<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:33.200> clumps<00:06:34.070> since<00:06:34.610> they<00:06:34.760> were<00:06:35.030> not

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
apricots and clumps since they were not

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.720 
apricots and clumps since they were not
best<00:06:35.570> sweet<00:06:35.990> well<00:06:36.560> they<00:06:36.800> made<00:06:37.070> once<00:06:37.490> the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
best sweet well they made once the

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.220 
best sweet well they made once the
nutrients<00:06:39.790> once<00:06:40.790> it<00:06:40.970> dries<00:06:41.210> out<00:06:41.450> then<00:06:42.080> of

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:42.230 
nutrients once it dries out then of

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.390 
nutrients once it dries out then of
course<00:06:42.470> the<00:06:42.650> nutrients<00:06:43.070> may<00:06:43.220> have

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
course the nutrients may have

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.100 
course the nutrients may have
concentrated<00:06:44.000> there<00:06:44.270> may<00:06:44.360> be<00:06:44.390> a<00:06:44.510> lot<00:06:44.750> sweeter

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
concentrated there may be a lot sweeter

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.820 
concentrated there may be a lot sweeter
than<00:06:45.940> what<00:06:46.940> they<00:06:47.090> are<00:06:47.270> now<00:06:47.390> but<00:06:48.380> in<00:06:48.560> a<00:06:48.590> way<00:06:48.800> this
