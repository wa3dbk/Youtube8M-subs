prominent<00:02:44.730> temple<00:02:45.730> muscle<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:46.270> which<00:02:46.390> is

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
prominent temple muscle here which is

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.130 
prominent temple muscle here which is
called<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> temporalis<00:02:47.470> temporalis<00:02:48.190> muscle

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
called the temporalis temporalis muscle

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.500 
called the temporalis temporalis muscle
the<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:51.130> muscle<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.490> often<00:02:51.790> treated<00:02:52.150> as<00:02:52.330> well

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the this muscle is often treated as well

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.020 
the this muscle is often treated as well
in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.050> case<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.440> people<00:02:53.740> who<00:02:53.800> have<00:02:54.030> migraines

in the case of people who have migraines

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.450 
in the case of people who have migraines
or<00:02:55.180> headaches<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.590> can<00:02:56.770> often<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> cause

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
or headaches this can often be a cause

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.390 
or headaches this can often be a cause
of<00:02:57.490> those<00:02:58.090> headaches<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> but<00:02:59.890> today<00:03:00.100> we'll<00:03:00.280> be

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
of those headaches so but today we'll be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.970 
of those headaches so but today we'll be
focusing<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.630> masseter<00:03:02.470> muscle<00:03:02.890> the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
focusing on the masseter muscle the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.160 
focusing on the masseter muscle the
muscle<00:03:03.100> here<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.210> first<00:03:04.390> step<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.960> mark

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
muscle here so the first step is to mark

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:14.130 
muscle here so the first step is to mark
out<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.560> muscle<00:03:05.890> Thank<00:03:06.760> You<00:03:06.850> Dean

and again and I'm just going to put in a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.720 
and again and I'm just going to put in a
few<00:03:17.500> dots<00:03:18.060> where<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.570> muscle<00:03:19.990> is<00:03:20.730> quite

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
few dots where the muscle is quite

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.350 
few dots where the muscle is quite
strong

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.850 

and<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.080> other<00:03:25.200> side<00:03:25.880> entity

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.280 

interesting<00:03:30.790> Lee<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.060> side<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:31.810> not<00:03:32.020> quite

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
interesting Lee this side it's not quite

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.150 
interesting Lee this side it's not quite
as<00:03:32.440> powerful<00:03:32.880> as<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.090> other<00:03:35.040> now<00:03:36.040> it's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
as powerful as the other now it's

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.100 
as powerful as the other now it's
important<00:03:36.550> also<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:37.150> when<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.750> place<00:03:37.960> these

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
important also that when you place these

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.010 
important also that when you place these
injections<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:39.460> we<00:03:39.910> then<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.480> don't<00:03:40.750> actually

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
injections that we then I don't actually

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.010 
injections that we then I don't actually
go<00:03:41.200> into<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.220> muscle<00:03:42.550> which<00:03:42.760> costs<00:03:43.600> or<00:03:43.720> smile

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
go into the muscle which costs or smile

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.990 
go into the muscle which costs or smile
so<00:03:44.230> here's<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.530> smile<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:45.010> Michelle<00:03:45.280> there's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
so here's a smile that Michelle there's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.520 
so here's a smile that Michelle there's
a<00:03:46.090> muscle<00:03:46.300> which<00:03:46.540> goes<00:03:46.780> from<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> core<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.410> the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
a muscle which goes from the core of the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.680 
a muscle which goes from the core of the
man<00:03:47.710> up<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:49.050> back<00:03:50.050> here<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:51.000> if<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.270> muscles

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
man up to back here and if this muscles

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.270 
man up to back here and if this muscles
hit<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.200> may<00:03:53.320> get<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.560> bit<00:03:53.740> of<00:03:53.860> droop<00:03:54.130> in

that can be covered with a bit of

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.680 
that can be covered with a bit of
concealer<00:05:10.500> I'll<00:05:10.710> make<00:05:10.830> up<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.789> results<00:05:12.599> from

concealer I'll make up the results from

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.999 
concealer I'll make up the results from
the<00:05:12.840> procedure<00:05:13.229> actually<00:05:13.409> took<00:05:13.590> about<00:05:13.650> two

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
the procedure actually took about two

the procedure actually took about two
months<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.360> work<00:05:15.409> unlike<00:05:16.409> other<00:05:16.650> parts<00:05:16.889> of<00:05:17.069> the

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
months to work unlike other parts of the

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.790 
months to work unlike other parts of the
face<00:05:17.340> where<00:05:17.849> we<00:05:18.000> use<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.300> product<00:05:19.110> usually

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
face where we use this product usually

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.980 
face where we use this product usually
takes<00:05:20.069> two<00:05:20.220> weeks<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.580> work<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.720> what

takes two weeks to work and what

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.399 
takes two weeks to work and what
Michelle<00:05:22.319> notice<00:05:22.710> is<00:05:23.419> reduced<00:05:24.419> box<00:05:24.659> in<00:05:25.080> the

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
Michelle notice is reduced box in the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.770 
Michelle notice is reduced box in the
sides<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.800> her<00:05:25.889> face<00:05:26.099> and<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:27.090> slimming<00:05:27.479> the

sides of her face and a slimming the
face<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.169> make<00:05:28.289> a<00:05:28.349> face<00:05:28.620> appear<00:05:28.949> more<00:05:29.069> like<00:05:29.250> an

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
face to make a face appear more like an

face to make a face appear more like an
upside<00:05:29.789> down<00:05:29.819> triangle<00:05:31.069> but<00:05:32.069> I<00:05:32.099> think<00:05:32.280> this

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
upside down triangle but I think this

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.770 
upside down triangle but I think this
would<00:05:32.550> be<00:05:32.580> quite<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.599> nice<00:05:34.190> change

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
would be quite a nice change

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.439 
would be quite a nice change
enhancer<00:05:36.780> cheeks<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:38.639> jawline<00:05:38.789> level<00:05:41.449> so

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
enhancer cheeks and the jawline level so

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.950 
enhancer cheeks and the jawline level so
in<00:05:43.110> summary<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:43.680> procedure<00:05:44.190> will<00:05:44.729> is<00:05:45.659> a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
in summary this procedure will is a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.129 
in summary this procedure will is a
relatively<00:05:46.860> quick<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.580> simple<00:05:47.789> procedure<00:05:48.300> it

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
relatively quick and simple procedure it

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.469 
relatively quick and simple procedure it
takes<00:05:49.740> it<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.129> month<00:05:50.520> or<00:05:50.639> two<00:05:50.759> to<00:05:50.789> work<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.330> it

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
takes it a month or two to work and it

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.689 
takes it a month or two to work and it
usually<00:05:51.750> lasts<00:05:52.169> for<00:05:52.349> around<00:05:52.440> six<00:05:52.949> months<00:05:53.129> or

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
usually lasts for around six months or

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.149 
usually lasts for around six months or
even<00:05:54.180> longer<00:05:54.330> in<00:05:54.629> some<00:05:54.810> cases<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.949> does

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
even longer in some cases but does

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.730 
even longer in some cases but does
require<00:05:56.430> periodic<00:05:56.909> retention<00:05:57.599> so<00:05:58.169> if<00:05:58.409> you<00:05:58.590> are

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
require periodic retention so if you are

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.769 
require periodic retention so if you are
looking<00:05:59.130> to<00:06:00.000> reduce<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:01.740> size<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.569> the<00:06:03.569> jaw

and improve the shape of the door this

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.839 
and improve the shape of the door this
is<00:06:06.509> a<00:06:06.569> good<00:06:06.750> non-surgical<00:06:07.529> procedure<00:06:07.860> which

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
is a good non-surgical procedure which

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.760 
is a good non-surgical procedure which
doesn't<00:06:09.180> require<00:06:09.270> any<00:06:09.870> cutting<00:06:10.139> or<00:06:10.469> stitching
