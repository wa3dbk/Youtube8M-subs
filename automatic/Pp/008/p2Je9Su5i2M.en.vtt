00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.650
 calmate name where we do not have and that and the bank that more 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.840
 but this is also giving different things 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.499
 thought energy the party very different from the president 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.909
 I have the right to ask myself 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.989
 in my opinion the particular thing does not seem bad to me but I wonder 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 Until when will it be sustainable? 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.089
 politically 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.989
 politically sustainable to metal cross 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.089
 and it will be like this I imagine that hector lescano 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.620
 until when politically sustainable that part difference 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.670
 because I believe that not only differences of opinion 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.290
 there are many champions 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.710
 will be determined by that of course shrunk entrepreneurs have stepped on 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.140
 here is something else 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.460
 it is not necessary that they are shared among the peoples in a report 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.620
 but we approach 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.800
 saving the differences and Muslims 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800
 we started to take the stage a bit completely 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.210
 ended presiding vicente fox in mexico 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.310
 if they are never presented 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.840
 without the agreement between his party and therefore he had consequences also in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.550
 the congress good such approval to safety and a good administrator 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.230
 but I would not call it toyota tacoma brand by 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.510
 comparisons 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.150
 but alicia I think it's that 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.159
 things are becoming clear at this time 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.010
 and one and another sitting in your life is almost almost nobody so I see it I feel that 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.810
 be good or bad more I'm not saying no to me it seems bad to allow 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.720
 this 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 I think that because of the fact, for example, the president has gone into the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.270
 high 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.950
 and will go to another who can from relationships 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.820
 by improving relations with the United States for example 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.590
 that is not going to not go to the fmln to a crisis nor will it lead to the fpl 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.700
 Leave 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.490
 we are 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.869
 his uses his susanatuas concerns of the three airports was making bulk 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.010
 Another way 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.219
 p for it 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.780
 vice president 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.290
 the Brazilian minister 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.479
 you can not you can not carry out some projects that you consider successful 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.789
 as the case of April when 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.469
 kiko tote min 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.999
 will end up giving up will be that the expert does not do anything 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.679
 11 and it's also in ministry policy that's why the consequences that 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.679
 we have the right to 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.459
 citizens allows us to analyze why the Afghan government and as I say 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.979
 there is nothing wrong with the strike for the same response as the vice president 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:28.999
 age 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.429
 I get the impression 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:35.159
 fish tank completely safe and convinced that in the end who decides the 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.839
 president's policy is fune and will enable the president's policy 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.949
 obama only six months 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.099
 while you want 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.049
 What do you want me to tell you what will happen after all that May? 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.799
 now let's analyze what has happened until today today until today things are like this 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.870
 it was up to today things are not crisis correspond it is as if I knew going to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.829
 take as you want as a community and epa to expel the president to the prison 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.290
 I also want to get the president to deny bulls joseph 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.030
 neighborhoods the fmln possibly happens 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.800
 possibly it happens to us that you see you get it but it can happen now is that javier 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.200
 efe i know how to say it - ecuador rafael regular strap just that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 it is simply the consequence to govern and the political system does not 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.220
 they only happen or want also in the revolt to value the proposal of 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330
 declare respect to those who lost this moment to promote life in 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.510
 this moment and that is why we can no longer analyze the consequences of difference 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.579
 these public companies and they do not seem 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.659
 enters the vice president introduced the republic 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:42.359
 it's the first time you heard that there were 93 percent eight medals in total 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.080
 for the Balearic player as well as job stability 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.710
 I want to go back to penetrate the proposal of the pp that you think that within 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.600
 six months of descent more appreciable to my country but I say no but at 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.350
 just like Aragon is the third edition of the concert price correction 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 cement base and castle claramunt there was a lot of distance 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.779
 and even though it ended 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.899
 taking it out any public position 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.929
 between the president cristian 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.889
 i eat and not 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.759
 there were also differences 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.169
 specifically at the close of yesterday the president flowers 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.409
 iii also the doctors there was quite a difference 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.419
 the problem gets worse in what the money that the time to fix differences 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.279
 adj in jump 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.149
 in direct ixtepec city in which the vice president did not represent the 

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:32.699
 match 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.270
 does not represent the party I wonder is only a problem difference with 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.090
 your vice president that is solved 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.620
 good this case the expensive cardinal as a man older than he is 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.020
 with the clear party that is to return to see the vice president 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.569
 is that there are only four assets 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.360
 They dare their position and I think the per 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.350
 clear clear match clear that the political commission I do not say but the 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.789
 reality is that he is wishing that this is not something more than a fashion was made 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:58.500
 wait 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 we'll see 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 China 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.529
 peace we have feelings of the industries of the word manuel molÃ©s 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:23.100
 humility 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.260
 is that I think these important 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
 for example in an attempt to flee with his destiny 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.059
 this government 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.059
 these are fundamental steps 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.460
 the second doubt 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.750
 a government every government has to have unity and action nonsense and 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.789
 strategic 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.160
 I do not know why it does not look good to have 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.460
 if then on material safety 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.500
 education 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.509
 the labor ministry 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.199
 both are few 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.439
 I do not understand why you leave or unions 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.080
 these highlighted in his speech 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.659
 the ideology the fmln unions 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.080
 1 the common work momo the bell that the state contributes as 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.239
 intruder the union stec-ic los oscar 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.330
 get all the shorts and have a style of their own that by force 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.029
 this 15 of the 20 percent 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:27.659
 these are just that because all of you expressed oviedo party concluded a 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.719
 Jewish government party 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:34.860
 the socialism of the 21st century what signs two entries and harvest of socialism 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.919
 of the 21st century 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.490
 what is that 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.849
 is that they are important decisions 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:46.319
 a serious government of truth but are a unit of actions my purpose 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.069
 and if we have a president 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.999
 who says that it goes public look at that educational reform I already knew them 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.460
 and that commission is illegal 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.379
 some versions in Portuguese 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.560
 and pakistan but saw it as the best that has valued the agreement that still 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.289
 can be generated topic with honors that looks 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.169
 the one that I believe where the unit that worries you voice may be between the 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:14.099
 government and the party 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.290
 is the program 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.050
 I think that while 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.760
 President
