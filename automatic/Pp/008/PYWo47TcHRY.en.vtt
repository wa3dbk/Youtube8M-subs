00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.900
 effectively sporting crystal in his 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.750
 second friendly match that is being 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.339
 developing in montevideo uruguay 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 lost in a scandalous way 3 to 0 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.630
 against the national set failing 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 a penalty through clear sighting 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 a not very good presentation of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.349
 sporting crystal I had won by 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.210
 by pitches of penalties at vélez in 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.630
 his first match but now he lost 3 to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 0 that is, if we continue with these results 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 in Peruvian soccer we are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.720
 doomed to look at the big 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.520
 powers of distance and eye that a 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.260
 crystal comes the liberators cup 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 that is, it is a crystal that has to play 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.970
 against athletic paranaense a team 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.950
 Brazilian with aspirations to get into 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.590
 the university group of the own 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.880
 vélez and the Bolivian team 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 that 's the stranger's way I do not 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.660
 would scandalize the subject of the win 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.010
 of this analyze with nothing to go in 6 if 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.170
 it's quiet puts him in 10 and the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.580
 quiet block of yesterday occupies the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 working and will appreciate 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.670
 working 3 to know how is the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.140
 team facing what the company 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.880
 libertarian of america because this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 they are basically matches 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 the preseason you can get 4 te 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 can get in and react that our 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.860
 companies agree that last year role 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.180
 and this was the winner of this 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.340
 quadrangular as it was in the cup 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 liberators of america was eliminated in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.049
 the first in the group stage that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.759
 the fact of winning did not come out 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.439
 guarantee you have a good cup 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.850
 liberators for me the most important thing 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 is the operation is how are the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.640
 lines as it is coupling the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 players because this is a new 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.479
 process for the glass bearing is fine 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.369
 but there's going to be where 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.929
 crystal has worked and you do not give it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.250
 importance to the result and makes 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.420
 importance to the operation of that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 working of which you liked 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.039
 good what we are all addressing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.289
 this crystal shows better 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.929
 defensively that last year because 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.610
 the previous season generated great 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.380
 doubts because crystal was a thing of the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.939
 half forward and one half 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.740
 backwards they were not horrible 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.599
 central defenses but it's a problem 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 not only glass is a problem of the 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.869
 selection is a water problem is a 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.060
 problem of the alliance that something 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.209
 corrected with ibáñez is a problem of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 almost all Peruvian teams have 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.819
 rejector is and there 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.619
 people who keep asking rejectionist is 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.959
 that sends a rejected 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.000
 talking about rejector is one of the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.069
 goals that you do not like that you had 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.230
 Ojeriza was there is no longer there 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.390
 hired to the wine they put 3 to 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.489
 crystal that is the reality they thrashed it 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290
 to the crystal but what I'm going is how it goes 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.840
 to work that defensive part if 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.150
 you have to link has left tumors of 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.580
 selection you have experienced trees 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.709
 has to leave what's important is going to be how 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 they are defensively conditioned that 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.180
 they are going to make mistakes it is true but 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.310
 the best we do not have much space to 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 the comment because the images a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.329
 little that we have had difficulties for 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 appreciate it but what we have been able to 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.630
 it affects you to listen on the subject of 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.160
 transmissions is that this is short and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.230
 list genres few goal situations 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.500
 there if my concern comes because 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.660
 we talk about players like this one ávila 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.130
 for example now it's like catolus 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.930
 elements that could be generated 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.549
 imbalances however crystal 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.709
 generated little in function of attack 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.030
 that to me particularly worries me 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.290
 because the first game that is what 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.629
 Best local and that you have to 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.470
 do you have to propose crystal surcharge 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.660
 I killed you with the possession of the ball 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 giving the ball that when we were that 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.800
 was now another coach remember 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.930
 why do not you suddenly come to me 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.420
 restrain what everyone is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 saying the style does not what happens what 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.480
 happens that they brought out a treaty in the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.760
 crystal this is the crystal style 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.950
 but the style of a team is not worth 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.740
 a role the team style go from 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.930
 the court with the sensitivity let's say 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.910
 with the technique that can have 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.980
 colors made and not words made and not 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.750
 words or be a technical group to win 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.750
 nice but if your team does not speak in the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.070
 court if you do not know what he plays 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.740
 It really is a problem but crystal is not 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.300
 has a long time Ricardo is true the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.990
 Accumulated work of the sporting crystal 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.490
 had a stumble bounced with a wall of 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.490
 that this quadrangular especially in the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.160
 last game but he has time for 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.840
 arm yourself to believe in this again 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.459
 people can change crystal with the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.680
 presence of the cane that its better so 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.720
 least for the middle of hierarchy and that 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.520
 has an interesting journey that 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.680
 can allow you to sporting glass at 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.480
 we better have the ball deal that 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.130
 so much we wait and up it seems to me that 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.440
 leguizamón weapons that is an element 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.120
 of enough travel what of Núñez and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.240
 ávila to which the technician I am giving 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.770
 the confidence to play as forward 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.390
 accompanied by leguizamón but this 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.610
 crystal will have to work pretty 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.380
 - more from low to an athletic to 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.940
 times that does not have too many 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.500
 matches over every this match of 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.570
 cup freed anyway is the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.430
 respect to a Brazilian team that has 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.900
 much physical that scares you because they are 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.760
 accomplishments much tactical discipline 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.500
 It does not scare me or your face dwells like 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.880
 consultation with the Paranaense team 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
 I want to give me that impression I tell you 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.150
 Brazil and you start to tremble is a 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:56.630
 respect I have nothing and I do not have parkinson 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.630
 and
