hey this course we have crazy users calm
in<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> US<00:00:11.070> tech<00:00:11.340> channel<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.880> today<00:00:11.969> I'm

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
in the US tech channel and today I'm

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.580 
in the US tech channel and today I'm
going<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> test<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> strength<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> DNA

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
going to test the strength of the DNA

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.640 
going to test the strength of the DNA
against<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> drill<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:15.240> just<00:00:15.360> kidding<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
against a drill I'm just kidding the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.320 
against a drill I'm just kidding the
great<00:00:16.980> thing<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.490> DNA<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> has

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
great thing about the DNA is that it has

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.170 
great thing about the DNA is that it has
a<00:00:18.359> notification<00:00:19.369> hole<00:00:20.369> guy<00:00:20.550> does<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
a notification hole guy does not be

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.340 
a notification hole guy does not be
great<00:00:21.420> thing<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
great thing about it but one of the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.810 
great thing about it but one of the
features<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.160> notification<00:00:23.810> LED<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
features is a notification LED on the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.939 
features is a notification LED on the
backside<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.390> most<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> cases<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.349> came

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
backside but most of the cases that came

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.730 
backside but most of the cases that came
out<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.400> device<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:30.420> choose<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.170> chose

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
out for this device they choose a chose

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.880 
out for this device they choose a chose
to<00:00:32.369> ignore<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.850> fact<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.860> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to ignore that fact so I'm going to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.119 
to ignore that fact so I'm going to
drill<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.489> notification<00:00:36.530> hole<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
drill a little notification hole in the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
drill a little notification hole in the
back<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.930> right<00:00:39.960> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
back of it you can see right there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.010 
back of it you can see right there
there's<00:00:40.590> our<00:00:40.710> notification<00:00:41.399> LED<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.870> not

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
there's our notification LED it's not

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
there's our notification LED it's not
blinking<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> where

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
blinking right now but that is where

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.690 
blinking right now but that is where
it's<00:00:45.149> located<00:00:45.739> pretty<00:00:46.739> much<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.070> i<00:00:47.129> did<00:00:47.460> was

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it's located pretty much what i did was

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.200 
it's located pretty much what i did was
measure<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.570> real<00:00:48.809> quick<00:00:48.870> i<00:00:49.440> used<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
measure this out real quick i used a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.779 
measure this out real quick i used a
nickel<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.590> from<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> center<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> camera

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
nickel and from the center of the camera

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.569 
nickel and from the center of the camera
hole<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:55.050> about<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> center<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
hole to about the center of that

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.540 
hole to about the center of that
notification<00:00:57.390> LED<00:00:57.930> hole<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
notification LED hole is like the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.700 
notification LED hole is like the
distance<00:00:59.760> between<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.780> united<00:01:01.500> states

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
distance between the the united states

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
distance between the the united states
of<00:01:01.770> america<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.840> i<00:01:03.899> just

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
made those markings on the silicone

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.109 
made those markings on the silicone
piece<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> plastic<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> outside<00:01:11.430> i'm

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
piece and the plastic on the outside i'm

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
piece and the plastic on the outside i'm
going<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.080> kind<00:01:13.470> drill<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
going to use this to kind drill like a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.620 
going to use this to kind drill like a
little<00:01:14.490> pilot<00:01:14.880> hole<00:01:15.210> real<00:01:15.540> quick<00:01:17.299> then<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
little pilot hole real quick then just a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.550 
little pilot hole real quick then just a
little<00:01:18.659> pressure<00:01:19.170> i<00:01:20.570> letting<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.869> pit<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.350> its

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
little pressure i letting the pit do its

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.420 
little pressure i letting the pit do its
thing

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.480 

clean<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.420> bowl<00:01:29.840> right<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:32.920> let's<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.190> let's

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
clean that bowl right up let's see let's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.210 
clean that bowl right up let's see let's
go<00:01:34.640> ahead<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.290> do<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.410> same<00:01:36.680> thing<00:01:36.980> with<00:01:37.190> the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
go ahead and do the same thing with the

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.010 
go ahead and do the same thing with the
outer<00:01:37.930> shell<00:01:40.090> made<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> little<00:01:42.670> mark<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
outer shell made a little mark in the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.200 
outer shell made a little mark in the
plastic<00:01:47.380> right<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.790> go<00:01:49.790> ahead<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.090> put

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
plastic right there go ahead and put

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.890 
plastic right there go ahead and put
some<00:01:50.330> pressure<00:01:50.630> on<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.330> I'm<00:01:59.540> going<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.750> want

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
some pressure on it so I'm going to want

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.240 
some pressure on it so I'm going to want
that<00:02:00.050> hole<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.410> be<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.560> little<00:02:00.740> bit<00:02:00.890> bigger<00:02:01.070> than

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that hole to be a little bit bigger than

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.070 
that hole to be a little bit bigger than
that<00:02:01.340> as<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.330> can<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.720> might<00:02:02.840> have<00:02:02.990> to

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
that as you can see you might have to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.770 
that as you can see you might have to
come<00:02:03.290> back<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.800> clean<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.000> whole<00:02:05.420> up<00:02:05.720> as<00:02:05.960> well

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.970 

I'll<00:02:11.780> probably<00:02:11.900> make<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.260> whole<00:02:12.680> about<00:02:12.950> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
I'll probably make this whole about a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.430 
I'll probably make this whole about a
quarter<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.940> an<00:02:14.090> inch<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.540> think<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.050> low

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
quarter of an inch I think that's as low

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.670 
quarter of an inch I think that's as low
as<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.709> one<00:02:16.270> goes<00:02:17.270> right<00:02:17.600> here<00:02:17.630> actually<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
as this one goes right here actually it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
as this one goes right here actually it
might<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:18.920> three<00:02:19.070> quarters<00:02:19.430> might<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
might be three quarters might be a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.390 
might be three quarters might be a
little<00:02:19.820> bit<00:02:19.970> bigger<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.330> that's<00:02:21.050> okay<00:02:21.400> oman

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
little bit bigger but that's okay oman

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.510 
little bit bigger but that's okay oman
having<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.050> fat<00:02:24.050> hole<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.590> i'm<00:02:25.370> gonna

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
having a fat hole in there i'm gonna

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:35.039 
having a fat hole in there i'm gonna
drill<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> little<00:02:26.180> bit<00:02:26.540> bigger<00:02:26.750> boat

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.930 

go<00:02:36.049> ahead<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.350> do<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> with<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.040> as<00:02:37.220> well<00:02:37.250> i

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940

for<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:50.030> might<00:02:50.180> find<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.570> easier<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.959> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
for that you might find it easier on the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.789 
for that you might find it easier on the
silicon<00:02:51.500> part<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.780> go<00:02:53.780> ahead<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.019> cut<00:02:54.769> a

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
silicon part to just go ahead and cut a

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.259 
silicon part to just go ahead and cut a
big<00:02:55.040> hole<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.280> there<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:58.130> harder<00:02:58.280> part<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.790> cut

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
big hole in there the harder part to cut

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.940 
big hole in there the harder part to cut
out<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.630> might<00:02:59.720> look<00:02:59.900> a<00:03:00.019> little<00:03:00.170> bit<00:03:00.350> messy<00:03:00.769> I

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
out it might look a little bit messy I

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.920 
out it might look a little bit messy I
just<00:03:01.580> clean<00:03:01.790> it<00:03:01.820> up<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.570> best<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> your

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
just clean it up to the best of your

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.170 
just clean it up to the best of your
ability<00:03:03.519> probably<00:03:04.519> should<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.760> used<00:03:04.820> like<00:03:05.090> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
ability probably should have used like a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.240 
ability probably should have used like a
toenail<00:03:05.600> clipper<00:03:06.049> so<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:06.950> ahead<00:03:06.980> and

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
toenail clipper so you go ahead and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.479 
toenail clipper so you go ahead and
clean<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.209> up<00:03:08.410> make<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> circle<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.190> little

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
clean that up make the circle a little

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.509 
clean that up make the circle a little
bit<00:03:10.700> more<00:03:10.850> round<00:03:11.209> there<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.829> chose<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.370> keep

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
bit more round there but I chose to keep

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.710 
bit more round there but I chose to keep
the<00:03:13.730> hole<00:03:13.940> this<00:03:14.570> size<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:16.329> if<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.420> see<00:03:17.600> in

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the hole this size and if you see in

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.979 
the hole this size and if you see in
there<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.290> see<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> notification<00:03:19.340> LED

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
there you can see the notification LED

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.050 
there you can see the notification LED
so<00:03:20.989> that's<00:03:21.410> how<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.680> make<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.610> notification

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
so that's how you make a notification

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.740 
so that's how you make a notification
LED<00:03:23.540> hole<00:03:24.110> for<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.700> HTC<00:03:25.700> droid<00:03:26.090> DNA<00:03:26.120> with

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
LED hole for the HTC droid DNA with

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.170 
LED hole for the HTC droid DNA with
otterbox<00:03:27.049> commuter<00:03:27.799> case<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:29.000> more

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180
