good<00:00:26.620> to<00:00:26.800> harvest<00:00:27.220> your<00:00:27.310> bin<00:00:27.490> you're<00:00:28.000> gonna

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
good to harvest your bin you're gonna

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.720 
good to harvest your bin you're gonna
have<00:00:28.420> half<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:29.080> two-thirds<00:00:29.680> of<00:00:29.800> your<00:00:30.070> bin<00:00:30.280> full

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
have half to two-thirds of your bin full

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.720 
have half to two-thirds of your bin full
of<00:00:31.060> dark<00:00:31.480> rich<00:00:31.720> soil<00:00:32.110> at<00:00:32.829> that<00:00:33.100> point<00:00:33.399> it<00:00:33.610> is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
of dark rich soil at that point it is

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.459 
of dark rich soil at that point it is
really<00:00:34.149> important<00:00:34.570> to<00:00:34.600> separate<00:00:35.079> your<00:00:35.230> worms

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
really important to separate your worms

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.080 
really important to separate your worms
from<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.190> compost<00:00:36.550> they<00:00:36.760> have<00:00:36.880> created

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
from the compost they have created

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.810 
from the compost they have created
because<00:00:37.989> otherwise<00:00:38.410> leaving<00:00:39.190> your<00:00:39.340> worms<00:00:39.550> in

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
because otherwise leaving your worms in

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.479 
because otherwise leaving your worms in
finished<00:00:40.480> compost<00:00:40.870> for<00:00:41.140> too<00:00:41.350> long<00:00:41.560> could

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
finished compost for too long could

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.800 
finished compost for too long could
actually<00:00:42.640> lead<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.060> bit<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.390> toxic

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
actually lead to a bit of a toxic

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.450 
actually lead to a bit of a toxic
environment<00:00:43.870> for<00:00:44.410> them<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:44.890> it's<00:00:45.010> important

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
environment for them so it's important

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.580 
environment for them so it's important
to<00:00:45.489> get<00:00:46.149> rid<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.510> nice<00:00:47.050> completed

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
to get rid of that nice completed

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.490 
to get rid of that nice completed
compost<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.280> start<00:00:48.760> with<00:00:48.850> new<00:00:48.970> fresh<00:00:49.239> bedding

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
compost and start with new fresh bedding

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.610 
compost and start with new fresh bedding
close<00:00:50.500> up<00:00:50.649> of<00:00:50.739> this<00:00:50.920> bin<00:00:51.130> to<00:00:51.640> show<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:52.620> how

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
close up of this bin to show you how

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.830 
close up of this bin to show you how
this<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.460> over<00:00:54.700> half<00:00:54.940> full<00:00:55.239> this<00:00:55.450> is<00:00:55.510> nice

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
this is just over half full this is nice

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.510 
this is just over half full this is nice
rich<00:00:56.140> compost<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.950> is<00:00:57.040> ready<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.430> be

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
rich compost that is ready to be

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.319 
rich compost that is ready to be
harvested<00:00:59.010> so<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.160> really<00:01:00.309> important<00:01:00.790> to

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
harvested so it's really important to

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.330 
harvested so it's really important to
let<00:01:01.989> your<00:01:02.110> worms<00:01:02.350> kind<00:01:02.829> of<00:01:02.890> assist<00:01:03.160> in<00:01:03.280> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
let your worms kind of assist in the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.009 
let your worms kind of assist in the
process<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.910> separating<00:01:04.089> themselves<00:01:04.570> from

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
process of separating themselves from

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.529 
process of separating themselves from
the<00:01:05.829> compost<00:01:06.219> to<00:01:06.490> make<00:01:07.000> your<00:01:07.149> job<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:07.329> bit

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
the compost to make your job a bit

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.080 
the compost to make your job a bit
easier<00:01:07.899> a<00:01:08.109> great<00:01:08.590> way<00:01:08.709> to<00:01:08.740> do<00:01:09.009> that<00:01:09.039> is<00:01:09.579> to<00:01:09.909> not

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
easier a great way to do that is to not

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.940 
easier a great way to do that is to not
feed<00:01:10.389> them<00:01:10.509> for<00:01:10.780> three<00:01:11.049> weeks<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.469> row

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
feed them for three weeks in a row

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.770 
feed them for three weeks in a row

going to wait two to three weeks to

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.489 
going to wait two to three weeks to
allow<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.249> worms<00:01:30.609> to<00:01:31.270> migrate<00:01:31.719> over<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.079> that

allow the worms to migrate over to that

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.760 
allow the worms to migrate over to that
one<00:01:32.709> side<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:34.029> after<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.569> point<00:01:34.959> most<00:01:35.619> of

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
one side so after that point most of

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.249 
one side so after that point most of
them<00:01:35.889> will<00:01:36.069> be<00:01:36.219> on<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.849> fresh<00:01:37.090> side<00:01:37.329> and

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
them will be on the fresh side and

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.010 
them will be on the fresh side and
you're<00:01:38.380> then<00:01:38.590> able<00:01:38.619> to<00:01:38.950> harvest<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.509> compost

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
you're then able to harvest the compost

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.499 
you're then able to harvest the compost
from<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.499> other<00:01:41.649> side<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.729> not<00:01:42.969> all<00:01:43.179> worms

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
from the other side so not all worms

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.629 
from the other side so not all worms
will<00:01:43.810> follow<00:01:44.200> kind<00:01:44.829> of<00:01:44.920> behavior<00:01:45.490> you're

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
will follow kind of behavior you're

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.129 
will follow kind of behavior you're
encouraging<00:01:46.179> so<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.509> will<00:01:46.689> have<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.929> take<00:01:47.109> a

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
encouraging so you will have to take a

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.099 
encouraging so you will have to take a
few<00:01:47.380> extra<00:01:47.740> steps<00:01:47.999> you<00:01:48.999> could<00:01:49.299> just<00:01:49.749> simply

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
few extra steps you could just simply

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.039 
few extra steps you could just simply
put<00:01:50.770> them<00:01:50.889> into<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.189> plastic<00:01:51.429> bag<00:01:51.849> and<00:01:51.959> put<00:01:52.959> the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
put them into a plastic bag and put the

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.629 
put them into a plastic bag and put the
whole<00:01:53.200> sort<00:01:53.439> all<00:01:53.859> the<00:01:54.009> compost<00:01:54.340> into<00:01:54.549> a

whole sort all the compost into a
plastic<00:01:54.849> bag<00:01:55.209> but<00:01:55.779> there<00:01:55.929> will<00:01:56.020> still<00:01:56.289> be<00:01:56.349> some

plastic bag but there will still be some

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.559 
plastic bag but there will still be some
worms<00:01:57.069> that<00:01:57.279> remain<00:01:57.609> so

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
worms that remain so

important steps to take to separate the
worms<00:02:04.450> from<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.779> compost<00:02:05.520> well<00:02:06.520> give<00:02:06.669> you<00:02:06.729> an

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
worms from the compost well give you an

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:15.690 
worms from the compost well give you an
example<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.239> how<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.419> would<00:02:07.569> do<00:02:07.689> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.790 

so<00:02:16.700> imagine<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.210> we<00:02:17.300> had<00:02:17.480> nice<00:02:17.750> Sun<00:02:18.050> here<00:02:18.590> on

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
so imagine that we had nice Sun here on

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.670 
so imagine that we had nice Sun here on
this<00:02:19.160> plastic<00:02:20.030> bag<00:02:20.210> here<00:02:20.450> what<00:02:21.410> are<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> going

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
this plastic bag here what are you going

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.870 
this plastic bag here what are you going
to<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.160> you're<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.430> take<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> few

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
to do is you're going to take a few

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.670 
to do is you're going to take a few
handfuls<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.420> soil<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.930> you're<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.530> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
handfuls of soil and you're going to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.930 
handfuls of soil and you're going to
place<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:26.330> plastic<00:02:26.600> here<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
place it on the plastic here so you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.160 
place it on the plastic here so you
could<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.150> course<00:02:29.240> use<00:02:29.360> garden<00:02:29.780> gloves<00:02:29.870> but

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
could of course use garden gloves but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.350 
could of course use garden gloves but
I'll<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.830> with<00:02:31.040> my<00:02:31.190> hands<00:02:31.490> here<00:02:31.670> it's

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I'll just go with my hands here it's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.270 
I'll just go with my hands here it's
your<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.570> make<00:02:32.690> kind<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.960> cone-shaped<00:02:33.740> piles

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
your to make kind of cone-shaped piles

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.670 
your to make kind of cone-shaped piles
here<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.480> we're<00:02:35.660> gonna<00:02:35.750> use<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.440> fact

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
here and so we're gonna use the fact

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.200 
here and so we're gonna use the fact
that<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.890> worms<00:02:37.130> are<00:02:37.340> extremely<00:02:37.700> afraid<00:02:38.000> to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
that the worms are extremely afraid to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.910 
that the worms are extremely afraid to
the<00:02:38.300> light<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> because<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.530> dangerous

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
the light and because it's dangerous

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.650 
the light and because it's dangerous
because<00:02:40.130> they<00:02:40.280> might<00:02:40.400> dry<00:02:40.670> out<00:02:40.820> you're<00:02:41.570> gonna

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
because they might dry out you're gonna

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
because they might dry out you're gonna
make<00:02:41.870> nice<00:02:42.110> cone-shaped<00:02:42.830> piles<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
make nice cone-shaped piles here on the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.260 
make nice cone-shaped piles here on the
plastic<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> imagine<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.820> there's<00:02:47.030> nice<00:02:47.210> Sun

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
plastic so imagine that there's nice Sun

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.670 
plastic so imagine that there's nice Sun
the<00:02:50.270> worms<00:02:50.540> are<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.990> be<00:02:51.080> going<00:02:51.350> from<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
the worms are going to be going from the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.710 
the worms are going to be going from the
top<00:02:51.950> part<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.460> pile<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.000> slowly<00:02:53.480> going

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
top part of the pile and slowly going

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.170 
top part of the pile and slowly going
downwards<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.280> you're<00:02:55.400> going<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.640> do<00:02:55.880> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
downwards so what you're going to do is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.540 
downwards so what you're going to do is
wait<00:02:56.420> about<00:02:56.540> ten<00:02:56.960> minutes<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.560> during<00:02:58.310> that

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
wait about ten minutes and during that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.550 
wait about ten minutes and during that
time<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.060> worms<00:02:59.270> are<00:02:59.480> going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.690> crawl<00:02:59.960> from

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
time the worms are going to crawl from

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.410 
time the worms are going to crawl from
the<00:03:00.740> top<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.190> each<00:03:01.340> pile<00:03:01.700> let's<00:03:02.060> say<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.270> had

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
the top of each pile let's say we had

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.810 
the top of each pile let's say we had
about<00:03:02.740> almost<00:03:03.740> about<00:03:03.980> ten<00:03:04.190> piles<00:03:04.460> you<00:03:04.700> make

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
about almost about ten piles you make

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.640 
about almost about ten piles you make
small<00:03:05.030> piles<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.630> they're<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.470> slowly

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
small piles and they're going to slowly

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.430 
small piles and they're going to slowly
come<00:03:06.980> downwards<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.480> what<00:03:08.750> you're<00:03:08.840> gonna<00:03:08.900> do

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
come downwards so what you're gonna do

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.830 
come downwards so what you're gonna do
is<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.890> off<00:03:10.130> about<00:03:10.400> two<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.030> three<00:03:11.060> inches<00:03:11.300> of

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
is take off about two to three inches of

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.440 
is take off about two to three inches of
soil<00:03:12.170> from<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.770> top<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.220> each<00:03:13.400> cone<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.360> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
soil from the top of each cone so the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.180 
soil from the top of each cone so the
worms<00:03:14.660> are<00:03:14.810> moving<00:03:15.110> downwards<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:15.890> gonna<00:03:16.040> go

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
worms are moving downwards it's gonna go

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.220 
worms are moving downwards it's gonna go
ahead<00:03:16.310> off<00:03:17.210> you<00:03:17.420> wait<00:03:17.570> about<00:03:17.690> 10<00:03:17.960> minutes

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
ahead off you wait about 10 minutes

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.800 
ahead off you wait about 10 minutes
remove<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.800> top<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.160> each<00:03:19.310> pile<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:20.630> should

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
remove the top of each pile it should

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.260 
remove the top of each pile it should
pretty<00:03:20.990> much<00:03:21.080> be<00:03:21.200> worm<00:03:21.500> free<00:03:22.000> pick<00:03:23.000> out<00:03:23.120> any

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
pretty much be worm free pick out any

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.110 
pretty much be worm free pick out any
stragglers<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.720> remain<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:25.090> place<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
stragglers that remain and place that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.670 
stragglers that remain and place that
into<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.660> separate<00:03:26.990> container<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.590> that's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
into a separate container and that's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
into a separate container and that's
finished<00:03:28.130> compost

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
finished compost

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.110 
finished compost
ready<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.150> be<00:03:29.240> used<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:30.110> then<00:03:31.040> we're<00:03:32.030> gonna

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
ready to be used and then we're gonna

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.730 
ready to be used and then we're gonna
wait<00:03:32.330> another<00:03:32.630> 10<00:03:32.960> minutes<00:03:33.140> or<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.350> and

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
wait another 10 minutes or so and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.650 
wait another 10 minutes or so and
continue<00:03:34.370> that<00:03:34.490> process<00:03:34.730> until<00:03:35.420> you're<00:03:35.570> at

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
continue that process until you're at

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.410 
continue that process until you're at
the<00:03:35.780> very<00:03:36.080> base<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.620> each<00:03:37.310> pile<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.030> now<00:03:38.209> all

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
the very base of each pile and now all

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.000 
the very base of each pile and now all
of<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.630> worms<00:03:38.840> should<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.530> plastic

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
of the worms should be on that plastic

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.800 
of the worms should be on that plastic
bag<00:03:40.340> itself<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:40.940> that's<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.150> great<00:03:41.360> way<00:03:41.540> to

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
bag itself so that's a great way to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.530 
bag itself so that's a great way to
separate<00:03:42.470> your<00:03:42.560> worms<00:03:42.800> from<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.250> compost<00:03:43.580> now

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
separate your worms from the compost now

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.420 
separate your worms from the compost now
at<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.810> point<00:03:44.870> it's<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.740> important<00:03:46.280> to

at that point it's really important to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.130 
at that point it's really important to
create<00:03:46.850> bedding<00:03:47.270> anew<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.750> what<00:03:47.900> you're<00:03:47.990> going
