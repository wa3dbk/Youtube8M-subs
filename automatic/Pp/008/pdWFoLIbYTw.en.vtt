00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:17.450
 on a newspaper and I go to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.450
 split it into two 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.280
 and once again divided into two 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:17.040
 now helping me with a toothpick I go to 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:20.850
 rolling childbirth from the tip and shake and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.020
 I keep turning until I create one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 sort of straw 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.540
 and ride always keeps turning in 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:45.830
 this way come to this point 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:48.039
 I put some glue vinavil to stop 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.039
 work 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 and here is the first straw finished 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.650
 now obviously I have to do others 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 then takes a circle is made with 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.640
 of the cardboard and I'm going to position it 17 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.640
 straws all around 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.780
 place the 17 straws I am going now 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.160
 take another card of the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.170
 same size as what I have 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:10.860
 positioned below and always cover it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:16.980
 with vinyl glue now 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:31.800
 position the circle in the center and go to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:34.860
 press and place a weight on and 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.780
 the other so for a few minutes 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:52.760
 taking a tube and pasting it into 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:52.760
 this way and pass the straw underneath 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:04.730
 so and I will have to alternate upstairs above 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.150
 below and I must continue like this 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.419
 keep for a few minutes maybe just 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.419
 from the beginning to the starting point 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.039
 when it arrived at the end of 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:45.270
 you take another straw is the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:45.270
 wedged in this way and continue 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.000
 to keep the various passages firm then 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.280
 you can very well help you with del 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.750
 putting clothespins and continue 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.750
 obviously the ride 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:25.189
 reached the desired height at this 

00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:26.989
 point we must of course shorten the 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:34.279
 longer straws that remain 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:36.349
 then cut a small piece and leave the 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:43.789
 in about a centimeter you keep and 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:48.259
 half I take some more glue and the 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:52.789
 put on the straw and then bend towards 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:56.209
 the inside and I use a clothespin in 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.649
 this case to keep the 

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:59.929
 piece and leave it of course 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.449
 dry for these that are then 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:04.549
 facing outwards 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:11.749
 I do the same thing ie I cut a 

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:17.449
 piece but not use with the fold 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:20.709
 then towards the outside the joint with the 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.709
 straw underneath 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:32.660
 it crushes me a little bit ok 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:36.379
 after which we obviously remove all the 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.870
 bills and fix up our own 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:43.330
 structure I didn't tell you 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:46.039
 how many straws I used to create 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.800
 the height because of leather than not 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:52.009
 little by little the height you want 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.930
 get so important to have 17 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.740
 straws at the base as we have seen 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:02.659
 now I am going to use del 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.169
 acrylic color and those the whole 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.169
 surface 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.400
 I have nothing left now but to transfer the 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.740
 contained within a container 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.170
 obviously recycled and here is mine 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.170
 ready-to-use lavender detergent
