00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.500 
tutorials com in this video we're going
to<00:00:08.490> learn<00:00:08.670> everything<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.269> we've<00:00:09.480> learned

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
to learn everything that we've learned

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
to learn everything that we've learned
so<00:00:09.900> far<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.349> graffiti<00:00:10.710> CD<00:00:11.010> series<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.550> put

so far on the graffiti CD series and put
it<00:00:12.120> all<00:00:12.240> together<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.809> actually<00:00:13.110> make<00:00:13.259> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
it all together to actually make a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.910 
it all together to actually make a
full-fledged<00:00:14.240> bicycle<00:00:15.240> lane<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> brick

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
full-fledged bicycle lane on a brick

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
full-fledged bicycle lane on a brick
path<00:00:17.190> we're<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> road<00:00:18.660> mark<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> whole

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
path we're going to road mark the whole

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.769 
path we're going to road mark the whole
thing<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.830> lines<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.670> forth<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.119> here's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
thing with lines and so forth so here's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
thing with lines and so forth so here's
our<00:00:21.900> image<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.039> probably<00:00:23.250> familiar

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
we're going to add cycle lane here to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.620 
we're going to add cycle lane here to
the<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:29.039> actual<00:00:29.400> text<00:00:29.760> form<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.570> to

add<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.199> symbol<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.189> bicycle<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> we're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
add a symbol here of a bicycle and we're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
add a symbol here of a bicycle and we're
going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> add<00:00:33.719> some<00:00:33.750> lines<00:00:34.380> across<00:00:34.920> delineate

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
going to add some lines across delineate

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.200 
going to add some lines across delineate
the<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.840> width<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> our<00:00:37.680> bicycle<00:00:38.430> line<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the the width of our bicycle line so

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
the the width of our bicycle line so
let's<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:39.989> now<00:00:40.290> yeah<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.980> start

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
let's get to it now yeah you can start

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
let's get to it now yeah you can start
from<00:00:41.340> any<00:00:41.520> point<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.180> i'm<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> start

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
from any point really i'm going to start

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 
from any point really i'm going to start
here<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> text<00:00:43.500> first<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.129> build

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
here with the text first and then build

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
here with the text first and then build
on<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.989> need<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.350> now

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
on from that so what we need to do now

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
on from that so what we need to do now
is<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.800> add<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.399> text<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.030> i'm<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> add

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
is just add the text so i'm going to add

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.670 
is just add the text so i'm going to add
in<00:00:48.539> our<00:00:48.870> texting<00:00:49.829> cycle<00:00:50.539> lane<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.649> are

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
in our texting cycle lane there we are

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.939 
in our texting cycle lane there we are
and<00:00:53.309> i'm<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.539> text

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
and i'm actually going to make this text

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.790 
and i'm actually going to make this text
quite<00:00:55.949> big<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.590> advantage<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
quite big and the the advantage of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.830 
quite big and the the advantage of
having<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.250> big<00:00:59.460> text<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.030> once<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.690> do

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
having a big text like this once we do

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
having a big text like this once we do
our<00:01:00.960> perspective<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.399> perspective

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
our perspective is that the perspective

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.060 
our perspective is that the perspective
will<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.369> this<00:01:05.369> size<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.880> text<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
will use you know this size of text and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.960 
will use you know this size of text and
distort<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.460> bigger<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:08.760> smaller

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
distort it to be bigger or smaller

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
distort it to be bigger or smaller
depending<00:01:09.360> where<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.260> place<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> image

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
depending where we place it on the image

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.160 
depending where we place it on the image
so<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.640> start<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> bigger<00:01:12.570> size

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so if you start off with the bigger size

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
so if you start off with the bigger size
text<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.250> less<00:01:14.460> distortion<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
text and there's a lot less distortion a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
text and there's a lot less distortion a
lot<00:01:15.930> less<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.470> photoshop<00:01:17.130> needs<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
lot less that photoshop needs to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
lot less that photoshop needs to
increase<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> size<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> text<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
increase the size of the text and it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.260 
increase the size of the text and it
looks<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.799> little<00:01:20.250> bit<00:01:20.430> fuzzy<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> start

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
looks a little bit fuzzy so if you start

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
looks a little bit fuzzy so if you start
off<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> big<00:01:21.840> size<00:01:22.140> text<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.250> only

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
off with a big size text then it only

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.109 
off with a big size text then it only
gets<00:01:23.670> smaller<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.869> smaller<00:01:26.119> reducing

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
gets smaller and the smaller reducing

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.490 
gets smaller and the smaller reducing
the<00:01:27.390> size<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.780> things<00:01:27.960> always<00:01:28.140> looks<00:01:28.439> better

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the size of things always looks better

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
the size of things always looks better
than<00:01:28.829> increasing<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.549> size<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.880> things<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
than increasing the size of things so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
than increasing the size of things so
that's<00:01:30.840> why<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that's why we do this and if you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's why we do this and if you
remember<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> previous<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.630> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
remember from the previous thing so we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
remember from the previous thing so we
just<00:01:33.960> need<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> select<00:01:34.590> our<00:01:34.799> text<00:01:35.150> copy<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
just need to select our text copy it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
just need to select our text copy it
make<00:01:37.290> sure<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.710> deselect<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
make sure that we deselect and then you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
make sure that we deselect and then you
can<00:01:39.689> probably<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.049> trash<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.920> layer<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
can probably just trash this layer we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
can probably just trash this layer we
don't<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.759> anymore<00:01:42.000> create<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> new<00:01:43.079> layer

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
don't need it anymore create a new layer

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.130 
don't need it anymore create a new layer
and<00:01:43.500> now<00:01:44.130> we're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:45.540> into<00:01:45.720> our

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and now we're going to go into our

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
and now we're going to go into our
vanishing<00:01:46.470> points<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:46.979> filter<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> vanishing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
vanishing points so filter a vanishing

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.929 
vanishing points so filter a vanishing
point<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.649> we<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.490> previously

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
point and we have here I've previously

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
point and we have here I've previously
made<00:01:51.360> our<00:01:51.600> plane<00:01:52.500> already<00:01:52.740> you've<00:01:52.979> probably

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
made our plane already you've probably

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
made our plane already you've probably
seen<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> other<00:01:53.880> tutorials<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.470> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
seen this in the other tutorials but you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.709 
seen this in the other tutorials but you
may<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.369> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.700> select<00:01:56.969> your<00:01:57.119> plane<00:01:57.420> here

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
may just want to select your plane here

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.410 
may just want to select your plane here
create<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.140> plane<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:59.399> sides<00:01:59.729> stretch

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
create your plane on all sides stretch

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
create your plane on all sides stretch
it<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> fit<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> entire<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.250> entirety<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it to fit the entire of the entirety of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.800 
it to fit the entire of the entirety of
the<00:02:02.939> image<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:03.719> actually

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the image because now we're actually

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.109 
the image because now we're actually
going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> add<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.320> lines<00:02:05.250> across<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.939> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
going to add some lines across this so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
going to add some lines across this so
we'll<00:02:06.299> need<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> cover<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> whole<00:02:07.229> size<00:02:07.619> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
we'll need to cover the whole size of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.369 
we'll need to cover the whole size of
the<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.759> image<00:02:09.030> plane<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.810> by

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the of the image plane which you do by

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.170 
the of the image plane which you do by
selecting<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> sides<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.060> good

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
selecting on the sides and the good

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.640 
selecting on the sides and the good
point<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.690> once<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.989> create<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.349> image

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
point is that once you create that image

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.910 
point is that once you create that image
fly

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
fly

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370 
fly
and<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.340> image<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.599> don't<00:02:16.050> need<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.260> do

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and for this image you don't need to do

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.220 
and for this image you don't need to do
it<00:02:16.470> again<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.160> it's<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.430> one-off<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.230> every

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it again so it's a one-off and every

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.530 
it again so it's a one-off and every
elements<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.220> back<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.819> add<00:02:21.000> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
elements that we go back in to add to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.809 
elements that we go back in to add to
our<00:02:21.569> image<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.040> plane<00:02:23.250> will<00:02:23.459> already<00:02:23.700> be

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
our image I the plane will already be

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
our image I the plane will already be
there<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.599> right<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:24.900> because<00:02:25.290> I've

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
there as it is right now because I've

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.290 
there as it is right now because I've
created<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.890> previously<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> good

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
created as previously so that's a good

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
created as previously so that's a good
thing<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.510> only<00:02:27.780> need<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.050> create<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> plane

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
thing you only need to create the plane

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.559 
thing you only need to create the plane
once<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.819> add<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.270> many

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
once and then you can add as many

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.690 
once and then you can add as many
elements<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.800> starting<00:02:32.610> off

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
elements as you like so starting off

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
elements as you like so starting off
with<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> text<00:02:33.330> we're<00:02:33.450> going<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.630> paste<00:02:33.870> this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
with the text we're going to paste this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
with the text we're going to paste this
in<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.340> we<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.700> our<00:02:35.910> cycle<00:02:36.330> line

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
in so that we have our cycle line

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
in so that we have our cycle line
remember<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.620> goes<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.010> without<00:02:38.280> any

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
remember it goes in without any

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.100 
remember it goes in without any
perspective<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.239> need<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> click<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.870> drag

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
perspective we need to click and drag

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860 
perspective we need to click and drag
inside<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:41.040> actually<00:02:41.190> make<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.870> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
inside of it to actually make it you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
inside of it to actually make it you
know<00:02:42.989> put<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.470> perspective<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.160> now<00:02:44.730> what

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
know put it in perspective and now what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.270 
know put it in perspective and now what
I'm<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.739> change<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> size<00:02:47.130> of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I'm going to do is change the size of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.800 
I'm going to do is change the size of
this<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.519> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.850> controlling<00:02:48.360> t<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
this I'm going to do a controlling t and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.920 
this I'm going to do a controlling t and
make<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.620> text<00:02:50.069> smaller<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.180> i'm<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.780> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
make this text smaller so i'm going to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.900 
make this text smaller so i'm going to
hold<00:02:52.110> down<00:02:52.230> shift<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.950> make<00:02:53.220> our<00:02:53.400> text<00:02:53.760> a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
hold down shift and make our text a

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.970 
hold down shift and make our text a
little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.239> smaller<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:55.410> i<00:02:55.440> said<00:02:55.590> now

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
little bit smaller and like i said now

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.039 
little bit smaller and like i said now
we<00:02:56.040> are<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.360> put<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> size<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
we are you know we can put the size of

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.509 
we are you know we can put the size of
the<00:02:58.110> text<00:02:58.290> anywhere<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.860> want<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.310> there'll

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
the text anywhere we want and there'll

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.309 
the text anywhere we want and there'll
be<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.640> lot<00:02:59.819> less<00:03:00.000> distortion<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> text

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
be a lot less distortion in the text

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.640 
be a lot less distortion in the text
actually<00:03:01.650> it'll<00:03:01.830> look<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.190> lot<00:03:02.610> cleaner<00:03:02.819> and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
actually it'll look a lot cleaner and

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.430 
actually it'll look a lot cleaner and
with<00:03:04.650> most<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.130> psycho<00:03:05.459> lines<00:03:06.350> text<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
with most of the psycho lines text the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920 
with most of the psycho lines text the
way<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.980> works<00:03:08.220> usually<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.450> they

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
way that it works usually is that they

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.410 
way that it works usually is that they
put<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:11.340> text<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.819> little<00:03:11.880> bit<00:03:12.060> distorted

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
put in the text a little bit distorted

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.199 
put in the text a little bit distorted
like<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.080> little<00:03:13.380> bit<00:03:13.500> lengthwise<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.060> that

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
like so a little bit lengthwise so that

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.259 
like so a little bit lengthwise so that
it's<00:03:15.330> easier<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.959> read<00:03:16.170> from<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.560> distance<00:03:17.269> so

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
it's easier to read from a distance so

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.280 
it's easier to read from a distance so
that's<00:03:18.540> what<00:03:18.660> we're<00:03:18.750> going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.930> do<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.049> we're

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
that's what we're going to do here we're

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.810 
that's what we're going to do here we're
just<00:03:19.320> simulating<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.100> exactly<00:03:20.579> so<00:03:20.700> we're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
just simulating that exactly so we're

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.180 
just simulating that exactly so we're
going<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> put<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.209> cycling<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:22.950> right

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
going to put in cycling like so right

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.170 
going to put in cycling like so right
here<00:03:23.400> at<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.640> top<00:03:23.780> cycle<00:03:24.780> lane<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.850> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
here at the top cycle lane like that so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.090 
here at the top cycle lane like that so
we<00:03:27.570> are<00:03:27.660> distorting<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.200> text<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.650> fit<00:03:28.890> our

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
we are distorting a text to fit our

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.400 
we are distorting a text to fit our
needs<00:03:29.820> here<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> most<00:03:30.870> important<00:03:31.230> part

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
needs here but the most important part

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.140 
needs here but the most important part
is<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.739> fitting<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.430> our<00:03:32.609> plane<00:03:32.880> that's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
is it's fitting in with our plane that's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.970 
is it's fitting in with our plane that's
that's<00:03:33.510> all<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:34.019> wanted<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> seem

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
that's all we wanted to make it seem

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.949 
that's all we wanted to make it seem
like<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.340> painted<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.359> surface<00:03:36.570> and

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
like it's painted on that surface and

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.590 
like it's painted on that surface and
not<00:03:37.859> anything<00:03:38.130> else<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:39.090> long<00:03:39.269> as<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.510> got

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
not anything else so as long as you got

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.270 
not anything else so as long as you got
the<00:03:39.660> plane<00:03:39.959> right<00:03:40.230> everything<00:03:40.980> will<00:03:41.010> look

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the plane right everything will look

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.250 
the plane right everything will look
perfect<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.329> distort<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.049> much<00:03:43.230> as

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
perfect you can distort it as much as

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
perfect you can distort it as much as
you<00:03:43.440> like<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:43.829> leave<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.549> as<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:44.850> I'm<00:03:45.450> going

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
you like or leave it as it is I'm going

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.380 
you like or leave it as it is I'm going
to<00:03:45.720> keep<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.109> this<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.500> click<00:03:47.459> OK<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
to keep it like this and click OK so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.120 
to keep it like this and click OK so
there<00:03:48.570> we<00:03:48.660> are<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:49.109> very<00:03:49.560> important<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:49.980> also

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
there we are it's very important to also

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.220 
there we are it's very important to also
notice<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.549> where<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.359> placed<00:03:51.660> their<00:03:51.840> text

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
notice that where we placed their text

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.710 
notice that where we placed their text
is<00:03:52.380> where<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:52.769> want<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.160> keep<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.670> text<00:03:54.030> you

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
is where we want to keep the text you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
is where we want to keep the text you
don't<00:03:55.019> want<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.470> then<00:03:55.829> move<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.609> will

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
don't want to then move this it will

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.090 
don't want to then move this it will
only<00:03:57.000> look<00:03:57.329> right<00:03:57.630> where<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:58.920> move

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
only look right where it is if you move

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.160 
only look right where it is if you move
it<00:03:59.250> it'll<00:03:59.489> look<00:03:59.609> off<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.180> when<00:04:01.019> you're

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
it it'll look off so when you're

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.479 
it it'll look off so when you're
positioning<00:04:01.739> things<00:04:01.980> make<00:04:02.220> sure<00:04:02.370> your

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
positioning things make sure your

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.430 
positioning things make sure your
positioning<00:04:03.000> them<00:04:03.180> inside<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.170> filter

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
positioning them inside of the filter

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.740 
positioning them inside of the filter
inside<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.890> vanishing<00:04:05.130> point<00:04:05.459> okay<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.600> now<00:04:06.690> we

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
inside of vanishing point okay so now we

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.720 
inside of vanishing point okay so now we
have<00:04:06.840> recycle<00:04:07.440> line<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.829> now<00:04:08.310> we<00:04:08.370> want<00:04:08.670> to

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
have recycle line and now we want to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.879 
have recycle line and now we want to
actually<00:04:08.910> add<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.239> effect<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.680> make<00:04:10.799> it

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
actually add the effect right to make it

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.860 
actually add the effect right to make it
seem<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:11.100> it's<00:04:11.370> painted<00:04:11.609> on<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.569> we<00:04:12.690> go<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
seem like it's painted on so we go to

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.250 
seem like it's painted on so we go to
our<00:04:12.989> blending<00:04:13.440> options<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:15.049> again<00:04:16.049> here

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
our blending options and again here

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.779 
our blending options and again here
we're<00:04:16.500> just<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.829> move<00:04:17.039> our<00:04:17.280> underlying

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
we're just going to move our underlying

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.610 
we're just going to move our underlying
layer<00:04:18.060> split<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.139> with<00:04:19.500> alt<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:21.320> move<00:04:22.320> our

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
layer split it with alt and move our

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.420 
layer split it with alt and move our
layer<00:04:23.159> around<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:23.940> da<00:04:24.180> little<00:04:24.599> slider<00:04:25.430> so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
layer around here da little slider so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.540 
layer around here da little slider so
it's<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.640> little<00:04:26.789> bit<00:04:26.880> light

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
it's a little bit light

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.110 
it's a little bit light
here<00:04:27.909> and<00:04:28.120> cut<00:04:28.990> off<00:04:29.169> some<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.849> white

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
here and cut off some of that the white

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.670 
here and cut off some of that the white
on<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.449> black<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:32.110> doesn't<00:04:32.379> make<00:04:32.440> much

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
on the black that doesn't make much

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.689 
on the black that doesn't make much
sense<00:04:33.150> there<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.360> are<00:04:34.389> how<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.289> looking

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
sense there we are how is that looking

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.279 
sense there we are how is that looking
okay<00:04:36.699> could<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.419> could<00:04:37.629> do<00:04:37.870> with<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.080> little

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
okay could it could do with a little

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.700 
okay could it could do with a little
less<00:04:38.440> on<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:38.949> white<00:04:39.220> here<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:39.879> let's<00:04:40.560> fade<00:04:41.560> it

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
less on the white here so let's fade it

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.730 
less on the white here so let's fade it
a<00:04:41.800> little<00:04:41.949> bit<00:04:42.129> more<00:04:43.319> that<00:04:44.319> thing<00:04:44.560> that's

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
a little bit more that thing that's

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.510 
a little bit more that thing that's
pretty<00:04:44.979> good<00:04:45.129> let's<00:04:45.340> do<00:04:45.759> a<00:04:45.789> little<00:04:46.030> bit<00:04:46.210> less

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
pretty good let's do a little bit less

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.710 
pretty good let's do a little bit less
there<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> go<00:04:48.699> it's<00:04:48.819> very<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.120> mean<00:04:49.419> it's<00:04:49.569> very

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
there you go it's very I mean it's very

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.240 
there you go it's very I mean it's very
fidgety<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.289> can<00:04:50.440> always<00:04:50.650> go<00:04:50.889> back<00:04:50.919> in

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
fidgety and you can always go back in

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.040 
fidgety and you can always go back in
right<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:51.729> click<00:04:51.940> OK<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.419> can<00:04:52.569> always<00:04:52.810> go

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
right you can click OK you can always go

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.719 
right you can click OK you can always go
back<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.650> doesn't<00:04:53.949> look<00:04:54.129> like<00:04:54.400> there's<00:04:54.639> an

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
back in it doesn't look like there's an

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.820 
back in it doesn't look like there's an
effect<00:04:55.030> but<00:04:55.240> there<00:04:55.419> is<00:04:55.539> you<00:04:56.409> just<00:04:56.470> go<00:04:56.680> back

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
effect but there is you just go back

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
to create a new layer make sure you are

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.350 
to create a new layer make sure you are
on<00:05:31.840> a<00:05:32.080> new<00:05:32.259> layer<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.650> we're<00:05:33.460> going<00:05:33.819> to<00:05:33.849> then

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
on a new layer and we're going to then

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.269 
on a new layer and we're going to then
create<00:05:34.569> our<00:05:34.900> bicycle<00:05:35.469> shape<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.860> we<00:05:36.009> don't<00:05:36.159> do

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
create our bicycle shape and we don't do

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.469 
create our bicycle shape and we don't do
this<00:05:36.400> in<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.699> same<00:05:36.880> way<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.150> we've<00:05:37.300> done

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479

this in the same way that we've done
with<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.110> text<00:05:38.469> we<00:05:38.560> want<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.770> do<00:05:38.830> a<00:05:38.860> big<00:05:39.159> one

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
with the text we want to do a big one

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.860 
with the text we want to do a big one
holding<00:05:39.940> down<00:05:40.060> shift<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.599> it's<00:05:40.719> not<00:05:40.810> a

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
holding down shift so it's not a

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.439 
holding down shift so it's not a
distorted<00:05:41.409> bicycle<00:05:41.830> not<00:05:42.069> yet<00:05:42.310> anyways<00:05:42.759> we

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
distorted bicycle not yet anyways we

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.939 
distorted bicycle not yet anyways we
want<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.719> distort<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.139> in<00:05:44.229> perspective<00:05:44.500> so

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
want to distort it in perspective so

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.430 
want to distort it in perspective so
we're<00:05:45.069> going<00:05:45.159> to<00:05:45.250> do<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:45.819> shape<00:05:46.150> like<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:46.659> then

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
we're going to do a shape like so then

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.870 
we're going to do a shape like so then
I'm<00:05:47.590> going<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:47.830> go<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.099> bring<00:05:48.370> in<00:05:48.490> our<00:05:48.580> paths

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
filter vanishing point see our plane is

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.110 
filter vanishing point see our plane is
already<00:06:26.379> there<00:06:26.590> good<00:06:27.129> to<00:06:27.279> go<00:06:27.400> now<00:06:27.580> we're<00:06:28.029> going

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
already there good to go now we're going

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.779 
already there good to go now we're going
to<00:06:28.210> do<00:06:28.300> a<00:06:28.330> ctrl<00:06:28.750> +<00:06:28.930> V<00:06:29.199> to<00:06:29.440> paste<00:06:29.740> our<00:06:30.250> bicycle<00:06:30.699> in

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
to do a ctrl + V to paste our bicycle in

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.939 
to do a ctrl + V to paste our bicycle in
and<00:06:31.000> now<00:06:31.360> we're<00:06:31.449> going<00:06:31.539> to<00:06:31.599> move<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.960> in<00:06:32.080> so<00:06:32.830> now

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
and now we're going to move it in so now

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.159 
and now we're going to move it in so now
we<00:06:33.009> have<00:06:33.099> our<00:06:33.219> bicycle<00:06:33.610> in<00:06:33.759> perspective<00:06:34.300> zoom

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
we have our bicycle in perspective zoom

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:36.659 
we have our bicycle in perspective zoom
out<00:06:35.259> a<00:06:35.319> little<00:06:35.440> bit<00:06:35.680> here<00:06:35.889> now<00:06:36.370> we're<00:06:36.430> going<00:06:36.550> to

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
out a little bit here now we're going to

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:37.950 
out a little bit here now we're going to
make<00:06:36.729> this<00:06:36.789> smaller<00:06:37.300> so<00:06:37.599> I'm<00:06:37.659> going<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.870> do<00:06:37.930> a

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
make this smaller so I'm going to do a

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.500 
make this smaller so I'm going to do a
ctrl<00:06:38.349> +<00:06:38.529> T

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
ctrl + T

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.540 
ctrl + T
and<00:06:40.430> make<00:06:41.430> the<00:06:41.580> smaller<00:06:42.000> here<00:06:42.330> on<00:06:42.480> the<00:06:42.660> edge

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
and make the smaller here on the edge

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.810 
and make the smaller here on the edge
there<00:06:44.550> we<00:06:44.700> are<00:06:44.730> and<00:06:45.180> I'm<00:06:45.990> going<00:06:46.230> to<00:06:46.290> again<00:06:46.830> much

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
there we are and I'm going to again much

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.820 
there we are and I'm going to again much
in<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.030> same<00:06:48.120> way<00:06:48.300> here<00:06:48.810> and<00:06:48.990> it's<00:06:49.650> good

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
in the same way here and it's good

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.440 
in the same way here and it's good
because<00:06:49.860> you<00:06:50.100> can<00:06:50.130> line<00:06:50.550> you<00:06:50.820> can<00:06:51.000> line<00:06:51.210> this

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
because you can line you can line this

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.140 
because you can line you can line this
stuff<00:06:51.660> up<00:06:51.840> here<00:06:52.110> with<00:06:52.290> our<00:06:52.470> text<00:06:52.890> here<00:06:53.160> so<00:06:53.970> it's

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
stuff up here with our text here so it's

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150 
stuff up here with our text here so it's
the<00:06:54.300> same<00:06:54.540> width<00:06:54.870> there<00:06:55.290> we<00:06:55.500> aren't<00:06:55.740> like<00:06:55.890> so

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
the same width there we aren't like so

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.020 
the same width there we aren't like so
and<00:06:56.870> we<00:06:57.870> can<00:06:58.020> place<00:06:58.260> it<00:06:58.500> like<00:06:59.130> that<00:06:59.340> and<00:06:59.610> then

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
and we can place it like that and then

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.330 
and we can place it like that and then
stretch<00:07:00.480> our<00:07:00.750> bicycle<00:07:01.500> symbol<00:07:01.890> if<00:07:02.010> we<00:07:02.160> like

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
stretch our bicycle symbol if we like

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.790 
stretch our bicycle symbol if we like
and<00:07:02.610> even<00:07:03.150> place<00:07:03.450> it<00:07:03.630> down<00:07:03.750> so<00:07:04.050> it's<00:07:04.170> being<00:07:04.500> cut

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
and even place it down so it's being cut

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.530 
and even place it down so it's being cut
off<00:07:04.830> actually<00:07:05.400> I'm<00:07:05.490> holding<00:07:05.790> down<00:07:05.910> shift<00:07:05.970> and

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
off actually I'm holding down shift and

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.450 
off actually I'm holding down shift and
you<00:07:07.110> can<00:07:07.230> see<00:07:07.410> that<00:07:07.440> as<00:07:07.680> I<00:07:07.800> hold<00:07:07.950> down<00:07:08.130> shift

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
you can see that as I hold down shift

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.760 
you can see that as I hold down shift
it's<00:07:08.940> actually<00:07:09.150> moving<00:07:09.740> with<00:07:10.740> the

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
it's actually moving with the

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.320 
it's actually moving with the
perspective<00:07:11.520> here<00:07:11.670> so<00:07:11.820> that's<00:07:11.970> quite<00:07:12.090> good<00:07:12.180> so

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
perspective here so that's quite good so

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.660 
perspective here so that's quite good so
you<00:07:12.510> can<00:07:12.630> place<00:07:12.870> things<00:07:13.170> in<00:07:13.350> perspective<00:07:13.670> like

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
you can place things in perspective like

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.400 
you can place things in perspective like
so<00:07:14.910> isn't<00:07:15.270> that<00:07:15.330> cool<00:07:15.570> so<00:07:16.200> we<00:07:16.290> can<00:07:16.440> place<00:07:16.650> our

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
so isn't that cool so we can place our

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.860 
so isn't that cool so we can place our
text<00:07:19.410> here<00:07:19.650> or<00:07:19.800> a<00:07:19.880> logo<00:07:20.880> of<00:07:21.150> the<00:07:21.180> bike<00:07:21.450> here

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
text here or a logo of the bike here

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.460 
text here or a logo of the bike here
like<00:07:22.710> so<00:07:23.010> okay<00:07:23.550> and<00:07:23.810> click<00:07:24.810> OK<00:07:25.050> once<00:07:25.260> we're
