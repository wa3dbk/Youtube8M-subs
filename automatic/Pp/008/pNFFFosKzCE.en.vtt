hey guys today I've brought you a triple
piston<00:00:02.939> extender<00:00:03.440> a<00:00:04.440> while<00:00:05.009> back<00:00:05.569> actually

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
piston extender a while back actually

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.290 
piston extender a while back actually
around<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.220> think<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.309> was<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.550> first<00:00:08.820> video

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
around I think it was my first video

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.560 
around I think it was my first video
with<00:00:09.570> fraps<00:00:11.750> I<00:00:13.460> made<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> trove<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.210> his'n

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
with fraps I made a trove of his'n

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.230 
with fraps I made a trove of his'n
extender<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.139> worked<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.760> one<00:00:17.760> point<00:00:18.000> four

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
extender that worked in one point four

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.470 
extender that worked in one point four
point<00:00:18.270> seven<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:22.340> then<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:24.000> outdated

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
point seven and and then it got outdated

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.589 
point seven and and then it got outdated
as<00:00:24.869> 1.5<00:00:25.380> came<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:27.390> new

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
as 1.5 came out and all these new

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.849 
as 1.5 came out and all these new
updates<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.320> new<00:00:29.039> blocks<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.670> you've<00:00:30.859> wiring

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
updates and new blocks and you've wiring

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.639 
updates and new blocks and you've wiring
systems<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> just<00:00:32.790> broke<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.300> didn't<00:00:33.570> work

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.319 

but<00:00:37.649> today<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:39.079> actually<00:00:40.079> i<00:00:40.559> always<00:00:41.489> said<00:00:41.989> i

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
but today and actually i always said i

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
but today and actually i always said i
think<00:00:45.329> i<00:00:45.450> said<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> description<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.649> maybe

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
think i said in the description or maybe

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.650 
think i said in the description or maybe
in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> video<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.910> i<00:00:50.940> would<00:00:51.239> bring<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in the video that i would bring you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.790 
in the video that i would bring you
another<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> today<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.559> my

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
another one and today I have this is my

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.110 
another one and today I have this is my
own<00:00:56.010> design<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.789> works<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.300> fine<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:59.219> still

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
own design it works just fine I still

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
own design it works just fine I still
haven't<00:01:00.300> tested<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.989> an<00:01:01.260> orientation

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
haven't tested if has an orientation

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
haven't tested if has an orientation
problem<00:01:02.250> probably<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> video

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
problem probably when I cut the video

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.040 
problem probably when I cut the video
I'll<00:01:03.570> test<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.040 

so<00:01:09.050> it's<00:01:09.980> pretty<00:01:10.220> fast<00:01:10.550> it's<00:01:11.060> really<00:01:11.480> compact

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
so it's pretty fast it's really compact

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.710 
so it's pretty fast it's really compact
I<00:01:12.380> think<00:01:12.620> it<00:01:12.710> may<00:01:12.860> even<00:01:12.890> better<00:01:13.310> be<00:01:13.730> more

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
I think it may even better be more

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.510 
I think it may even better be more
compact<00:01:15.080> than<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.410> other<00:01:15.560> one<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:18.340> as<00:01:19.340> you

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
compact than the other one and as you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.690 
compact than the other one and as you
can<00:01:19.670> see<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.030> super<00:01:20.870> duper<00:01:21.110> fast<00:01:22.990> it's<00:01:26.200> yeah

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
can see it's super duper fast it's yeah

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.790 
can see it's super duper fast it's yeah
like<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:28.850> said<00:01:29.060> it's<00:01:29.240> my<00:01:29.420> own<00:01:29.540> design<00:01:29.800> it's

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
like I said it's my own design it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.050 
like I said it's my own design it's
pretty<00:01:31.310> cheap<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.910> only<00:01:32.090> uses<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:33.280> piece<00:01:34.280> wait

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
pretty cheap it only uses one piece wait

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.680 
pretty cheap it only uses one piece wait
till<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.450> oh<00:01:36.280> no<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.400> doesn't<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.480> doesn't

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
till it oh no it doesn't so it doesn't

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.570 
till it oh no it doesn't so it doesn't
even<00:01:38.930> use<00:01:39.050> one<00:01:39.440> piece<00:01:39.650> of<00:01:39.830> glow<00:01:39.950> stone<00:01:40.220> at<00:01:40.460> all

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
even use one piece of glow stone at all

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.220 
even use one piece of glow stone at all
so<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:41.510> pretty<00:01:41.720> cheap<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.200> build<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:44.230> yeah

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
so it's pretty cheap to build and yeah

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.780 
so it's pretty cheap to build and yeah
let's<00:01:45.470> get<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.740> building<00:01:45.980> all<00:01:46.640> right

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
let's get to building all right

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.210 
let's get to building all right
everything<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.330> need<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:47.750> build<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:49.010> in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
everything you need to build this is in

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.420 
everything you need to build this is in
my<00:01:49.370> car<00:01:50.080> first<00:01:51.080> you<00:01:51.230> want<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.410> place<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.950> block

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
my car first you want to place a block

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.760 
my car first you want to place a block
there<00:01:52.790> put<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> lever<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.230> side<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
there put a lever on the side like that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.160 
there put a lever on the side like that
and<00:01:55.760> then<00:01:56.060> three<00:01:56.780> bits<00:01:57.200> redstone<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:59.690> all

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
and then three bits redstone on all

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.440 
and then three bits redstone on all
sides<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.040> block<00:02:01.220> then<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.030> want<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.300> dig

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
sides of the block then you want to dig

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.420 
sides of the block then you want to dig
down<00:02:02.630> or<00:02:03.050> go<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.740> side<00:02:03.980> of<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.250> wall

want<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.110> go<00:02:13.630> through<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.840> block<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.410> then

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
want to go through one block and then

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.970 
want to go through one block and then
take<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:16.910> another<00:02:17.180> place<00:02:17.570> or<00:02:17.750> Bob<00:02:18.320> there<00:02:18.680> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980

take out another place or Bob there and
then<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> repeater<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.050> vortex

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
then put a repeater on vortex

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.080 
then put a repeater on vortex
and<00:02:23.070> right<00:02:23.520> there<00:02:23.870> okay<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.090> here

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
is where your free pistons are gonna go

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.740 
is where your free pistons are gonna go
on<00:02:30.090> your<00:02:30.150> block<00:02:32.810> huh<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.170> then<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.950> want<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
on your block huh and then you want to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.770 
on your block huh and then you want to
go<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.140> site<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> block

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
go to this site and then put a block

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.730 
go to this site and then put a block
there<00:02:40.250> it's<00:02:41.250> done<00:02:41.430> torch<00:02:41.790> their<00:02:42.230> block<00:02:43.230> above

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
there it's done torch their block above

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.450

down there and then a block there so it
goes<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.750> piston<00:04:34.140> okay<00:04:35.010> let's<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:35.550> it
