00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
not quite as much as of a flashy knife

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.209 
not quite as much as of a flashy knife
is<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> Manics<00:01:59.640> too<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:02.070> want

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
is like the Manics too but I don't want

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
is like the Manics too but I don't want
to<00:02:02.280> carry<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.549> big<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> knife<00:02:03.119> every<00:02:03.479> day

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
