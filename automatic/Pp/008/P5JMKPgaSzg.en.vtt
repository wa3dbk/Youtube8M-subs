 Everything thought up for your guests 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:46.700
 Of course that starts with landscheid 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:50.450
 the culinary and we have in 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.750
 We have a cabaret in our kitchen 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.250
 Duck offered variants among us 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.860

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.260
 seasonally accompanied with a fresh 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.930
 his red cabbage and continues to grow 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.150
 nice but of course christmas without 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.860
 Crispy goose is for many nixon 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.190
 Of course, the Christmas goose have as well 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 we will be very fresh from the spit 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 to prepare the whole gives them then it 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.490
 but a cold buffet and, above all, something 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.970
 are there any if they are these 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.420
 king crab where the panzer in the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.070
 group becomes about a meter of a top 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.110
 meter wide plus the arms still 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.610
 once this meat is very tender 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.030
 and I thought I would do one 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.670
 surprise and bought this kbc 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.950
 and buffets austria we offer the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.140
 now cold on with a cocktail of his 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 Tomato sauce fish has always been one 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.670
 because of the whole diet 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.130
 actually also in this direction fish 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 and vegetables in my opinion go 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.620
 should be two times fishing week in the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.800
 I definitely recommend 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.110
 and so we now have currently a 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.340
 red snapper we have a growler we 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.050
 have a salmon trout too and we 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.540
 have too 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.210
 makes this little buffet every house 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.640
 his vanilla kipper himself of course 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.890
 with a real family 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.360

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.610
 also the possibility maybe somewhere 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.720
 to pick such a Christmas present 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.470

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.770
 and to offer the health 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.930
 I think of our home-made ones 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.180
 jams all our cities offer 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.580
 that and it's easy for you 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.320

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.590
 bring sympathetic gifts 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.970
 without spending a great deal now 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.440

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.160

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.270
 to capture the Christmas spirit 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.350
 Mr. Professor, that's what it is too 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.669
 special that we have a n restaurant 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.169
 integrate very strongly integrated 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.110
 not only because of the regional recipes 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.669
 and this tracking of a certain 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.500
 internationality that we of course 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.169
 but then again 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.930
 this strong Austrian tradition 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.940
 this modern and this one and that 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.640
 now and then interpreted 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.500
 culinary and Christmas now that 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.419

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.150
 but especially christmas is getting stuck 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.550

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.200
