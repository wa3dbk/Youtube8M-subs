all<00:00:00.539> right<00:00:00.989> friends<00:00:01.290> welcome<00:00:01.709> back<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.700> in

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
all right friends welcome back so in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.860 
all right friends welcome back so in
this<00:00:02.879> lecture<00:00:03.090> we're<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> cover<00:00:03.600> two

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
this lecture we're going to cover two

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.530 
this lecture we're going to cover two
things<00:00:04.170> one<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:05.150> asianglow<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:07.379> other<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
things one is asianglow and the other is

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.509 
things one is asianglow and the other is
pharmacogenomics<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.349> asianglow<00:00:11.130> or

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
pharmacogenomics and so asianglow or

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.629 
pharmacogenomics and so asianglow or
alcohol<00:00:12.120> induced<00:00:12.630> flushing<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.400> want<00:00:14.580> to

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
alcohol induced flushing what we want to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.070 
alcohol induced flushing what we want to
do<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.849> understand<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.450> well<00:00:15.690> enough<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
do is understand that well enough to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380 
do is understand that well enough to
explain<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> patient<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.609> also<00:00:17.820> related

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
explain it to a patient but also related

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689 
explain it to a patient but also related
to<00:00:18.720> something<00:00:18.930> called<00:00:19.580> pharmacogenomics

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to something called pharmacogenomics

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.960 
to something called pharmacogenomics
and<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.330> pharmacogenomics<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.970> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and what pharmacogenomics is is the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.670 
and what pharmacogenomics is is the
study<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.449> genetic<00:00:24.960> differences<00:00:25.439> can

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
study of how genetic differences can

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.210 
study of how genetic differences can
affect<00:00:26.039> drug<00:00:26.580> metabolism<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.900> case

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
affect drug metabolism and in this case

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
affect drug metabolism and in this case
alcohol<00:00:29.220> metabolism<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.119> why<00:00:30.240> Asians<00:00:30.900> are

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
alcohol metabolism and why Asians are

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.889 
alcohol metabolism and why Asians are
more<00:00:31.890> predisposed<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.880> getting<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.270> alcohol

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
more predisposed to getting this alcohol

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.510 
more predisposed to getting this alcohol
induced<00:00:34.170> flushed<00:00:34.710> compared<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> Caucasians

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
induced flushed compared to Caucasians

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.860 
induced flushed compared to Caucasians
so<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.210> picture<00:00:39.570> here

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so what we can see in this picture here

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.010 
so what we can see in this picture here
is<00:00:40.020> an<00:00:40.469> Asian<00:00:40.860> before<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.610> after<00:00:42.480> drinking

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
is an Asian before and after drinking

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.860 
is an Asian before and after drinking
alcohol<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.550> redness<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.629> here

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
alcohol and the redness that we see here

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
alcohol and the redness that we see here
is<00:00:46.020> called<00:00:46.370> alcohol<00:00:47.370> induced<00:00:47.730> flushing<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
is called alcohol induced flushing I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
is called alcohol induced flushing I
said<00:00:49.140> asianglow<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.280> sometimes<00:00:50.640> called<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
said asianglow it sometimes called the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.540 
said asianglow it sometimes called the
Asian<00:00:51.329> flush<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.890> happens<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Asian flush and what happens here is you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.639 
Asian flush and what happens here is you
take<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> sip<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> beer<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.600> any<00:00:55.020> alcohol<00:00:55.199> for

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
take a sip of beer or any alcohol for

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.979 
take a sip of beer or any alcohol for
that<00:00:55.800> matter<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> within<00:00:56.489> minutes<00:00:57.120> right

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that matter and within minutes right

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.470 
that matter and within minutes right
within<00:00:58.230> 15<00:00:58.680> minutes<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.910> reddening

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
within 15 minutes you get this reddening

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
within 15 minutes you get this reddening
of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> face<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.500> neck<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.160> can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of the face or in the neck that we can

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
of the face or in the neck that we can
see<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.180> maybe<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.989> itching

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
see here a little bit maybe some itching

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.149 
see here a little bit maybe some itching
on<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.710> upper<00:01:04.949> torso<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.869> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.650> result

on your upper torso and this is a result

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
on your upper torso and this is a result
of<00:01:08.570> genetic<00:01:09.570> differences<00:01:10.049> amongst<00:01:10.530> Asian

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

picture so what we see here is this H

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
picture so what we see here is this H
this<00:01:32.070> alcohol<00:01:32.549> induced<00:01:32.820> flushing<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.509> this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
this alcohol induced flushing and this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.069 
this alcohol induced flushing and this
is<00:01:33.990> common<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.799> East<00:01:35.280> Asians<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> occurs

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
is common in East Asians so it occurs

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.429 
is common in East Asians so it occurs
and<00:01:37.439> actually<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:38.070> third<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.840> East<00:01:39.840> Asians

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and actually one third of East Asians

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.940 
and actually one third of East Asians
East<00:01:41.479> Asians<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> say<00:01:43.020> East<00:01:43.350> Asians

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
East Asians and when I say East Asians

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.080 
East Asians and when I say East Asians
I'm<00:01:44.159> referring<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.850> Japanese<00:01:45.770> Taiwanese<00:01:47.090> or

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
I'm referring to Japanese Taiwanese or

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.580 
I'm referring to Japanese Taiwanese or
Koreans<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.530> East<00:01:49.770> Asians<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.299> this

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
Koreans so East Asians and they get this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.230 
Koreans so East Asians and they get this
flushing

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.380 

and<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.080> first<00:01:56.170> question<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.770> why<00:01:57.310> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and so the first question is why is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960 
and so the first question is why is
alcohol<00:01:58.390> causing<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.229> and<00:01:59.700> that's<00:02:00.700> kind<00:02:00.940> of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
alcohol causing this and that's kind of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.969 
alcohol causing this and that's kind of
a<00:02:01.060> trick<00:02:01.270> question<00:02:01.720> because<00:02:02.170> surprisingly

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
a trick question because surprisingly

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.670 
a trick question because surprisingly
the<00:02:03.220> answer<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.760> it's<00:02:03.970> not<00:02:04.210> alcohol<00:02:04.840> that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the answer is that it's not alcohol that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.740 
the answer is that it's not alcohol that
is<00:02:05.830> directly<00:02:06.280> causing<00:02:06.760> this<00:02:06.940> redness<00:02:07.450> but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
is directly causing this redness but

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.030 
is directly causing this redness but
instead<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.039> metabolite<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.970> alcohol<00:02:11.040> so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
instead it's a metabolite of alcohol so

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860 
instead it's a metabolite of alcohol so
I'm<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.670> write<00:02:12.850> here<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.270> alcohol

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
I'm just going to write here is alcohol

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.350 
I'm just going to write here is alcohol
and<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.739> not<00:02:14.980> alcohol<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.700> instead<00:02:16.000> it's<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and it's not alcohol but instead it's a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.449 
and it's not alcohol but instead it's a
metabolite<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.230> alcohol<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> that

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
metabolite of alcohol and that

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.160 
metabolite of alcohol and that
metabolite<00:02:19.150> my<00:02:19.300> friends<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.810> called

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
metabolite my friends is called

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.380 
metabolite my friends is called
acetaldehyde<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> acetaldehyde<00:02:24.239> Alde<00:02:25.410> hyd<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
acetaldehyde so acetaldehyde Alde hyd so

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.270 
acetaldehyde so acetaldehyde Alde hyd so
let's<00:02:28.570> put<00:02:28.810> acetaldehyde<00:02:29.320> in<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.830> little<00:02:30.040> box

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
let's put acetaldehyde in a little box

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.780 
let's put acetaldehyde in a little box
because<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.560> key<00:02:32.920> player<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.610> this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
because this is the key player here this

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.970 
because this is the key player here this
is<00:02:34.060> what's<00:02:34.239> causing<00:02:34.540> all<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.290> our<00:02:35.410> problems

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
is what's causing all of our problems

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.280 
is what's causing all of our problems
interestingly<00:02:36.700> its<00:02:37.180> acetaldehyde<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:38.170> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
interestingly its acetaldehyde that is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.590 
interestingly its acetaldehyde that is
also<00:02:38.560> causing<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> majority<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.209> hangover

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
also causing a majority of the hangover

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.380 
also causing a majority of the hangover
effects<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.170> alcohol<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.850> what's<00:02:43.030> going<00:02:43.269> on

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
effects of alcohol so what's going on

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.930 
effects of alcohol so what's going on
well<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:45.040> we<00:02:45.190> see<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.459> redness<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
well right here we see this redness of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.640 
well right here we see this redness of
the<00:02:45.970> skin<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.510> what's<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the skin so what's going on is in the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.710 
the skin so what's going on is in the
periphery<00:02:48.100> near<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.459> skin<00:02:48.700> acetaldehyde

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
periphery near the skin acetaldehyde

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.920 
periphery near the skin acetaldehyde
is<00:02:49.959> causing<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:52.140> release<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:54.660> things<00:02:55.660> called

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
is causing the release of things called

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.420 
is causing the release of things called
histamine<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.000> prostaglandins<00:03:01.079> so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
histamine and prostaglandins so

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.569 
histamine and prostaglandins so
histamine<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:06.120> prostaglandins<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:08.320> what

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.590 

prostaglandins<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:15.250> if<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.269> remember

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
prostaglandins and so if we remember

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.930 
prostaglandins and so if we remember
from<00:03:16.690> physiology<00:03:17.640> histamine<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
from physiology histamine is a

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.400 
from physiology histamine is a
vasodilator<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.760> prostaglandins<00:03:21.760> like<00:03:22.410> pge2

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
vasodilator and prostaglandins like pge2

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.250 
vasodilator and prostaglandins like pge2
or<00:03:26.070> pge2<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.239> specific<00:03:28.959> name<00:03:29.230> of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
or pge2 this is the specific name of

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.410 
or pge2 this is the specific name of
those<00:03:29.650> prostaglandins<00:03:30.579> these<00:03:31.209> are

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
those prostaglandins these are

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.580 
those prostaglandins these are
vasodilators<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.700> vaso<00:03:35.400> dilators<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.590> so

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
vasodilators so vaso dilators and so

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.620 
vasodilators so vaso dilators and so
what<00:03:38.739> they<00:03:38.890> do<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.310> they<00:03:39.459> widen<00:03:39.940> your<00:03:39.970> arteries

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
what they do is they widen your arteries

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.470 
what they do is they widen your arteries
your<00:03:40.750> veins<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.380> they<00:03:42.090> increase<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.299> blood

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
your veins and they increase the blood

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.130 
your veins and they increase the blood
flow<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:44.109> your<00:03:44.579> skin<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:45.790> remember<00:03:46.690> blood<00:03:46.959> is

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
flow to your skin and remember blood is

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.870 
flow to your skin and remember blood is
obviously<00:03:47.560> red<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.130> we<00:03:48.220> increase<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.700> blood

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
obviously red so we increase the blood

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.420 
obviously red so we increase the blood
flow<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.359> skin<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.799> facial

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
flow to the skin and we get this facial

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.819 
flow to the skin and we get this facial
flushing<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.109> is<00:03:53.290> what's<00:03:53.500> causing

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
flushing and so this is what's causing

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.640 
flushing and so this is what's causing
the<00:03:54.310> flushing

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.339 

so<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.310> got<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.580> know<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.870> histamine<00:03:59.870> is<00:04:00.110> is

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
so you got to know this histamine is is

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.940 
so you got to know this histamine is is
pretty<00:04:01.010> proven<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:02.000> cause<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:03.470> flushing

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
pretty proven to cause this flushing

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
pretty proven to cause this flushing
here<00:04:04.099> prostaglandins<00:04:04.879> we<00:04:05.030> know<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.420> they

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
here prostaglandins we know that they

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.649 
here prostaglandins we know that they
cause<00:04:06.200> vasodilation<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.580> well<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
cause vasodilation as well and so the

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.420 
cause vasodilation as well and so the
reason<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.049> need<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.530> know<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:09.890> is<00:04:10.159> because

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
reason you need to know this is because

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.300 
reason you need to know this is because
a<00:04:10.580> patient<00:04:10.819> might<00:04:11.209> ask<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.810> doc<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:13.099> is

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
a patient might ask you a doc what is

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.960 
a patient might ask you a doc what is
causing<00:04:13.819> flushing<00:04:14.299> that's<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.530> answer

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
causing flushing that's the answer

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.069 
causing flushing that's the answer
histamine<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.000> prostaglandins<00:04:17.299> from

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
histamine and prostaglandins from

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.199 
histamine and prostaglandins from
acetaldehyde<00:04:18.560> but<00:04:19.340> what<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.489> you<00:04:19.549> might<00:04:19.970> also

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
acetaldehyde but what do you might also

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.590 
acetaldehyde but what do you might also
want<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> know<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.870> how<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.100> treat<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:23.000> you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
want to know is how can I treat this you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.450 
want to know is how can I treat this you
know<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.930> rat<00:04:24.229> or<00:04:24.530> this<00:04:24.680> reddening<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:25.430> I

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
know this rat or this reddening that I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.500 
know this rat or this reddening that I
get<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:26.060> alcohol<00:04:26.449> induce<00:04:26.870> flushing<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.860> so

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
get this alcohol induce flushing and so

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.939 
get this alcohol induce flushing and so
what's<00:04:29.510> happening<00:04:29.960> here<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.350> this<00:04:30.530> your

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
what's happening here is that this your

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.680 
what's happening here is that this your
answer<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.490> him<00:04:31.520> should<00:04:31.850> be<00:04:31.880> well<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.449> is<00:04:32.660> a

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
answer to him should be well this is a

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.430 
answer to him should be well this is a
reaction<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.889> a<00:04:33.919> drug<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.550> any<00:04:35.479> sort<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.139> drug

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
reaction to a drug and any sort of drug

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.010 
reaction to a drug and any sort of drug
reaction<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.130> we<00:04:37.220> get<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.699> best<00:04:38.510> solution

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
reaction that we get the best solution

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.890 
reaction that we get the best solution
is<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.320> avoid<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.949> offending<00:04:40.490> agent<00:04:40.699> so<00:04:41.660> let's

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
is to avoid the offending agent so let's

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.050 
is to avoid the offending agent so let's
just<00:04:42.050> write<00:04:42.199> here<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.500> treatment<00:04:42.949> TX<00:04:43.820> for

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
just write here the treatment TX for

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.090 
just write here the treatment TX for
treatment<00:04:44.479> is<00:04:44.979> no<00:04:46.120> alcohol<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.630> alcohol<00:04:48.110> can

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
treatment is no alcohol and alcohol can

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.050 
treatment is no alcohol and alcohol can
be<00:04:49.190> abbreviated<00:04:49.460> by<00:04:49.910> EtOH<00:04:50.690> for<00:04:51.139> ethanol<00:04:52.060> but

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
be abbreviated by EtOH for ethanol but

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.210 
be abbreviated by EtOH for ethanol but
that's<00:04:53.240> not<00:04:53.419> fair<00:04:53.830> what<00:04:54.830> if<00:04:54.949> this<00:04:55.039> patient

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that's not fair what if this patient

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.490 
that's not fair what if this patient
just<00:04:55.520> wants<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.789> have<00:04:55.970> one<00:04:56.419> or<00:04:56.690> two<00:04:56.840> glasses<00:04:57.020> of

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
just wants to have one or two glasses of

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.100 
just wants to have one or two glasses of
wine<00:04:57.680> socially<00:04:58.340> but<00:04:58.520> avoid<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.570> alcohol

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
wine socially but avoid this alcohol

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.060 
wine socially but avoid this alcohol
induced<00:05:00.680> flush<00:05:01.370> well<00:05:02.560> some<00:05:03.560> research<00:05:03.919> has

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
induced flush well some research has

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.960 
induced flush well some research has
shown<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:05.120> treat<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.539> we<00:05:06.349> can<00:05:06.530> use

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
shown that to treat it we can use

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.610 
shown that to treat it we can use
antihistamines<00:05:07.970> we<00:05:08.240> know<00:05:08.360> histamines<00:05:09.020> cause

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
antihistamines we know histamines cause

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.430 
antihistamines we know histamines cause
the<00:05:10.280> flush<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.389> we<00:05:11.539> can<00:05:11.690> use<00:05:11.870> antihistamines

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
the flush so we can use antihistamines

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:20.710 
the flush so we can use antihistamines
to<00:05:13.220> treat<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:13.880> anti<00:05:15.460> histamines<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:19.720> the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
to treat it so anti histamines and the

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.659 
to treat it so anti histamines and the
one<00:05:20.870> most<00:05:21.110> commonly<00:05:21.590> used<00:05:21.889> by<00:05:22.070> people<00:05:22.130> is

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
one most commonly used by people is

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.140 
one most commonly used by people is
something<00:05:23.030> called<00:05:23.300> cimetidine<00:05:24.080> which<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.800> an

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
something called cimetidine which is an

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.870 
something called cimetidine which is an
h2<00:05:26.150> blocker<00:05:26.870> so<00:05:27.770> let's<00:05:27.919> just<00:05:28.070> rights<00:05:28.690> man<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:30.710> D

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.760 

that's<00:05:34.930> different<00:05:35.930> than<00:05:36.139> diphenhydramine

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
that's different than diphenhydramine

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.629 
that's different than diphenhydramine
which<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:37.849> an<00:05:38.000> h1<00:05:38.440> blocker<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:40.340> you<00:05:40.490> could

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
which is an h1 blocker but you could

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.060 
which is an h1 blocker but you could
actually<00:05:40.820> probably<00:05:41.449> use<00:05:41.720> both<00:05:42.139> I<00:05:42.530> did<00:05:42.889> see<00:05:43.039> a

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
actually probably use both I did see a

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.469 
actually probably use both I did see a
paper<00:05:43.310> which<00:05:43.550> talked<00:05:43.789> about<00:05:43.910> both<00:05:44.270> some

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
paper which talked about both some

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.360 
paper which talked about both some
editing<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.930> diphenhydramine<00:05:45.740> used

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
editing and diphenhydramine used

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.360 
editing and diphenhydramine used
together<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:48.229> if<00:05:48.530> you<00:05:48.620> took<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:48.919> before

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
together and that if you took it before

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.240 
together and that if you took it before
you<00:05:49.520> started<00:05:49.880> drinking<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:51.169> would<00:05:51.380> decrease

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
you started drinking you would decrease

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.870 
you started drinking you would decrease
the<00:05:52.310> flushing<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.060> your<00:05:53.180> face<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:53.630> things<00:05:54.380> like

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
the flushing in your face so things like

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.820 
the flushing in your face so things like
you<00:05:55.880> know<00:05:55.910> pepcid<00:05:56.360> ac<00:05:56.449> or<00:05:56.780> zantac<00:05:57.289> might<00:05:57.620> help

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
you know pepcid ac or zantac might help

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.240 
you know pepcid ac or zantac might help
here

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
here

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.450 
here
that's<00:05:58.639> a<00:05:58.880> h2<00:05:59.810> blockers<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.889> other<00:06:01.070> thing<00:06:01.340> is

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
that's a h2 blockers the other thing is

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.210 
that's a h2 blockers the other thing is
that<00:06:01.610> we<00:06:01.699> know<00:06:01.900> prostaglandins<00:06:02.900> cause<00:06:03.260> some

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
that we know prostaglandins cause some

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.700 
that we know prostaglandins cause some
of<00:06:04.310> this<00:06:04.460> flushing<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.270> so<00:06:05.990> something<00:06:06.680> that

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
of this flushing and so something that

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.920 
of this flushing and so something that
inhibits<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.610> production<00:06:07.930> of

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
inhibits the production of

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.730 
inhibits the production of
prostaglandins<00:06:09.140> is<00:06:09.979> our<00:06:10.130> good<00:06:10.340> old

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
prostaglandins is our good old

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.920 
prostaglandins is our good old
and<00:06:10.860> aspirin<00:06:13.819> and<00:06:14.819> so<00:06:15.360> let's<00:06:15.539> just<00:06:15.690> write<00:06:15.810> your

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
and aspirin and so let's just write your

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.219 
and aspirin and so let's just write your
aspirin<00:06:16.849> decreases<00:06:17.849> the<00:06:18.180> production<00:06:18.930> of

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
aspirin decreases the production of

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:26.390 
aspirin decreases the production of
prostaglandins<00:06:24.470> so<00:06:25.470> this<00:06:25.620> is<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.889> part<00:06:26.160> 1<00:06:26.370> of

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
prostaglandins so this is the part 1 of

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.680 
prostaglandins so this is the part 1 of
our<00:06:26.550> lecture<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.090> is<00:06:27.150> really<00:06:27.569> the

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
our lecture this is really the

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.770 
our lecture this is really the
underlying<00:06:28.169> principles<00:06:28.979> of<00:06:29.190> asianglow<00:06:29.970> so<00:06:30.660> we

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
underlying principles of asianglow so we

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.450 
underlying principles of asianglow so we
know<00:06:30.870> that<00:06:30.900> one<00:06:31.289> third<00:06:31.590> of<00:06:31.680> East<00:06:31.889> Asians<00:06:32.280> the

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
know that one third of East Asians the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.689 
know that one third of East Asians the
Japanese<00:06:32.970> the<00:06:33.180> Koreans<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:34.620> Taiwanese<00:06:35.130> they

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
Japanese the Koreans the Taiwanese they

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.249 
Japanese the Koreans the Taiwanese they
get<00:06:35.880> this<00:06:36.030> flushing<00:06:36.569> and<00:06:36.750> it's<00:06:36.840> not<00:06:36.990> a<00:06:37.020> result

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
get this flushing and it's not a result

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.529 
get this flushing and it's not a result
of<00:06:37.530> alcohol<00:06:38.310> but<00:06:38.580> it's<00:06:38.729> a<00:06:38.849> result<00:06:39.240> of<00:06:39.419> this

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
of alcohol but it's a result of this

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.330 
of alcohol but it's a result of this
buildup<00:06:40.080> of<00:06:40.229> something<00:06:40.560> called<00:06:40.710> acetaldehyde

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
buildup of something called acetaldehyde

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.629 
buildup of something called acetaldehyde
and<00:06:41.819> this<00:06:42.479> leads<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.530> release<00:06:44.370> of

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
and this leads to the release of

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.850 
and this leads to the release of
histamine<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:45.300> prostaglandins<00:06:45.539> which<00:06:46.530> are

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
histamine and prostaglandins which are

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.730 
histamine and prostaglandins which are
vasodilators<00:06:47.569> more<00:06:48.569> blood<00:06:48.810> goes<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.050> the<00:06:49.259> skin

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
vasodilators more blood goes to the skin

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.559 
vasodilators more blood goes to the skin
we<00:06:49.949> are<00:06:50.069> getting<00:06:50.340> flushing<00:06:50.849> and<00:06:51.030> the

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
we are getting flushing and the

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.570 
we are getting flushing and the
treatment<00:06:51.960> for<00:06:52.139> it<00:06:52.199> is<00:06:52.349> one<00:06:52.590> avoid<00:06:53.130> alcohol

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
treatment for it is one avoid alcohol

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.689 
treatment for it is one avoid alcohol
but<00:06:54.150> -<00:06:54.419> we<00:06:54.990> can<00:06:55.139> use<00:06:55.250> antihistamines<00:06:56.250> to<00:06:56.460> block

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
but - we can use antihistamines to block

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.670 
but - we can use antihistamines to block
the<00:06:56.880> histamine<00:06:57.509> effect<00:06:57.840> or<00:06:58.050> we<00:06:58.500> can<00:06:58.650> use

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
the histamine effect or we can use

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.330 
the histamine effect or we can use
aspirin<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.759> decrease<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.419> amount<00:07:00.659> of

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
aspirin to decrease the amount of

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.939 
aspirin to decrease the amount of
prostaglandins<00:07:02.840> so<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:03.930> next<00:07:04.139> question<00:07:04.409> that

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 
prostaglandins so the next question that

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.550 
prostaglandins so the next question that
a<00:07:05.099> patient<00:07:05.550> might<00:07:05.669> ask<00:07:05.880> you<00:07:06.120> is<00:07:06.300> doctor<00:07:06.840> why<00:07:07.500> is

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
a patient might ask you is doctor why is

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.860 
a patient might ask you is doctor why is
this<00:07:08.039> happening<00:07:08.639> to<00:07:08.970> me<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:09.630> it's<00:07:09.810> not

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
this happening to me but it's not

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.620 
this happening to me but it's not
happening<00:07:10.229> to<00:07:10.740> my<00:07:10.919> asian<00:07:11.520> wife<00:07:11.699> or<00:07:12.240> to<00:07:12.479> my

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
happening to my asian wife or to my

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.540 
happening to my asian wife or to my
Asian<00:07:13.050> friends<00:07:13.080> and<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.949> real<00:07:14.099> question<00:07:14.490> is

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
Asian friends and the real question is

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.260 
Asian friends and the real question is
getting<00:07:14.729> at<00:07:14.969> is<00:07:15.150> why<00:07:15.810> do<00:07:15.870> some<00:07:16.620> people<00:07:17.270> get

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
getting at is why do some people get

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.080 
getting at is why do some people get
flushing<00:07:19.110> and<00:07:19.229> others<00:07:19.500> don't<00:07:20.009> and<00:07:20.219> that<00:07:20.310> leads

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
flushing and others don't and that leads

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.020 
flushing and others don't and that leads
us<00:07:21.240> into<00:07:22.340> pharmacogenomics<00:07:23.340> and<00:07:23.610> something

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
us into pharmacogenomics and something

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.330 
us into pharmacogenomics and something
called<00:07:24.240> enzymatic<00:07:25.219> polymorphisms

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
called enzymatic polymorphisms

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.100 
called enzymatic polymorphisms
and<00:07:26.610> that's<00:07:27.120> what<00:07:27.240> we're<00:07:27.389> gonna<00:07:27.509> do<00:07:27.750> in<00:07:27.990> the

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.110 
and that's what we're gonna do in the

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.620 
and that's what we're gonna do in the
next<00:07:28.289> lecture
