I'll heat up the basic premise here is
it's<00:04:32.919> not<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:33.280> much<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.580> fish<00:04:33.760> as<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
it's not so much the fish as it is the

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.940 
it's not so much the fish as it is the
stuffing<00:04:34.840> right<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.500> has<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.680> be<00:04:35.800> at

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
stuffing right there has to be at

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.170 
stuffing right there has to be at
certain<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.460> that's<00:04:36.580> not<00:04:36.669> one<00:04:36.850> of<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.060> big

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
certain and that's not one of the big

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.060 
certain and that's not one of the big
mistakes<00:04:37.330> people<00:04:37.720> make<00:04:37.900> when<00:04:38.350> stuffing<00:04:38.830> fish

mistakes people make when stuffing fish

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.680 
mistakes people make when stuffing fish
is<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.460> they<00:04:39.640> take<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.970> out<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.540> they

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
is that they take it out of and they

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.320 
is that they take it out of and they
panic<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.919> stuffing<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.460> ice<00:04:42.760> cold<00:04:43.090> on
