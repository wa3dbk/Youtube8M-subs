00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 Hello everyone often happens when you repair 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 lost shape let's say wing and you don't 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.450
 know how to do it because in shape on 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 modern cars are quite complex 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.379
 there are how to make an example here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.239
 I have now incomprehensible how it should be 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.739
 wing shape 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.280
 you can of course put a bomber 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.280
 Bumper bumper is not always 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.010
 whole he, too, is damaged by the whole 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.550
 bumper also find problems should happen 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.040
 in general, you need to make a wing with nothing 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.500
 how best to do this best to do 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.460
 if you make a pattern a pattern you 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 can make 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 let's say under the left side in this 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.110
 here, the wing here is completely intact and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.440
 and we can make some templates 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 so the cow in this case I am now 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.530
 I will show how I will make a template here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.600
 on this part of the wing 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.330
 for this trick well, nothing is needed 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.980
 it is enough to have an ordinary 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.620
 compass but I have in my garage 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.160
 so here take an accurate compass on 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.130
 to metal 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.960
 can take ordinary church no matter 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.020
 the main thing that you can here this 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.400
 distance regulated and now we start 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 he will show how to do to take 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.550
 ordinary cardboard in this case 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.770
 I have the cardboard there is usually of 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.050
 boxes and now take the present by 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 silver 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.979
 on the bottom now also does not matter here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 curve side any become 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.940
 you take fancy and now take 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 shtangel your compass is more accurate and like this 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.120
 here spend 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:31.530
 and we got here 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.200
 barely visible thread profile wing now 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.040
 you take prune and check 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.440
 it fits or not I cut out 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.280
 now what is outlined and now possible 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.510
 attach and see what we have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.109
 it turns out here we see the form we have 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 fits perfect 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.950
 the best course to take for this not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.950
 corrugated cardboard that's how I took 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.049
 because it's corrugated soft not 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 very good for in this case me 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.190
 there was nothing else so i'm all 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.040
 decided to use one like that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.709
 better to use the gasket 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.579
 cardboard which has not corrugated 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.430
 structure 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.970
 but solid and it's tough enough 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.590
 tight enough also you can 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.150
 make absolutely any wing shape 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 absolutely that is any profile example 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.470
 a down 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.480
 right here make a profile you also 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.870
 You can here sharpeners and cut pattern 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.900
 for this you only have one 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.989
 important feature to notice and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.180
 mark the layout of this template on 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.480
 tom wing on which you will do 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.609
 first there is a markup done here 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.819
 pencil or marker does not matter 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.879
 than in this place outlined 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.370
 circumcised transferred to the other side on 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.250
 the same distance you marked the same 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.180
 very points and compared with what you have 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.150
 it turns out 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.720
 You can also here that is, in any part 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.930
 wing and also can also be attributed and 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.540
 I'm already in those places where the complex form 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.640
 there feel free to make a pattern and this 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.329
 cardboard and manufacturing will take there 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.130
 literally five minutes you have a wing profile 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.620
 let's say at the door you no longer need 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.970
 strongly guess anyway though 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:32.550
 would having a pattern you can do not 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:35.640
 very accurate but as accurate as possible 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.280
 it is said together to say trite nobody 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.670
 will not compare the left right side 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.500
 although there are such things but deviation 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.300
 it will be so insignificant that this 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.300
 the specialist will not even notice 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.490
 but if you do it all by the eye 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.350
 then you may have significant 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.860
 deviation which may even notice 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.580
 not specifically so use 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.430
 templates 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.930
 I often use them pretty much 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.020
 just not always show this video 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.090
 not to ask 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.210
 3 bites now decided to share this 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:14.050
 I hope she will also give you information 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.050
 Hello everyone, good luck
