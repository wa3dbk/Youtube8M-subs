00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.230
 m 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.950
 he 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.950
 at 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.680
 is everyone is dark to you auch 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.600
 finds himself for a new life of 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.010
 geek on layer blackhawks 2 in 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.080
 multiplayer to get out of all the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.300
 map so to start the click you 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.190
 you have to be two players puma plays 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.489
 your friend with my bow jersey account at 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.949
 z 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.960
 you will go to my profile and on 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.120
 my player chain and you go 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.550
 load the game mode that will be called 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.650
 teleport english so once that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.239
 you have loaded the game mode you 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.710
 will you put yourself in the team if he 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.300
 so all players will have to go 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.489
 put in the team if he team 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.059
 light blue and after you can launch 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.700
 the part 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.739
 so once the game started a player 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.230
 will have to change the team and get on 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.449
 in mercenary teams and once our 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.090
 mercenaries normally you'll see 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.970
 your buggy weapon she will go back end 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.860
 so that's quite normal and by the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.930
 following you will normally see the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.420
 two flags to capture we do not you 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.460
 had captured both flags and by 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.979
 magic that offered a bug left to do of 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 the dike xd so you go very 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.149
 quickly unlock your dragon fire 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 which will really serve to realize the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.860
 gleeks and once you have 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.899
 unlocked your and fire and ben you 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.310
 go first put your work 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.289
 fire in years in the map 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.259
 once the drama fire outside the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.119
 card your friend will have to make starts 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.550
 change the team he will get in 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.319
 mercenary team like you except is not going 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 not choose his class he will do it have 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.610
 they to redo stark 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.289
 she will put her team and i 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.720
 this time one will choose a class 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.849
 and it's going the teleported out of the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 map so a fandor of the map and 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.050
 hand you'll see he's at the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.160
 third person is normally he does not 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.520
 can not move it's quite 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.440
 normal 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.110
 you will have to destroy your dark 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.849
 fire and you will change the team you 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.860
 and you will put yourself a team that 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.729
 that normally a team i that you 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.590
 do not have weapons 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.180
 so you're going to have to change the team 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.040
 again and you are going to 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.480
 put a mercenary team so 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.489
 normally a mercenary team you 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.349
 go have your weapon and ammo 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.330
 you just have to ask your killer 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.739
 tactical is your friend to do the same 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.540
 year that you so he's going to have to 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.430
 go to multiple mercenaries and 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.219
 Norman he will not have weapons and after 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.260
 he will go on a team i that he will have 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.610
 his weapon and he will be able to pose his 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.690
 assertion taxi 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.010
 so once we get out of there because 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.569
 so much you can go to the front 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.030
 alive because snap's taste of 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.640
 aftermath is really big thanks to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.319
 dragons fire you will be able to go where 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.299
 you want that above the 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.500
 map or on houses or outside of 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.940
 the map 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.709
 in this video I will show in 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 somehow a complication as early as 8 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.099
 hours this morning because I want to do 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.069
 all multiplayer maps of black ops 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.170
 of themselves the mapaq revolution at least 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.970
 and ben you will be where to go out 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.739
 so I'm going to show you 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.690
 where I went out but it's 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.010
 possible to go out to any 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.049
 place outside the map 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.120
 so after that it will be up to you to find the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.500
 best place where they took me out there 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.280
 I love you just created places 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.750
 where it is possible 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.310
 after that for sure he may have 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.349
 other places that are even better 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.750
 than what I'm showing you right now 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.569
 in the video so I may have hurt 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.030
 explained the tutorial to achieve the glick 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.650
 it's sure that by explaining a glitch 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 also difficult out loud 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.879
 it's not easy so I'll put a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.349
 tutor in the description so that the 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.970
 people who did not understand my 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.430
 count laughed and well you have just to 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.380
 is in the instruction to achieve 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.660
 the glitch I'll explain them to you in 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.519
 end of video so somehow 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.410
 in this video as could have seen 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.359
 we can even go on the roof of the ide 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.519
 jaked on the houses and where you go 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.349
 really be able to go where you have 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.359
 not want any maps 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.310
 so it's possible to make the blick 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.930
 ch with a missile and storm so in 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.209
 somehow but if he is out of minogue 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.160
 would be right to put it and lyon where 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.349
 taf map is your friend is going to have 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.329
 quickly and had deported me in 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.639
 changing guides it is possible to 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.500
 realize it also with an adav and even 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.480
 a lot of stars but for now 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.160
 is taking a new barrier so we 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.070
 so dies the best way for 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.630
 the moment it is with the dragon fire so 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.669
 I quickly explain to you the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 glitch for people who will not have 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.400
 may not be understood 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.229
 so it's really very simple in 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.160
 somehow you would like first of all 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.070
 added my account 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.570
 ag and harkat z i will put the nickname of a 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.820
 description or same game but crehin 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.810
 comments to show you my 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.849
 second count is a tale 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.430
 secondary who is part of my team has 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.260
 handed bleaching so you go oiled 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.030
 wrong i will accept everyone 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.310
 once you have added me you 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.560
 go on player machine parts 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.800
 custom and you're going to go 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.540
 TV two game modes door English 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.370
 so once you've taken it you 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.290
 had it loaded and so you'll just 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.820
 to invite a friend to you because he 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.430
 would have to be two to achieve the 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.980
 glitch your friend and you yourself are going 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.690
 do l or r 1 to change the team 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.510
 before the game is announced because 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.760
 that it will be necessary to be in a team if it 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.930
 of yesterday the light blue team after you 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.150
 you can start the game 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.560
 once the party is launched, you 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.630
 are you going to change kits you are going to 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.000
 put in mercenary team normally 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.580
 your weapon will get bugged and he'll stay whose 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.620
 your head and after you'll just have to 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.510
 capture the flags to make the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.430
 bigue xp once you have your 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.979
 money elsewhere you'll just have to 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.380
 place your friend outside the map 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.080
 will he change the team and will go in 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.820
 mercenary team is not going to choose from 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.950
 class so it's going to be right in 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.950
 spectator then he just has to do 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.840
 round and will make them start exchange the 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.290
 kits again she will go in 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.540
 team 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.030
 issa is this time he's going to choose a 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.919
 class and it's going teleported on your 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.450
 dragon fire during card 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.060
 so once he's out of the 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.010
 card normally it's seen to him he 'll be at 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.020
 the third person and he will not be able 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.300
 not move it will be completely normal 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.250
 you will have to change equipped 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.750
 you will go as a team 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.970
 issa and you will choose a class 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.919
 normally you have no weapons 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.020
 and so you'll just have to change 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.820
 again the team and you go 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.460
 put you in the mercenary types 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.860
 and this time and ben you will have your 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.560
 weapons your missions and would just like to 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.060
 ask your tactical insertion to be 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.310
 sure not to die and not to 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.419
 reappear in the map so that 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.400
 your friend can move 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.990
 once you have gone out the 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.360
 map and you're teleporting near 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.289
 of your friend he too will have 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.240
 change the team 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.130
 so normally he'll have to go in 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.990
 mercenary team he's going to flee a class 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.669
 he will not have internal weapons once and 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.889
 after they would just change them 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.169
 the team went in team i elora 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.970
 a tear and his missions and after 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.830
 tomorrow you can explore them on August 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.900
 hoffman from each of the two maps or 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.280
 go on any spot so 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.700
 the really very simple goal to 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.039
 achieve 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.450
 you just have to understand it so I 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.650
 would put a title in the description 40 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.000
 once people did not understand my 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.230
 comments harry and I simon 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.390
 secondary accounts so that all the 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.820
 world can take my mode of play in 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.890
 somehow buggy because on fashion 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.780
 of gia it's buggy because the six teams in 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.090
 catch-up flag normally it's not 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.190
 normal so somehow at the end of 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.720
 video I will show you how to 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.190
 watch a map game mode a lot 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.440
 from the subscriber asked me how 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.410
 save a game mode so you 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.420
 just have to go on player machine 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.230
 and you're going to load the blick stele 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.660
 by tingwick 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.740
 once you've loaded the mode of 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.930
 play well in the game 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.210
 you're going to change the rule and 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.550
 you go key on square and after that go 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.840
 it wants to keep our game modes that your 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.090
 shared files 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.800
 you just have to put the title that 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.570
 you want and you will have the game mode 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.280
 on your account and at least you 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.780
 prefer all sma authors 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.850
 quietly and even you can 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.650
 pass on the game mode to your friends 

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.290
