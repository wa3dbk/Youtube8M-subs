beach Jimmy a big so the story is that
our<00:00:19.740> tech<00:00:20.580> island<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> coming<00:00:21.720> instead<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
our tech island is coming instead of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679 
our tech island is coming instead of
Pirate<00:00:23.160> Island<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.850> don't<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.390> which

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
Pirate Island if you don't know which

Pirate Island if you don't know which
island<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:25.949> island<00:00:26.599> basically<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
island is which island basically the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.919 
island is which island basically the
Pirate<00:00:28.380> Island<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.550> 93<00:00:30.449> undersea

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
Pirate Island is the or 93 undersea

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.650 
Pirate Island is the or 93 undersea
basically<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> r9<00:00:32.369> 390<00:00:32.969> r9<00:00:33.570> 390<00:00:34.050> X<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.590> r9<00:00:35.660> 380

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
basically to r9 390 r9 390 X and r9 380

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.040 
basically to r9 390 r9 390 X and r9 380
x<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> Arctic<00:00:38.129> Island<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> our<00:00:39.050> 949

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
x and then the Arctic Island is our 949

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
x and then the Arctic Island is our 949
TX<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.739> 9<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.550> 19<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.059> r9<00:00:42.890> 480<00:00:43.890> X<00:00:44.520> basically

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
TX are 9 for 19 and r9 480 X basically

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.860 
TX are 9 for 19 and r9 480 X basically
so<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.350> rumor<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.600> AMD<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.719> be

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so the rumor is that AMD will be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
so the rumor is that AMD will be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
instead of using creep so I mean what

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
instead of using creep so I mean what
kind<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> real<00:01:02.670> trying<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> back<00:01:03.809> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
kind of this real trying to the back in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.190 
kind of this real trying to the back in
back<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:04.979> last<00:01:05.460> year<00:01:05.760> basically<00:01:06.210> invaded<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
back in last year basically invaded is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
back in last year basically invaded is
the<00:01:07.619> same<00:01:07.890> thing<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.880> didn't

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the same thing they really didn't

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
the same thing they really didn't
launched<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.930> duty<00:01:10.590> x<00:01:10.710> 800<00:01:11.310> series<00:01:11.490> rather<00:01:11.790> than

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
launched a duty x 800 series rather than

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.020 
launched a duty x 800 series rather than
10<00:01:12.299> launch<00:01:12.510> rockets<00:01:13.320> 9-under<00:01:13.950> city<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
10 launch rockets 9-under city and then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
10 launch rockets 9-under city and then
they<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.659> all<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.320> unreasonable<00:01:16.710> excuse

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they have all really unreasonable excuse

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
they have all really unreasonable excuse
basically<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> come

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
basically the problem was that come

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.730 
basically the problem was that come
while<00:01:19.650> GPU<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.729> already<00:01:21.119> mobile<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> GTX

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
while GPU they was already mobile a GTX

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
while GPU they was already mobile a GTX
eight<00:01:22.950> sixty<00:01:23.549> percent<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> mobile<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
eight sixty percent on the mobile so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
eight sixty percent on the mobile so
basically<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.100> launch<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> same<00:01:26.939> that's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
basically if you launch the same that's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
basically if you launch the same that's
the<00:01:27.390> processor<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.080> mean<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the processor I mean basically if you

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
the processor I mean basically if you
learnt<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.119> boat<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> same<00:01:31.020> time<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
learnt a boat at the same time we can

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
learnt a boat at the same time we can
understand<00:01:32.220> basically<00:01:32.700> them<00:01:32.880> while<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.360> GTX

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
understand basically them while the GTX

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.319 
understand basically them while the GTX
s60<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.560> already<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.130> back<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.939> year<00:01:35.970> before

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
s60 was already out back one year before

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.840 
s60 was already out back one year before
the<00:01:36.570> launching<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> 800<00:01:37.979> city<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the launching of that 800 city so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
the launching of that 800 city so
basically<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.570> were<00:01:39.630> thinking<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.229> they

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
basically they were thinking that they

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
basically they were thinking that they
are<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.460> mean<00:01:41.820> named<00:01:42.090> dead<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> takes

they<00:01:53.880> were<00:01:53.970> using<00:01:54.149> someone<00:01:54.540> else<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.930> bad<00:01:55.140> do

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
they were using someone else for bad do

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.370 
they were using someone else for bad do
I<00:01:55.770> mean<00:01:56.299> indicate<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> new
