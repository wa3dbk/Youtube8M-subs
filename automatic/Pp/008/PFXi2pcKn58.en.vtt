00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it's already you know something that i

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.210 
it's already you know something that i
plan<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.170> eventually<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.890> probably

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
plan to do eventually you know probably

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.890

later<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.820> line<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.299> Republican<00:01:57.810> or

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
later on down the line one Republican or

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.570 
later on down the line one Republican or
Democrat<00:01:58.290> neither<00:01:59.360> yeah<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:01.190> don't<00:02:02.190> go<00:02:02.340> either

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580

Democrat neither yeah I don't go either
either<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:04.140> doesn't<00:02:04.470> says<00:02:04.590> why<00:02:04.710> doesn't

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
either that doesn't says why doesn't

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.859 
either that doesn't says why doesn't
that<00:02:05.070> surprise<00:02:05.159> me<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.149> i<00:02:06.330> mean<00:02:06.479> i

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
that surprise me at this point i mean i

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350 
that surprise me at this point i mean i
think<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.860> there's<00:02:08.069> things<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.850> taken

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
think that there's things to be taken

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
think that there's things to be taken
from<00:02:09.420> each<00:02:09.600> party<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.170> both<00:02:10.350> do<00:02:10.590> well

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
from each party that they both do well

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040 
from each party that they both do well
but<00:02:11.100> i<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> most<00:02:12.390> part<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
but i think that for the most part it is

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.750 
but i think that for the most part it is
bigger<00:02:13.319> than<00:02:13.470> Republican<00:02:14.160> or<00:02:14.250> Democrat<00:02:14.640> is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
bigger than Republican or Democrat is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.150 
bigger than Republican or Democrat is
bigger<00:02:14.970> than<00:02:15.410> Christian<00:02:16.410> Muslim<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.950> bigger

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
bigger than Christian Muslim is bigger

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
bigger than Christian Muslim is bigger
than<00:02:17.370> male<00:02:17.850> female<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.630> bigger<00:02:18.840> than<00:02:18.930> black

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
than male female it's bigger than black

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.500 
than male female it's bigger than black
white<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:20.130> bigger<00:02:20.310> than<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> ten
