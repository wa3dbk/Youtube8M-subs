00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
years ago it's better than something

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.180

I guess the mental color they did change

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.180 
I guess the mental color they did change
that<00:02:28.840> they<00:02:29.049> made<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.230> little<00:02:29.440> darker<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.069> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
that they made a little darker like the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.430 
that they made a little darker like the
originals<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.819> that's<00:02:31.299> good

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
originals so that's good

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
the lace tips they got rid of the metal

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.720 
the lace tips they got rid of the metal
lace<00:02:35.500> tips<00:02:35.739> which<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.100> originals<00:02:36.489> did<00:02:36.609> not

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
lace tips which the originals did not

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.120 
lace tips which the originals did not
have<00:02:36.970> either<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.470> that's<00:02:38.620> another<00:02:38.859> good<00:02:39.100> thing

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
