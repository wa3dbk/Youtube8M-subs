00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 but if the development is or 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.540
 goldstar short at vain aurich and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.970
 so the hammer really does it for 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.490
 top sport brought at corresponding 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.590
 training for a good reason solid 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 training that requires time, of course 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 in a word , we took the trense 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 Now just a moment on the saddle 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 the saddle so you have to put that yes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 not on the shoulder puts that he 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.390
 right now he really is not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.230
 that's also very important 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.880
 that the saddle does not move 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.590
 at a further educated tracks 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 and I have experienced it with four-year-olds 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.850
 horses have instructors the saddle after 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 Rear with a preface 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.649
 but then the viewer was 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.510
 maybe the rider has that, too 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.210
 feel that he has the diet more in front of him 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.090
 but that has nothing to ride with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.710
 to do that is a self-deception that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 Roll in the ordinary education 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 the relative to direction being the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.339
 can be supported by the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 Absolutely you surely know something 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.390
 it is relative then it is the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 erection when out of the backhand 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 The horse is apparently required 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.450
 bent in the slope to something bigger 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 be so front with the focus 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.650
 of the horse towards the back 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 rheydter is relocated 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.119
 relative erection the absolute 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 Alignment is when the horse 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 behind it and the rider tried 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.380
 far away with his hand he drives 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 It takes a while to go up 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.530
 that's what you call absolute but then 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.960
 every time the rider is at the front 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.360
 bite upwards brings that though 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.189
 Horse lift your head up your throat 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 take up the back away so pushes 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.899
 big warning about this handling 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
 that will take a handful up 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.750
 to take up there to sit down 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 without having to move the to be considered 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.560
 attracts 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 the back of the movement center of the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.879
 horses they need to be more specific 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.209
 look at 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:15.540
 a professor stapler who also in 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.120
 Hanover and in victories and everywhere and 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.910
 also makes other lectures has the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 based on a series of pictures for me 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.680
 clearly made visible 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.360
 if the back is not right the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.819
 the rider does not swing back 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.140
 sit down and hand it over 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.330
 Leaning is not available 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.730
 Of course, sometimes it's very hard to 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.440
 the horse still has to recognize the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.890
 Based on one of the most important elements 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.860
 in training scala or sees the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:50.380
 whole story contrived circus moderately 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:53.200
 I have mine in my time as 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:57.220
 American national coach one 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.650
 she had a plus italo 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.260
 she was a circus rider 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.070
 and then she said that too 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.300
 strong trots go wonderful today 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.820
 usually they can not do that 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.160
 she can also be somewhere yes if that 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.200
 is ridden properly when the strong 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.660
 hit should be important over the back 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.110
 swing the rider with you 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.080
 so have a room handlein a stretch 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.030
 we are also in the right one 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.500
 Go on like this and then she has a round two 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.170
 ridden round and then she has herself 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.989
 the weather at the top packed like that 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 strongly driven from behind that he so 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.810
 really 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.810
 not faster than a work pace 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.540
 But his legs almost went over his ears 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.129
 but hit the bottom leg completely away 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.629
 for her to dismount said that 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.280
 We do not want to or will not 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.110
 the service net we do not want that and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.560
 The horse does not want the horse, either 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.329
 does not have to be spectacular 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.390
 eat your legs up until you can not 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.190
 more then afterwards but the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.900
 the hind leg no longer move too close 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.629
 get that is one of the most important 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.790
 things are agreed when the strong trot 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.549
 must prevail bridges action 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.819
 engagement behind it but the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.600
 stretching to the hand and a swinging 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.299
 back so now you have that with you 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.770
 the saddle is with this good 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:27.460
 So the following will happen to the saddle 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.340
 anyway, not the lumbar vertebra 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.169
 is brought there at the end of 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.729
 wait, if you look at this 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.590
 there are the side there of continued 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.510
 the horse is not only moving forward 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.400
 moved down but also like one 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.770
 snake sideways now gets too 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.060
 feel the saddle if the before good 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.530
 brings the saddle too much to the rear 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 The horse is tense in the back 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.240
 stiffened in the back 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.790
 and what makes it natural in 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.130
 stuck back in the front seemingly 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.540
 better third bigger third litter 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.340
 exuberance is so now we have 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.900
 but we walked long enough 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.430
 let map now let it out again 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.220
 Now they all have the reins 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.900
 step observes the training scale 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.979
 say for me, for example 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.979
 trust in the first place
