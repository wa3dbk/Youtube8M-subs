so here we have a very fun fuzz pedal
from<00:01:36.650> JHS<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:38.030> sort<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.450> derived<00:01:38.840> from<00:01:39.140> a

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
from JHS it is sort of derived from a

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.250 
from JHS it is sort of derived from a
classic<00:01:40.430> fuzz<00:01:41.060> pedal<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.570> has<00:01:41.690> been<00:01:41.840> used<00:01:42.080> on

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
classic fuzz pedal that has been used on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.670 
classic fuzz pedal that has been used on
countless<00:01:42.710> records<00:01:43.340> has<00:01:44.270> its<00:01:44.480> origins<00:01:44.990> with

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
countless records has its origins with

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.730 
countless records has its origins with
the<00:01:46.040> traditional<00:01:47.030> fuzz<00:01:47.750> face<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.260> circuit

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the traditional fuzz face a circuit

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.970 
the traditional fuzz face a circuit
however<00:01:49.610> JHS<00:01:50.360> has<00:01:50.540> gone<00:01:50.720> in<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.170> improved<00:01:51.740> a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
however JHS has gone in and improved a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.430 
however JHS has gone in and improved a
number<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.460> things<00:01:52.640> among<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.810> one<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.380> the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
number of things among that one of the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.810 
number of things among that one of the
biggest<00:01:54.680> improvements<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.220> they<00:01:55.640> have

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
biggest improvements is they have

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.460 
biggest improvements is they have
tripled<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.270> Headroom<00:01:56.690> or<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.260> overall

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
tripled the Headroom or the overall

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.100 
tripled the Headroom or the overall
volume<00:01:57.980> output<00:01:58.550> of<00:01:58.910> this<00:01:59.120> pedal<00:01:59.390> which<00:01:59.960> is

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
volume output of this pedal which is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.870 
volume output of this pedal which is
great<00:02:00.350> because<00:02:00.620> those<00:02:00.950> original<00:02:01.400> circuits

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
great because those original circuits

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.400 
great because those original circuits
were<00:02:02.330> lacking<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.990> Headroom<00:02:03.650> as<00:02:04.370> well<00:02:04.940> they've

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
were lacking in Headroom as well they've

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.889 
were lacking in Headroom as well they've
chose<00:02:06.410> hand<00:02:07.190> matched<00:02:07.670> germanium<00:02:08.300> transistors

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
chose hand matched germanium transistors

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.650 
chose hand matched germanium transistors
for<00:02:09.679> each<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:09.890> these<00:02:09.979> pedals<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.520> they<00:02:11.390> put

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
for each of these pedals and they put

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.880 
for each of these pedals and they put
the<00:02:12.560> bias<00:02:13.040> knob<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.110> pedal<00:02:15.440> which<00:02:15.740> is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the bias knob on on this pedal which is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.500 
the bias knob on on this pedal which is
a<00:02:15.920> great<00:02:16.160> feature<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:17.000> allows<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.450> to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
a great feature and it allows you to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.220 
a great feature and it allows you to
find<00:02:18.070> adjust<00:02:19.690> fine-tune<00:02:20.690> kind<00:02:21.050> of<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
find adjust fine-tune kind of the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.770 
find adjust fine-tune kind of the
germanium<00:02:21.560> transistor<00:02:22.220> gain<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.510> allows

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
germanium transistor gain and it allows

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.110 
germanium transistor gain and it allows
for<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.170> different<00:02:24.740> feel<00:02:25.190> with<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.520> pedal<00:02:25.850> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
for a different feel with this pedal and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.420 
for a different feel with this pedal and
so<00:02:27.110> super<00:02:27.680> cool<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.959> gonna<00:02:29.959> use<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.220> bridge

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so super cool and gonna use the bridge

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.220 
so super cool and gonna use the bridge
pickup<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.150> tele<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.690> I'm<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.050> gonna

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
pickup on this tele and I'm just gonna

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.620 
pickup on this tele and I'm just gonna
actually<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:34.459> was<00:02:34.760> playing<00:02:35.060> with<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.300> volume

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
actually I was playing with the volume

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.600 
actually I was playing with the volume
cranked<00:02:36.350> all<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> way<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> guitar<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
cranked all the way on the guitar and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.400 
cranked all the way on the guitar and
then<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.060> backed<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.510> off<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:38.810> slightly<00:02:39.020> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
then I backed it off just slightly and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.870 
then I backed it off just slightly and
it<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:39.830> cleans<00:02:40.250> up<00:02:40.400> really<00:02:40.550> really

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
it really really cleans up really really

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.699 
it really really cleans up really really
well<00:02:40.970> that's<00:02:41.390> another<00:02:41.840> incredibly<00:02:42.440> great

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
well that's another incredibly great

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.890 
well that's another incredibly great
characteristic<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.760> pedal<00:02:44.120> as<00:02:44.360> I'm<00:02:44.720> just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
characteristic of this pedal as I'm just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.330 
characteristic of this pedal as I'm just
gonna<00:02:45.050> do<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.590> I'll<00:02:45.800> start<00:02:46.190> with

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
gonna do that for you I'll start with

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.850 
gonna do that for you I'll start with
the<00:02:46.850> volume<00:02:47.209> cranked<00:02:47.989> all<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:48.320> open<00:02:48.739> on

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
the volume cranked all the way open on

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.590 
the volume cranked all the way open on
my<00:02:49.010> guitar<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.489> then<00:02:49.760> I'll<00:02:49.850> back<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.090> off<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
my guitar and then I'll back it off and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560 
my guitar and then I'll back it off and
I'm<00:02:50.720> only<00:02:51.050> backing<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.709> off<00:02:51.830> maybe<00:02:52.150> 10<00:02:53.150> 15

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
I'm only backing it off maybe 10 15

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.970 
I'm only backing it off maybe 10 15
percent<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.170> volume<00:02:54.350> knob<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.739> just<00:02:54.920> a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
percent on the volume knob so just a

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.390 
percent on the volume knob so just a
little<00:02:55.220> tiny<00:02:55.550> turn<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.870> cleans<00:02:57.400> right

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
little tiny turn and I get cleans right

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.100 
little tiny turn and I get cleans right
through<00:02:58.610> right<00:02:58.790> away<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.000> I'll<00:02:59.660> just<00:02:59.840> let<00:02:59.959> you

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
through right away so I'll just let you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.500 
through right away so I'll just let you
listen<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.590> again<00:03:00.800> here's<00:03:01.070> clean

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.380 

and<00:03:04.170> here's<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> pollinator<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:05.940> full

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
and here's the pollinator with full

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:25.640 
and here's the pollinator with full
volume

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.190 

and<00:03:25.769> now<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.060> backed<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.480> off<00:03:27.629> a<00:03:27.870> tiny

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and now I just backed it off a tiny

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:40.280 
and now I just backed it off a tiny
little<00:03:28.440> bit

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:56.600 

and<00:03:40.800> we'll<00:03:40.920> crank<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.430> all<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.580> way<00:03:41.700> again

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.320 

you

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.750 

so<00:04:00.330> as<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:00.959> hear<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.890> cleans<00:04:02.489> up

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
so as you can hear it cleans up

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.660 
so as you can hear it cleans up
incredibly<00:04:03.269> well<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:03.930> just<00:04:04.489> touching<00:04:05.489> back

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
incredibly well with just touching back

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.789 
incredibly well with just touching back
a<00:04:05.700> little<00:04:06.000> bit<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.299> your<00:04:06.540> volume<00:04:06.900> knob<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.650> your

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
a little bit on your volume knob on your

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.539 
a little bit on your volume knob on your
guitar

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
guitar

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.729 
guitar
another<00:04:09.120> thing<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.450> enabling<00:04:09.930> tripling<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
another thing that enabling tripling the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.110 
another thing that enabling tripling the
Headroom<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.099> this<00:04:11.220> pedal<00:04:11.459> does<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.849> it

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
Headroom in this pedal does is it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.820 
Headroom in this pedal does is it
enables<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.900> use<00:04:13.049> some<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.590> lower

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
enables you to use some of the lower

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.599 
enables you to use some of the lower
range<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.510> fuzz<00:04:15.750> dial<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.380> fuzz<00:04:17.130> knob<00:04:17.370> and

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
range of the fuzz dial or fuzz knob and

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.670 
range of the fuzz dial or fuzz knob and
so<00:04:18.120> I'm<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.419> gonna<00:04:18.570> let<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.079> listen<00:04:19.410> a

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
so I'm just gonna let you listen a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.390 
so I'm just gonna let you listen a
little<00:04:19.979> bit<00:04:20.070> there<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.889> sort<00:04:23.310> of

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
little bit there and this is sort of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.189 
little bit there and this is sort of
maybe<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.669> setting<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.360> you're<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> little<00:04:25.110> bit

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
maybe a setting if you're a little bit

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.650 
maybe a setting if you're a little bit
afraid<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:26.340> too<00:04:26.820> much<00:04:26.940> fuss<00:04:27.300> maybe

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
afraid to have too much fuss maybe

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.450 
afraid to have too much fuss maybe
you're<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.229> want<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.470> get<00:04:28.590> into<00:04:28.860> fuzz<00:04:29.100> pedals

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
you're just want to get into fuzz pedals

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.550 
you're just want to get into fuzz pedals
this<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.300> setting<00:04:30.720> that's<00:04:30.840> definitely<00:04:31.530> a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
this is a setting that's definitely a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.409 
this is a setting that's definitely a
little<00:04:31.710> bit<00:04:31.800> more<00:04:31.949> mild<00:04:32.220> like<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.880> little<00:04:33.300> bit

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
little bit more mild like a little bit

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.510 
little bit more mild like a little bit
more<00:04:33.449> kind<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.470> like<00:04:34.650> an<00:04:34.740> over<00:04:34.949> driven<00:04:35.250> kind<00:04:35.430> of

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
more kind of like an over driven kind of

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.439 
more kind of like an over driven kind of
a<00:04:35.580> tone<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.660> not<00:04:36.900> as<00:04:37.110> much<00:04:37.710> fuzz<00:04:38.190> as<00:04:39.150> this

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
a tone and not as much fuzz as this

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.029 
a tone and not as much fuzz as this
pedal<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.840> really<00:04:40.050> capable<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:40.889> it's<00:04:41.010> a

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
pedal is really capable of but it's a

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.890 
pedal is really capable of but it's a
great<00:04:41.160> entrance<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:41.850> gateway<00:04:42.270> into<00:04:42.720> fuzz

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
great entrance or gateway into fuzz

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:56.540 
great entrance or gateway into fuzz
pedals<00:04:43.289> so

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.810 

you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.970 

so<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.870> can<00:05:04.990> hear<00:05:05.170> there<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.560> would<00:05:05.710> be<00:05:05.740> a

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
so you can hear there that would be a

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.150 
so you can hear there that would be a
really<00:05:06.340> really<00:05:06.850> really<00:05:07.030> mild<00:05:07.360> fuzz<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.160> it's

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
really really really mild fuzz and it's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.790 
really really really mild fuzz and it's
not<00:05:09.430> too<00:05:09.700> much<00:05:09.820> or<00:05:10.060> too<00:05:10.180> abrasive<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.870> just

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
not too much or too abrasive and just

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.360 
not too much or too abrasive and just
really<00:05:12.420> adding<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.600> extra<00:05:14.320> Headroom<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.280> this

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
really adding the extra Headroom to this

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.610 
really adding the extra Headroom to this
pedal<00:05:15.730> JHS<00:05:16.180> has<00:05:16.360> really<00:05:16.570> opened<00:05:16.900> up<00:05:16.960> sort<00:05:17.530> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
pedal JHS has really opened up sort of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.860 
pedal JHS has really opened up sort of
what<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.310> capable<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:19.000> I'm<00:05:19.480> gonna<00:05:19.660> crank

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
what it is capable of I'm gonna crank

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.840 
what it is capable of I'm gonna crank
the<00:05:20.020> fuzz<00:05:20.230> all<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.740> way<00:05:20.860> now<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.730> let

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
the fuzz all the way now and just let

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
the fuzz all the way now and just let
you<00:05:22.000> have<00:05:22.480> a<00:05:22.510> listen

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.570 

so<00:05:44.870> there<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:45.380> go<00:05:45.530> you<00:05:45.560> get<00:05:45.800> some<00:05:45.980> really<00:05:46.340> cool

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
so there you go you get some really cool

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.610 
so there you go you get some really cool
fuzz<00:05:47.420> tones<00:05:47.690> out<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.900> that<00:05:48.050> well<00:05:48.200> back<00:05:48.380> it<00:05:48.500> off

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
fuzz tones out of that well back it off

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.260 
fuzz tones out of that well back it off
a<00:05:48.650> little<00:05:48.770> bit<00:05:48.920> I'm<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:49.430> going<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.700> try<00:05:50.000> and

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
a little bit I'm just going to try and

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.240 
a little bit I'm just going to try and
demonstrate<00:05:50.450> what<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.110> bias<00:05:51.290> knob<00:05:51.650> does<00:05:51.950> and

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
demonstrate what the bias knob does and

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.670 
demonstrate what the bias knob does and
keep<00:05:53.090> in<00:05:53.210> mind<00:05:53.240> this<00:05:53.510> is<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.690> very<00:05:53.900> fine-tuned

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
keep in mind this is a very fine-tuned

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.890 
keep in mind this is a very fine-tuned
kind<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.220> adjustment<00:05:55.760> and<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:58.070> so<00:05:58.250> it's

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
kind of adjustment and and so it's

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.130 
kind of adjustment and and so it's
probably<00:05:59.900> a<00:05:59.960> little<00:06:00.230> bit<00:06:00.790> difficult<00:06:01.790> for<00:06:02.300> you

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
probably a little bit difficult for you

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.100 
probably a little bit difficult for you
to<00:06:03.350> notice<00:06:03.590> our<00:06:03.800> here<00:06:04.130> at<00:06:04.250> first<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:04.880> so<00:06:05.390> just

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
to notice our here at first and so just

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:18.930 
to notice our here at first and so just
going<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.290> start<00:06:07.160> with<00:06:07.430> it<00:06:07.640> where<00:06:07.970> it<00:06:08.090> is

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.630 

so<00:06:19.600> we<00:06:19.720> are<00:06:19.840> adjusting<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.950> germanium

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
so we are adjusting the germanium

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.530 
so we are adjusting the germanium
transistor<00:06:22.390> gain<00:06:22.690> right<00:06:23.200> now

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:07:06.029 

you

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.950 

so<00:07:07.039> there<00:07:07.520> you<00:07:07.940> have<00:07:07.970> it<00:07:08.240> folks<00:07:08.570> the

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
so there you have it folks the

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.990 
so there you have it folks the
pollinator<00:07:09.470> from<00:07:09.680> JHS<00:07:10.160> pedals<00:07:10.550> supercool

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
pollinator from JHS pedals supercool

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.330 
pollinator from JHS pedals supercool
fuzz<00:07:11.240> panel<00:07:11.600> and<00:07:11.840> there<00:07:12.500> is<00:07:12.650> an<00:07:12.800> incredible

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
fuzz panel and there is an incredible

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.159 
fuzz panel and there is an incredible
range<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.820> fuzz<00:07:14.060> that<00:07:14.090> is<00:07:14.509> available<00:07:14.690> in<00:07:15.050> it

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
range of fuzz that is available in it

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.320
