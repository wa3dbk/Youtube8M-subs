to close the back as you can see here
and<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.320> mentioned<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.890> an<00:03:08.130> 18-inch

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
and like I mentioned this is an 18-inch

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.540

from<00:03:11.790> dark<00:03:12.150> garden<00:03:12.570> yesterday<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.170> that's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
to do with the fact that it is an

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.900 
to do with the fact that it is an
off-the-rack<00:03:19.200> corset<00:03:19.769> not<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.610> made

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
for two hours which is what I did when I

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.180 
for two hours which is what I did when I
first<00:04:24.660> see

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
first see

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.450 
first see
in<00:04:25.280> debt<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:26.600> not<00:04:27.260> feel<00:04:27.470> uncomfortable<00:04:28.100> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
in debt and not feel uncomfortable and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.580 
in debt and not feel uncomfortable and
in<00:04:28.730> my<00:04:28.880> other<00:04:29.210> course<00:04:29.570> that's<00:04:29.750> like<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.140> 411

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
in my other course that's like the 411

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.060 
in my other course that's like the 411
or<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.310> 426<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.330> cotton<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.960> have<00:04:33.260> um

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
or the 426 in the cotton that I have um

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.440 
or the 426 in the cotton that I have um
I<00:04:35.500> it's<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.800> little<00:04:37.070> more<00:04:37.190> rigid<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.910> guess<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
I it's a little more rigid I guess I

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.940 
I it's a little more rigid I guess I
could<00:04:38.630> say<00:04:38.840> it's<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.200> little<00:04:39.470> more<00:04:39.650> durable

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
could say it's a little more durable

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.120 
could say it's a little more durable
because<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.970> layering<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.990> fabric<00:04:42.440> so

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
because of the layering of the fabric so

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.190 
because of the layering of the fabric so
you<00:04:43.160> know<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> can't<00:04:43.940> lay<00:04:44.090> down<00:04:44.120> or<00:04:44.540> relax<00:04:44.930> oh<00:04:45.170> I

where<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.250> bus<00:05:13.460> here<00:05:13.850> I<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.210> don't<00:05:14.750> know<00:05:14.870> if

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
where the bus here I I don't know if

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.020 
where the bus here I I don't know if
it's<00:05:15.170> just<00:05:15.350> if<00:05:15.770> it's<00:05:16.010> too<00:05:16.340> short<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.820> don't<00:05:16.970> know

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
it's just if it's too short I don't know

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.220 
it's just if it's too short I don't know
if<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.540> that<00:05:17.690> but<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:17.900> don't<00:05:17.960> know<00:05:18.140> if

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
it's too short for the channel I don't

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.230

think<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.350> does<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.190> does<00:05:22.370> tend<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:23.000> kind

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
think it is it does it does tend to kind

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.270 
think it is it does it does tend to kind
of<00:05:23.330> dig<00:05:23.570> into<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.990> sternum<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.500> little<00:05:24.860> bit<00:05:25.010> and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
of dig into the sternum a little bit and

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.060 
of dig into the sternum a little bit and
that<00:05:25.760> can<00:05:26.000> be<00:05:26.240> a<00:05:26.480> little<00:05:26.960> uncomfortable<00:05:27.290> but

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
that can be a little uncomfortable but

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.000 
that can be a little uncomfortable but
it's<00:05:28.250> not<00:05:28.460> it's<00:05:28.790> not<00:05:29.030> unbearable<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.590> I'm

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
it's not it's not unbearable so I'm

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.659 
it's not it's not unbearable so I'm
willing<00:05:31.370> to<00:05:31.640> overlook<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.330> um<00:05:33.400> but<00:05:34.400> like<00:05:34.520> I

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
willing to overlook that um but like I

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.750 
willing to overlook that um but like I
said<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:35.090> I'm<00:05:36.050> not<00:05:36.260> really<00:05:36.500> seeing<00:05:36.860> much<00:05:37.370> of<00:05:37.400> a

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
said I I'm not really seeing much of a

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.250 
said I I'm not really seeing much of a
problem<00:05:38.000> with<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.510> think<00:05:38.660> I<00:05:38.930> can<00:05:39.110> definitely

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
problem with it I think I can definitely

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.670 
problem with it I think I can definitely
cinch<00:05:39.890> down<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:40.160> little<00:05:40.430> more<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.960> is<00:05:42.230> it<00:05:42.500> is

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
cinch down a little more it is it is

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.730 
cinch down a little more it is it is
rather<00:05:42.950> stretchy<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:44.390> know<00:05:44.450> that<00:05:44.600> some<00:05:45.169> of

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
rather stretchy so I know that some of

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.770 
rather stretchy so I know that some of
the<00:05:45.830> bigger<00:05:46.010> size<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.550> do<00:05:46.790> want<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:47.240> kind<00:05:47.600> of

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
the bigger size you do want to kind of

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
the bigger size you do want to kind of
double<00:05:48.260> check<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.680> specs<00:05:48.980> to<00:05:49.280> make<00:05:49.460> sure<00:05:49.730> that

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
double check the specs to make sure that

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.500 
double check the specs to make sure that
it<00:05:50.540> doesn't<00:05:50.870> it's<00:05:51.320> not<00:05:51.530> -<00:05:51.890> it<00:05:52.730> will<00:05:52.910> be<00:05:53.060> too<00:05:53.300> big

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
it doesn't it's not - it will be too big

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.640 
it doesn't it's not - it will be too big
for<00:05:53.540> you<00:05:54.070> because<00:05:55.070> it<00:05:55.460> is<00:05:55.610> just<00:05:56.120> one<00:05:56.270> layer<00:05:56.900> it

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
for you because it is just one layer it

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.490 
for you because it is just one layer it
does<00:05:57.950> have<00:05:58.250> room<00:05:58.669> for<00:05:58.700> that<00:05:59.060> and<00:05:59.360> because<00:06:00.350> of

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
does have room for that and because of

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.180 
does have room for that and because of
the<00:06:00.800> material<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.490> it's<00:06:01.669> made<00:06:01.760> up<00:06:03.010> but<00:06:04.010> like

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
the material that it's made up but like
