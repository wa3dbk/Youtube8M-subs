00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
more potential for variation in how well

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.120 
systems its storage tanks its lines you
know<00:03:21.290> you'd<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.440> more<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> chance<00:03:21.799> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
know you'd have more of a chance of

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.339 
know you'd have more of a chance of

because you have a thats not well
maintained<00:03:26.930> then<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.319> would<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.500> having

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
maintained then you would have having

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.920 
maintained then you would have having
damage<00:03:28.190> because<00:03:28.519> you're<00:03:28.669> using<00:03:28.849> a<00:03:29.209> no<00:03:29.599> brand
