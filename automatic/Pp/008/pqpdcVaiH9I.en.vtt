hi I'm Tom chibi and I want to tell you
about<00:00:08.100> the<00:00:08.400> equi<00:00:08.820> breeze<00:00:09.059> line<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.540> trailers

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
about the equi breeze line of trailers

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.200 
about the equi breeze line of trailers
that<00:00:10.020> we've<00:00:10.230> created<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.730> why<00:00:12.000> we're

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
that we've created and and why we're

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.629 
that we've created and and why we're
very<00:00:12.510> very<00:00:12.629> excited<00:00:13.049> about<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.799> Nev<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.549> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
very very excited about it Nev and I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.090 
very very excited about it Nev and I
have<00:00:15.000> developed<00:00:15.629> this<00:00:15.780> idea<00:00:16.049> from<00:00:16.620> scratch

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
have developed this idea from scratch

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.070 
have developed this idea from scratch
because<00:00:17.310> we've<00:00:17.580> always<00:00:17.820> loved<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.660> idea<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
because we've always loved the idea of

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
because we've always loved the idea of
having<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> circulation<00:00:21.030> and<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
having a lot of circulation and a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.270 
having a lot of circulation and a
trailer<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.810> obviously<00:00:22.500> stock<00:00:22.920> style

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
trailer and obviously stock style

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.640 
trailer and obviously stock style
trailers<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:24.120> that<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.810> most<00:00:25.050> stock<00:00:25.230> trailers

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
trailers do that the most stock trailers

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.110 
trailers do that the most stock trailers
or<00:00:25.860> I<00:00:25.890> should<00:00:26.220> say<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:26.910> stock

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
or I should say a lot of the stock

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.520 
or I should say a lot of the stock
trailers<00:00:27.450> you've<00:00:27.570> seen<00:00:27.780> on<00:00:27.900> market<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.350> been

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
trailers you've seen on market have been

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.890 
trailers you've seen on market have been
converted<00:00:28.950> from<00:00:29.370> cattle<00:00:30.120> trailers<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:30.690> stock

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
converted from cattle trailers or stock

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.840 
converted from cattle trailers or stock
trailers<00:00:31.320> over<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.770> horse<00:00:31.950> trailer<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.820> he

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
trailers over the horse trailer so he

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
trailers over the horse trailer so he
never<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.570> quite<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.890> being<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
never really quite made it to being a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.239 
never really quite made it to being a
horse<00:00:35.370> trailer<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.450> we've<00:00:36.660> done<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
horse trailer but what we've done is

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.829 
horse trailer but what we've done is
develop<00:00:38.249> this<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> horse<00:00:39.329> trailer<00:00:39.570> right

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
develop this to be a horse trailer right

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.599 
develop this to be a horse trailer right
from<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> beginning<00:00:40.289> with<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.070> idea<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
from the beginning with the idea of

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.380 
from the beginning with the idea of
being<00:00:42.030> strong<00:00:42.690> safe<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> affordable<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
being strong safe and affordable and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
being strong safe and affordable and
i'll<00:00:45.780> show<00:00:45.839> you<00:00:46.019> what<00:00:46.230> i<00:00:46.260> mean<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.679> while

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
i'll show you what i mean by that while

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.819 
i'll show you what i mean by that while
we're<00:00:47.159> on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.429> outside<00:00:47.960> for<00:00:48.960> instance<00:00:49.260> this

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we're on the outside for instance this

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.489 
we're on the outside for instance this
has<00:00:50.159> only<00:00:50.460> two<00:00:50.789> slots<00:00:51.149> instead<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
has only two slots instead of a lot of

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.290 
has only two slots instead of a lot of
have<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:52.980> four<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.519> five<00:00:53.819> so<00:00:54.120> you've<00:00:54.269> got

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
have them four or five so you've got

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.910 
have them four or five so you've got
three<00:00:54.809> openings<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.379> give<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.589> lot<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
three openings will give a lot of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.919 
three openings will give a lot of
ventilation<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.909> look<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.210> tall<00:00:57.269> the<00:00:57.690> side

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
ventilation but look how tall the side

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.509 
ventilation but look how tall the side
wall<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> course<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.159> why<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
wall is and of course you know why that

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.669 
wall is and of course you know why that
is<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.059> course<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.870> can't<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.440> leg

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
is so of course really can't get a leg

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.670 
is so of course really can't get a leg
over<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> same<00:01:03.300> way<00:01:03.479> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.809> ramp<00:01:04.050> we

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
over it it's the same way on the ramp we

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
over it it's the same way on the ramp we
have<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> nice<00:01:05.159> tall<00:01:05.550> ramp<00:01:05.940> which<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> all

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
have a nice tall ramp which is all

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
have a nice tall ramp which is all
spring<00:01:06.840> loaded<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:08.070> horse<00:01:08.310> can't<00:01:08.579> really

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
spring loaded and a horse can't really

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.690 
spring loaded and a horse can't really
get<00:01:09.270> leg<00:01:09.509> up<00:01:09.719> over<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.950> hung<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
get leg up over it and get hung up on it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.550 
get leg up over it and get hung up on it
which<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.420> important<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> reason

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
which is very important and the reason

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.580 
which is very important and the reason
of<00:01:13.829> course<00:01:13.890> ramps<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.020> important

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of course ramps are so very important

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
of course ramps are so very important
and<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.369> want<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.149> good<00:01:18.479> ramp<00:01:18.719> because

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and you want I not a good ramp because

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
and you want I not a good ramp because
when<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.740> spring<00:01:20.100> loaded<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
when it's all spring loaded and has a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.139 
when it's all spring loaded and has a
nice<00:01:22.140> low<00:01:22.680> angle<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.700> horse<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
nice low angle to it so the horse is

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.029 
nice low angle to it so the horse is
basically<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.719> walking<00:01:25.320> over<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
basically just walking over into the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.100 
basically just walking over into the
trailer<00:01:26.369> rather<00:01:26.700> than<00:01:27.299> trying<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> climb<00:01:27.899> up

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
trailer rather than trying to climb up

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
trailer rather than trying to climb up
it<00:01:28.289> but<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.399> when<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> horse<00:01:29.909> walks

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it but as you can see when a horse walks

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
it but as you can see when a horse walks
out<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.840> ramp<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.649> eliminates<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
out a ramp just eliminates the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
out a ramp just eliminates the
possibility<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.570> horse<00:01:33.780> stepping<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
possibility of a horse stepping down and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
possibility of a horse stepping down and
sliding<00:01:35.520> under<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> back<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:38.719> now<00:01:39.719> as<00:01:39.899> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
sliding under the back of it now as you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.740 
sliding under the back of it now as you
can<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:41.219> you<00:01:41.250> look<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.600> not

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
can see when you look in here you're not

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.090 
can see when you look in here you're not
looking<00:01:43.109> at<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> stock<00:01:43.560> trailer<00:01:43.890> you're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
looking at the stock trailer you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
looking at the stock trailer you're
really<00:01:44.369> looking<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.000> horse<00:01:45.240> trailer<00:01:45.570> you've

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really looking at a horse trailer you've

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.490 
really looking at a horse trailer you've
got<00:01:46.289> all<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> padding<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.939> dividers<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
got all the padding the dividers you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
got all the padding the dividers you
have<00:01:49.679> what<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.039> call<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.429> safe<00:01:50.700> kick<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
have what we call the safe kick on the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.959 
have what we call the safe kick on the
wall<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.079> both<00:01:52.289> walls<00:01:52.619> most<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.640> all<00:01:53.759> these

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
wall on both walls most of all these

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.630 
wall on both walls most of all these
dividers<00:01:54.359> are<00:01:54.539> pretty<00:01:55.049> much<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> same

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
dividers are pretty much the same

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.800 
dividers are pretty much the same
concept<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:56.789> idea<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
concept an idea that we have in the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
concept an idea that we have in the
exosphere<00:01:58.140> trailer<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.429> course<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.820> all

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
exosphere trailer and of course it's all

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.260 
exosphere trailer and of course it's all
for<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.210> safety<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.810> ease<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.729> handling<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
for the safety and ease of handling and

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
for the safety and ease of handling and
the<00:02:03.539> comfort<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.499> horse<00:02:04.909> for<00:02:05.909> example<00:02:06.299> if

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the comfort of the horse for example if

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.940 
the comfort of the horse for example if
you<00:02:06.479> could<00:02:06.659> move<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.049> camera<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.590> closer

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
