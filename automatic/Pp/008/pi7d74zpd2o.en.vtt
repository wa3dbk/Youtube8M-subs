00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.620
 models of the 93 series can be done 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.590
 longer than 30 years on the model train 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.180
 rolling tracks in 1981, the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.510
 Replica of the former Prussian 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.480
 t14 the numbers scheme of reichs and 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.180
 Bundesbahn as series 93 0 to 3 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.740
 was led 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.440
 1995 brought the Austrian 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.229
 Manufacturer a new 93 out the her 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.130
 model in the successor of the 14 1 had 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.270
 or 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.740
 of the series 93 5 differ 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 the models are mainly by the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.150
 replicas of now two round steam 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.030
 and two angular sand flowers on the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.590
 boiler and the rounded side 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.800
 water tanks and a continuous 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.970
 Circular sheet metal This basic form was built by Rocco 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.209
 in different colors 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 threat and equipment variants the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.470
 now another as the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.500
 Machine with only two lamps in front and 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.050
 behind as a representative of the early 3 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.880
 before the db in the early fifties with 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 do not support the refitting on the part 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.970
 Signal began to impress the model 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:41.140
 elaborate detailing of the boiler only 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.280
 few lines are molded the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 Hand wheels are not broken 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 the rod is filigree as well as the wheel 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.780
 spokes the rods are euro 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.610
 of course moveable 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.790
 though quite on the right side 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.620
 wobbly the lighting is also in the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.320
 darkened room barely visible 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 there are better solutions today 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.310
 driving characteristics of the shown here 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 Model are at lowest gear 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.200
 not satisfying the noc prof 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.880
 slightly for the return must the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.870
 vaart regulator will continue to be turned on 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.360
 before being moved directly driven 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.920
 is only the second axis would be speech 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.690
 have matured mature 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.120
 the other wheels are going through the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.709
 rod taken with the change of 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.389
 direction of travel, the turn directly 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.910
 driven wheels slightly before that 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.590
 rod the other voters move the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.950
 fractional characteristics of this 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.379
 model insufficiently the 3 143 grams 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.810
 heavy lok made just 24 grams 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.360
 weight cups our rolls days before 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.970
 she began to hurl that lies in 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.069
 the chassis construction because no axle 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.660
 there is no height 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.470
 increased pressure on the two liable 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.900
 mature wheels 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.330
 This lasts while cheaper than 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.819
 a mobile ax storage and the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.650
 advantage that no wheel but there is one 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.750
 Freight train lok has to be able to do more 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.120
 especially if there is a slope 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.739
 to master 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.549
 The lok is a representative of the early 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.010
 3 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.430
 from 19.45 until the beginning of the 50s 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.430
 applies
