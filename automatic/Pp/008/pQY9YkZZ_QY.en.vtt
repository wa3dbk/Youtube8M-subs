00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.350 
again it was way too short and this came
in<00:06:49.680> like<00:06:49.889> at<00:06:50.219> a<00:06:50.280> point<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.639> a<00:06:50.759> waste<00:06:50.909> that<00:06:51.180> was

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
in like at a point of a waste that was

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.409 
in like at a point of a waste that was
just<00:06:51.479> made<00:06:51.599> it<00:06:51.719> too<00:06:51.870> short<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:52.849> then<00:06:53.849> I<00:06:53.879> figure

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
just made it too short and then I figure

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.420 
just made it too short and then I figure
out<00:06:54.509> the<00:06:54.599> name<00:06:54.750> of<00:06:54.870> this<00:06:54.990> one<00:06:55.199> is<00:06:55.349> I<00:06:55.710> think

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
out the name of this one is I think

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.330 
out the name of this one is I think
someone<00:06:56.669> was<00:06:56.759> 22<00:06:57.300> and<00:06:57.419> other<00:06:57.569> one<00:06:57.689> was<00:06:57.840> 25<00:06:58.340> but

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
someone was 22 and other one was 25 but

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.469 
someone was 22 and other one was 25 but
it's<00:06:59.639> a<00:06:59.759> kind<00:07:00.180> of<00:07:00.240> dark<00:07:01.189> cranberry<00:07:02.189> color<00:07:02.520> and

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
it's a kind of dark cranberry color and

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:05.209 
it's a kind of dark cranberry color and
there's<00:07:03.840> the<00:07:04.020> fit<00:07:04.289> was<00:07:04.409> really<00:07:04.650> weird<00:07:04.830> on<00:07:05.009> me

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:05.219 
there's the fit was really weird on me

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:07.010 
there's the fit was really weird on me
it<00:07:05.490> just<00:07:05.639> didn't<00:07:05.879> work<00:07:06.000> on<00:07:06.210> my<00:07:06.360> body<00:07:06.569> and<00:07:06.750> just

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
it just didn't work on my body and just

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.409 
it just didn't work on my body and just
made<00:07:07.139> me<00:07:07.259> look<00:07:07.529> like<00:07:07.590> really<00:07:08.069> just<00:07:08.279> like<00:07:08.430> so

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
made me look like really just like so

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:10.939
