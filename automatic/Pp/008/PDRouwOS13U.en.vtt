the<00:00:11.050> y-axis<00:00:12.040> and<00:00:12.430> the<00:00:12.730> x-axis<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:14.230> you<00:00:14.440> have

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
the y-axis and the x-axis and you have

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.320 
the y-axis and the x-axis and you have
to<00:00:14.740> pop<00:00:14.980> off<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:15.310> told<00:00:15.640> hey<00:00:15.820> what<00:00:16.059> do<00:00:16.119> you<00:00:16.150> what

okay so today I'm going to teach you how

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.050 
okay so today I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:32.250> backflip

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
to backflip

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.020 
to backflip
it's<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.170> quite<00:00:34.890> deceiving<00:00:35.460> tricks<00:00:35.730> lots

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's really quite deceiving tricks lots

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.690 
it's really quite deceiving tricks lots
of<00:00:36.150> creepers<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:37.070> backflip<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.430> going

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
of creepers think backflip you're going

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
of creepers think backflip you're going
upside<00:00:39.090> down<00:00:39.330> it's<00:00:40.080> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.560> hard<00:00:40.770> but

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
upside down it's going to be hard but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
upside down it's going to be hard but
that<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> completely<00:00:42.239> wrong

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that is completely wrong

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.220 
that is completely wrong
a<00:00:43.140> backflip<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.090> easiest<00:00:45.780> tricks

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a backflip is one of the easiest tricks

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
a backflip is one of the easiest tricks
you<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:46.950> need<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.220> use<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.489> edges

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you don't really need to use your edges

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
you don't really need to use your edges
on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.150> way<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> jump<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.440> using

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
on the way up to the jump you're using

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.110 
on the way up to the jump you're using
flat<00:00:50.100> face<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.180> requires<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> commitment

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
flat face all it requires is commitment

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.970 
flat face all it requires is commitment
100%<00:00:54.120> commitment<00:00:54.870> first<00:00:55.470> of<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.770> you're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
100% commitment first of all you're

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.890 
100% commitment first of all you're
going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> start<00:00:56.400> out<00:00:56.580> on<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.970> smallish<00:00:57.570> jump

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
going to start out on a smallish jump

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.140 
going to start out on a smallish jump
you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:58.890> into<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> jump<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.820> you

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
you know right into the jump and you

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.249 
you know right into the jump and you
need<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.480> rip<00:01:00.780> off<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.650> tail<00:01:01.950> and<00:01:02.250> look<00:01:02.760> back

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
need to rip off your tail and look back

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.990 
need to rip off your tail and look back
really<00:01:04.259> all<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.770> to<00:01:05.009> do<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.400> commit<00:01:05.820> it

really all you need to do is commit it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.690 
really all you need to do is commit it
to<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> rotation<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.290> smaller<00:01:07.800> jump<00:01:08.070> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
to the rotation on a smaller jump you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.510 
to the rotation on a smaller jump you
really<00:01:09.119> need<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.960> extra<00:01:10.259> wag<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.009> you<00:01:11.369> need

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really need that extra wag and you need

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.150 
really need that extra wag and you need
to<00:01:11.640> stay<00:01:11.850> nice<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.360> tight<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.380> hold<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
to stay nice and tight to hold it to

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.700 
to stay nice and tight to hold it to
speed<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:14.729> rotation<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.410> move<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
speed up that rotation when you move on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.040 
speed up that rotation when you move on
to<00:01:16.860> bigger<00:01:17.070> jumps<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.240> slow<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.630> your

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
to bigger jumps you can slow down your

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.740 
to bigger jumps you can slow down your
rotation<00:01:19.619> by<00:01:19.950> opening<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.570> good

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
rotation by opening out the really good

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
rotation by opening out the really good
thing<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.320> backflip<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.670> spot

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
thing about a backflip is you can spot

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
thing about a backflip is you can spot
your<00:01:24.119> landing<00:01:24.170> really<00:01:25.170> early<00:01:25.410> on<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
your landing really early on so if you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
your landing really early on so if you
feel<00:01:26.399> like<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.940> under<00:01:27.210> rotating<00:01:27.990> bring

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
feel like you're under rotating bring

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.859 
feel like you're under rotating bring
those<00:01:28.890> legs<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.520> hold<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.940> tight<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
those legs in and hold it tight and that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
those legs in and hold it tight and that
will<00:01:30.960> speed<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.470> rotation<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.910> you<00:01:33.119> feel

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
will speed up the rotation if you feel

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.359 
will speed up the rotation if you feel
like<00:01:33.539> you're<00:01:33.720> over<00:01:34.050> rotating<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.160> can

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
like you're over rotating you can

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.290 
like you're over rotating you can
stretch<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> out

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
stretch it out

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.260 
stretch it out
