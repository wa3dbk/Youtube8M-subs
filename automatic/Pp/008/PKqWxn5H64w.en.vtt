bondo<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.560> thing<00:02:00.830> was<00:02:01.569> you'd<00:02:02.569> probably<00:02:02.750> have

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
bondo this thing was you'd probably have

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.840 
bondo this thing was you'd probably have
less<00:02:03.170> than<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.470> other<00:02:03.590> guy<00:02:03.800> had<00:02:04.009> on<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.280> but

less than the other guy had on it but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.249 
less than the other guy had on it but
everything<00:02:05.119> gets<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.600> skim<00:02:05.899> of<00:02:06.050> filler

somewhere<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.140> guy<00:02:09.289> should<00:02:09.500> get

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
somewhere it's just the guy should get
