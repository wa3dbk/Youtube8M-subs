 new consequence do you believe us today with the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.280

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.750
 and yes we're cool four cool again today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 story it for you two of me two of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 each one true one so wrong 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.309
 your guess happy again the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.170
 comments as I told a true one 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.789
 one wrong and one bar and one 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.779
 wrong and the player not even short 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.439
 for example, comment on this 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.029
 can look like 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.170
 and yes at the end of the episode then come 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.910
 still the resolution which story 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.320
 was right and wrong and as I said 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 let say you like it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.449
 Of course you could be by 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.449
 in the description 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.890
 The last ones can also be super cool 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.660
 on 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.149
 I would say start with yours now 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.339
 first story so my first one 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.859
 story takes place between me 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.530
 and the buddy and that was us 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.909
 almost always about two years ago 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.289
 a lot of outdoors were together a lot 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.399
 and somehow wanted to 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.289
 times as a bit of action and action 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.430
 just have something cool and experience 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.559
 then we came up with the idea that here 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 close to us at a distance of just under one kilometer 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.970
 The company is about where they are so whole 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.580
 just like it so holzstämme 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.810
 bring it and then somehow like that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.539
 dry western coal like that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.069
 and that was finished was just shut up 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.140
 that means that there is no choice 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.300
 we knew that and he probably thought there 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.800
 somehow go so well or something and so 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.539
 look what's going on there and then 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.009
 So we have the sound up with stones 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.479
 So that's not a must you have 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.549
 unimaginable so big tower out 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.890
 glass or something smaller 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.270
 rundown company factory so and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.580
 We broke the fence that way 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.560
 with stones have come in and have 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 then so fire extinguisher boots 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.220
 we had such a beep that we did that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.509
 the fund knows from the supermarket that the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.950
 in there has no idea but so 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.599
 what did we have and have something like that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.220
 everything taken away and then have it 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.810
 just 100 meters from there always like that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.090
 stored and we have completely 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.349
 opened and one day we are then 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.940
 just come back and have 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.239
 just notice that the fence stops again 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.200
 to was and we think first time okay 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.519
 go first where we all ours 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.629
 have stored stuff they have the like 

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.310
 said to be a hundred yards away 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.720
 Just stored so we wanted so 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.239
 put our treasures there and us 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.019
 then money and that was all gone 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.090
 complete 

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:09.890
 and there was such a small one I do not know 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
 so not even the a4 and small piece of paper 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.830
 so cheap cheap and so easy with that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.180
 written on it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.800
 I'm not so sure anymore 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 sure what either was never 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
 on it again or not again one 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.810
 both said it was just like 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.849
 said already I would have buddy 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.510
 but yes, that's the whole thing 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.239
 expired 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.140
 that was my first story and yes me 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.790
 have a short time on twitter 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 Posted and then it happens too 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.659
 my first story and that was 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.940
 easily and that because I from 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.580
 my stadions münsterstraße below 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 1 VfB Stuttgart in the stadium so also depends 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.209
 in bowls as you might as far as to 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 can recognize and continue to maintain 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.959
 vip's vip lounge was against that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.389
 already a kind of friendship games 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.799
 test match so in the summer break so 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.540
 just before the start of the season and still has 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.790
 played live 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.670
 and a VIP lounge ticket 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.200
 gifts comes from somewhere and then 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.189
 I was there and in the VIP lounge 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.560
 are always so rit with food 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.079
 Drink our fucking yes there always goes 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.189
 So ours could not be really 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.409
 normal fan I say 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.000
 and then I was just in there then the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.409
 game runs a bit at once 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 so a few gimmicks so what 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.560
 means games you realize that you are so ok 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.739
 These dressed relatively well and so 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.389
 relatively tall muscular man I see that way 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.970
 Look carefully and think oh my god 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.200
 fact is gomez khedira and what I would be 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.299
 When will I have in any case then 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.799
 even met with them then 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.250
 Pictures taken autographs brought everything 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.930
 possible and he really wanted nice then 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.000
 wm images transferred to the pc so 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.340
 leaves of my parents and then is 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.139
 A few days before that is broken 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.730
 gone so the sd card has changed 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.959
 sort of dissolved the simple on the ass 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.730
 you could not rule the education 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.799
 I should have met and so we have 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.139
 really long sign autographs brought 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.790
 just watched the game together 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.470
 pictures taken and any 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.209
 fucking and then were the pictures 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.650
 Crash destroyed the goods now gone 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.400
 that's probably not going to be here anymore 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.590
 seems 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 So you right the player stopped 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.750
 not played the game because the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.389
 were spared or just because 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.840
 he plays two or so national team 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.549
 had 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.319
 it was just after the 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.099
 he became championship season software 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.139
 celebrating champions 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.859
 yes that was then my second 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.629
 Story my first to your second 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.120
 so my second story is going on 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.280
 from before I think that was about 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.560
 One year ago I was my father 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.580
 So I was mostly with a father 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.159
 when alone on vacation and 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.500
 or we are after 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:31.039
 greece that was spanish after 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.360
 spain flew somewhere in 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.830
 Such a blatant hotel was on everyone 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.510
 case quite strong but somehow can 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.659
 so let somehow immediately 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.000
 I know Aldi or something and continue 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.800
 and was to be normal all 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.960
 pretty cool room and now 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.880
 directly noticed that in a room 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.560
 next to us 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.180
 pretty woman was quite right 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.140
 handsome man so that's me 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.990
 I noticed directly and then was 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.320
 so that I wanted to go out once 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.210
 to the pool and my father was long ago 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.680
 below and then I have somehow 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.960
 so weird sounds heard so I know 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.380
 not whether we have enough if I knew 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.230
 which briefly shut the ears 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.700
 then I have that way accordingly 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.110
 noise heard and I thought okay at 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.220
 It's so bad but you think so 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.150
 yes, these are adult people 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.660
 Let's do that 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.150
 I'm on balcony and guess what 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.560
 something on the cheek so between room and 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.820
 balcony was such a fat 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.510
 Camera on the tripod 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.920
 that is, did I do not know 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.710
 if that was private or if I was that 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.050
 you know that 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.150
 that was my second story what you 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.880
 If you are on vacation , that's what I want 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:47.390
 is not what you do not let me off 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:49.460
 your side was yes there it comes too 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.660
 to my second story and indeed 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.700
 it's back to something like just now 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.890
 something similar was the formula 1 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.810
 race at tgz 's hockenheimring 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.010
 No one and then was still good there too 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.240
 vettel world champion but this year 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.730
 there was really shit like that 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.230
 Run that shit was second 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.470
 Disqualified because something was not 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.330
 idea 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.760
 and soon on the cheapest 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.080
 place on the lawn until it was clear 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.800
 the curve has also accelerated 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.760
 our fucking bad nice and how it 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 of course, there always has to be 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.870
 vollidioten and I stood there then 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.530
 So on the edge of the track so with me 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.960
 still secret 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.550
 It is also relatively in the forest and the 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.440
 States do not stop outside so 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.960
 the route but in the forest on the 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.740
 trees, so to speak 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.240
 and then they just have to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.510
 they just got stuck 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.470
 So to speak, so to speak 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.060
 And so not on the race track 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.250
 everything a bit too crass if 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.050
 So what a car does not get off then 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.180
 bad if I use it 300 km or so 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.530
 drives as top speed and then 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.860
 it has stood on the trees like that 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:48.740
 stuffed all possibilities 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.870
 bottles sticks stones so what do I know 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.050
 Badly ugly and yes that was mine too 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.400
 second story and yes if it is you 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.540
 let's say there writes 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.910
 your guess looks into the commission 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.350
 pass papaya and yes, come now 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.230
 to the resolution of the 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.120
 last consequence believe us the same way or 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.500
 it comes to the resolution of the last episode 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.480
 and yes, I have a short one 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.670
 stories were correct and that was true 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.470
 the first story was my first one 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.610
 Of course, history was a lie than one 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.810
 that's a bit extreme anyway 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.280
 obviously but still good 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.630
 some thought it would be the second 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.730
 history of noah was logical 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.800
 wrong and the second of me was so 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.880
 then it was already known that is 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.540
 Looks her guess in the 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.550
 Comments 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.580
 I would be happy and perverted dad 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.410
 his channel of course and yes it can 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.370
 a bit more open video though 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.540
 still too much for bock is for you 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.280
 to record and yes, as I said of course 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.280
 Last night you are there
