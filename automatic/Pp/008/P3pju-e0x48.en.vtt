00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the transmission control solenoid so

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.839 
the transmission control solenoid so
what<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> replace<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.699> its

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what you do is replace this with its

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.089 
what you do is replace this with its
proper<00:00:27.180> gasket<00:00:28.039> if<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> location

proper gasket if you see the location

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.590 
proper gasket if you see the location
cutting<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.610> ray<00:00:33.149> underneath<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
cutting down there ray underneath the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.979 
cutting down there ray underneath the
training<00:00:33.930> lines<00:00:34.730> its<00:00:35.730> identified<00:00:36.300> by<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> big

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
training lines its identified by the big

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
training lines its identified by the big
connector<00:00:37.940> right<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:40.460> three<00:00:41.460> bolts

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
connector right here and three bolts

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.950 
connector right here and three bolts
hold<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:43.250> off<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.460> brake<00:00:44.700> cleaner<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
hold it on off a brake cleaner and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
hold it on off a brake cleaner and
compress<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.629> sure<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.809> don't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
compress there so make sure you don't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.240 
compress there so make sure you don't
have<00:00:49.020> any<00:00:49.140> dirt<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.410> debris<00:00:49.500> fall<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
have any dirt and debris fall into the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.660 
have any dirt and debris fall into the
transmission<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.010> remove<00:00:53.219> our<00:00:53.340> negative

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
transmission so we remove our negative

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.889 
transmission so we remove our negative
battery<00:00:53.940> kit<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:57.120> next<00:00:57.300> step<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.750> use

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
battery kit here the next step is we use

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
battery kit here the next step is we use
the<00:00:57.989> eight<00:00:58.140> millimeter<00:00:58.559> socket<00:00:59.449> to<00:01:00.449> remove

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the eight millimeter socket to remove

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
the eight millimeter socket to remove
the<00:01:02.390> cable<00:01:03.390> connector<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> solenoid

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the cable connector to the solenoid

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.910 
the cable connector to the solenoid
okay<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.980> is<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:09.560> things<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
okay so here is where things get a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
okay so here is where things get a
little<00:01:11.040> bit<00:01:14.390> what<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.630> done<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:16.170> removed

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little bit what I have done is removed

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.790 
little bit what I have done is removed
one<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> transmission

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
one of the one of the transmission

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.060 
one of the one of the transmission
cooler<00:01:23.160> lines<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:25.820> sensor<00:01:28.070> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
cooler lines and then the sensor that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.260 
cooler lines and then the sensor that
goes<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.550> top<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:30.870> access<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.650> bolt<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
goes into the top to access that bolt a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.100 
goes into the top to access that bolt a
little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> training<00:01:33.600> flow<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.050> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
little bit of training flow is going to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
little bit of training flow is going to
come<00:01:34.230> out<00:01:34.380> no<00:01:35.010> big<00:01:35.190> deal<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.580> make<00:01:35.700> sure<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
come out no big deal to make sure the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.410 
come out no big deal to make sure the
area<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.300> clean<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:38.550> we<00:01:38.640> remove<00:01:38.970> those<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
area is clean so we remove those the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.130 
area is clean so we remove those the
rest<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> now<00:01:42.510> they<00:01:42.660> remove<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
rest the way out so now they remove the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.830 
rest the way out so now they remove the
bolt<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.619> bogey<00:01:44.100> long<00:01:44.630> compared<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bolt through bogey long compared to the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
bolt through bogey long compared to the
trouble<00:01:46.140> light<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:46.979> pretty

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
trouble light you can see them pretty

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.710 
trouble light you can see them pretty
long<00:01:50.540> remove<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> harness<00:01:52.290> connector<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
long remove the harness connector so it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.359 
long remove the harness connector so it
is<00:01:54.840> free<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.410> now<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.800> get<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> budget

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.050 
part in with its new gasket
I<00:02:21.220> guess<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.370> kind<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.610> cramped<00:02:22.880> into

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I guess if you kind of cramped into

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.250 
I guess if you kind of cramped into
place<00:02:23.350> once<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.740> back<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:26.260> alright

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
place once you put it back up in alright

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.860 
place once you put it back up in alright
here's<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.590> shot<00:02:27.800> from<00:02:27.890> underneath<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.400> car

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
here's a shot from underneath the car

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:39.910 
here's a shot from underneath the car
after<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.319> get<00:02:30.440> his<00:02:30.620> piece<00:02:32.140> up<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.440> there

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.570 

tripping<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> harness<00:02:41.660> slide<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.840> piece

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
tripping the harness slide this piece

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.320 
tripping the harness slide this piece
into<00:02:44.580> place<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.210> to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
into place just like that I'm going to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.589 
into place just like that I'm going to
take<00:02:51.450> our<00:02:51.600> large

small balls
put<00:02:56.819> them<00:02:56.940> into<00:02:57.090> place

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.369 

okay<00:03:07.959> make<00:03:08.260> sure<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:08.530> torque<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.670> bolts<00:03:10.379> 205

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
okay make sure you torque the bolts 205

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:20.130
