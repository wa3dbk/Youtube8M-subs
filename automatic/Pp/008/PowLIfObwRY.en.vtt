one of the main reasons that computers

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.470 
one of the main reasons that computers

wear out and slow down over time is that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.220 
wear out and slow down over time is that
the<00:00:21.810> old<00:00:22.020> hard<00:00:22.619> disk<00:00:22.890> drives<00:00:23.220> wear<00:00:23.759> out<00:00:24.230> this

the old hard disk drives wear out this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
the old hard disk drives wear out this
is<00:00:25.439> due<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.919> spinning<00:00:26.220> disk<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.910> is

is due to the spinning disk that is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
is due to the spinning disk that is
