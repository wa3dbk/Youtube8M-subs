00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you what it was like to use a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
you what it was like to use a
three-point<00:00:09.210> tracking<00:00:09.599> system<00:00:09.929> using<00:00:10.469> our

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
three-point tracking system using our

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.140 
three-point tracking system using our
wireless<00:00:10.889> prototype<00:00:11.190> controllers<00:00:11.700> where<00:00:12.030> we

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
wireless prototype controllers where we

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.959 
wireless prototype controllers where we
had<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.830> controller<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.980> each<00:00:14.070> hand<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.490> then

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
had a controller in each hand and then

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.250 
had a controller in each hand and then
we<00:00:15.089> had<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> third<00:00:15.540> controller<00:00:15.839> mounted<00:00:15.990> on

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
we had a third controller mounted on

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.960 
we had a third controller mounted on
your<00:00:16.379> head<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.490> positional<00:00:17.940> tracking

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
your head or the positional tracking

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.200 
your head or the positional tracking
when<00:00:18.390> using<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> awkward<00:00:18.930> strip<00:00:20.000> now<00:00:21.000> keep<00:00:21.119> in

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
when using the awkward strip now keep in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.550 
when using the awkward strip now keep in
mind<00:00:21.270> our<00:00:21.600> stem<00:00:21.810> system<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> support

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
mind our stem system is going to support

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
mind our stem system is going to support
up<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> five<00:00:22.980> tracking<00:00:23.460> points<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.660> today

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
up to five tracking points and so today

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.000 
up to five tracking points and so today
I'm<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> show<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
peek on an in game avatar then let's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.060 
peek on an in game avatar then let's
check<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.320> two<00:00:43.530> drivers<00:00:43.890> one

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
check it out so we have two drivers one

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.090 
check it out so we have two drivers one
of<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.250> hands<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> email

of these hands we have is for the email

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
of these hands we have is for the email
or<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.340> he's<00:00:47.460> into<00:00:47.670> yourself<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> we're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
or if he's into yourself now and we're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.960 
or if he's into yourself now and we're
using<00:00:49.469> ik<00:00:49.920> solver<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.949> figure<00:00:52.949> out

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
using ik solver to figure out

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.150 
using ik solver to figure out
arms<00:00:55.690> joint<00:00:56.080> positions<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:56.920> orientations

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
arms joint positions and orientations

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.890 
arms joint positions and orientations
and<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.480> works<00:00:58.660> pretty<00:00:59.200> awesome<00:01:00.750> I've<00:01:01.750> also

and it works pretty awesome I've also
had<00:01:02.110> two<00:01:02.380> other<00:01:02.500> trackers<00:01:02.830> I've<00:01:03.160> got<00:01:03.400> one<00:01:03.580> on

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
had two other trackers I've got one on

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
had two other trackers I've got one on
each<00:01:03.790> foot<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.430> book<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.030> I've<00:01:07.270> got<00:01:07.420> some

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
each foot on this book and I've got some

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.080 
each foot on this book and I've got some
pretty<00:01:08.650> good<00:01:08.860> articulation

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.770 

okay<00:01:13.840> um<00:01:15.539> if<00:01:16.539> I<00:01:17.039> enable<00:01:18.039> some<00:01:18.189> crouch<00:01:18.609> and<00:01:19.060> bum

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
okay um if I enable some crouch and bum

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.010 
okay um if I enable some crouch and bum
here<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.130> physically<00:01:21.789> bent<00:01:22.569> out<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.780> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
here now I physically bent out of the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.219 
here now I physically bent out of the
real<00:01:23.170> world<00:01:23.439> all<00:01:25.289> analog<00:01:26.289> crouch<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.539> then<00:01:29.110> if

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
real world all analog crouch and then if

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.529 
real world all analog crouch and then if
i<00:01:29.350> use<00:01:29.560> my<00:01:30.189> paper<00:01:30.399> some<00:01:30.610> different<00:01:31.119> positions

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
i use my paper some different positions

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.660 
i use my paper some different positions
in<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.530> attic<00:01:32.740> me<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.039> already<00:01:33.340> kind<00:01:33.640> of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
in the attic me it's already kind of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.630 
in the attic me it's already kind of
figures<00:01:33.939> out<00:01:34.060> what<00:01:34.209> to<00:01:34.329> do<00:01:37.049> pretty<00:01:38.049> cool<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
figures out what to do pretty cool so

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.510 
figures out what to do pretty cool so
now<00:01:40.569> I<00:01:40.600> want<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.140> walk<00:01:41.289> I'll<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.219> blend<00:01:42.429> right

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
now I want to walk I'll just blend right

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.080 
now I want to walk I'll just blend right
into<00:01:42.729> an<00:01:42.909> animation<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.399> what<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.670> need<00:01:45.909> by

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
into an animation and what I need by

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.260 
into an animation and what I need by
that<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.630> on<00:01:47.489> let's<00:01:48.489> say<00:01:48.579> you<00:01:48.640> have<00:01:48.849> one<00:01:49.060> foot

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
that is on let's say you have one foot

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.209 
that is on let's say you have one foot
up<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.569> then<00:01:50.349> you<00:01:50.470> started<00:01:50.739> to<00:01:50.829> walk<00:01:50.950> forward

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
up and then you started to walk forward

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.459 
up and then you started to walk forward
all<00:01:51.849> my<00:01:51.909> might<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:53.020> mission<00:01:53.439> right<00:01:53.530> there<00:01:55.469> you

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
all my might a mission right there you

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.529 
all my might a mission right there you
can<00:01:56.619> still<00:01:56.860> interact<00:01:57.759> with<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.060> objects<00:01:58.390> to

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
can still interact with the objects to

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.899 
can still interact with the objects to
second<00:01:58.840> scoop

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.320 

but<00:02:05.509> actually<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.950> imagine<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:08.979> actually<00:02:09.979> have

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
but actually I imagine you actually have

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
but actually I imagine you actually have
physics<00:02:11.330> NP

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.880 

run<00:02:15.920> faster<00:02:16.430> out<00:02:16.550> here

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.450 

oh<00:02:20.950> yeah<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.090> cool<00:02:23.130> sunflowers<00:02:24.130> that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
oh yeah that's a cool sunflowers that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.010 
oh yeah that's a cool sunflowers that
we've<00:02:24.670> turned<00:02:24.910> into<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> little<00:02:25.360> rag<00:02:25.600> dolls<00:02:25.810> and
