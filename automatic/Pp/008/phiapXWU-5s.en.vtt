00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
down here to move this is the equivalent

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.330 
down here to move this is the equivalent
of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> c-stick<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.700> game

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
you the right control stick is so it'll

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.590 
you the right control stick is so it'll
be<00:01:43.929> quick<00:01:44.619> smashes<00:01:45.039> every<00:01:45.609> direction<00:01:45.759> the
