CATALASE TEST
Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.380
all living organisms that are exposed to oxygen.
During aerobic respiration, microorganisms

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.300
produce hydrogen peroxide and, in some cases,
an extremely toxic superoxide. Accumulation

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.170
of these substances will result in death of
the organism unless they can be enzymatically

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:39.340
degraded. Organisms capable of producing catalase,
rapidly degrade hydrogen peroxide to oxygen

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.289
and water.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.879
The catalase test is used to determine the
ability of microorganisms to degrade hydrogen

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.069
peroxide by producing the enzyme catalase.
MATERIALS REQUIRED

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.539
Clean glass Slides
Overnight culture of organisms

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.949
Inoculation loop
Hydrogen Peroxide (3% H2O2 )

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.350
Water
Glass Capillary tube

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.570
Marking Pen
Bunsen burner

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.020
ALL MATERIALS ARE ARRANGED INSIDE LAF
PROCEDURE:

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.780
The hydrogen peroxide can be added directly
to a slant culture or to bacteria smeared

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.850
on a clean glass slide. Accordingly, there
are two types of methods

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.790
SLIDE METHOD and SLANT METHOD
1) SLIDE METHOD

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.400
Take glass slide and divide it into two sections
with a marker pen. One should be labeled as

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.070
T(for” test”) and the other as C (for“control”)
Place a small drop of water on each area

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.410
Now take the overnight culture.
Take inoculating loop

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.560
Flame it and allow to cool for some time
Now open the culture tube and flame the mouth

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.700
Using the inoculation loop, take small colony
of the organism from the test tube containing

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.520
overnight culture.
Again flame the mouth of the tube and close

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.530
the same.
Now transfer the colony into the marked fields

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.879
on the glass slide.
Emulsify the colonies on each drop to make

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.000
a smooth suspension. The smear should be about
the size of a pea.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.470
Now take hydrogen peroxide.
With a Pasteur pipette, place one or two drops

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.350
of hydrogen peroxide over the test smear.
Be careful not to run the drops together.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.660
Do not put anything on the other drop that
serves as control

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.210
Result: After addition of hydrogen peroxide
on the marked field, if the organism is catalase

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.530
positive, bubbles will form on the glass slide.
This is a positive result.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.890
For catalse negative organisms, there will
not be any bubble formation.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.400
2)SLANT METHOD
Take overnight culture

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.150
Take hydrogen peroxide.
Open the mouth of the tube containing the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.800
culture
Add 2-3 drops of hydrogen peroxide using the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.591
glass capillary tube
Result: After addition of hydrogen peroxide

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:09.370
on the slant culture, presence of bubble formation
is a positive result. Absence of bubble formation

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.480
is a negative result
