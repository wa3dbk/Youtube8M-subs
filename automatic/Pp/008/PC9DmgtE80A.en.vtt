driver<00:00:57.880> in<00:00:58.030> general<00:00:58.420> got<00:00:58.719> a<00:00:58.750> link<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.110> at

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
driver in general got a link to that at

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.200 
driver in general got a link to that at
the<00:00:59.440> site<00:00:59.590> as<00:00:59.710> well<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.940> gonna<00:01:01.030> have<00:01:01.120> to

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
aren't aware what USB debugging is if we

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.919 
aren't aware what USB debugging is if we

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
one should be USB debugging make sure

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.699 
one should be USB debugging make sure
that's<00:01:29.920> checked<00:01:31.289> once<00:01:32.289> you<00:01:32.380> have<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.560> plugged
