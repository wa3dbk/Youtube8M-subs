third<00:01:23.640> flame<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> rev<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.140> car<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
third flame when you rev up your car and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
third flame when you rev up your car and
the<00:01:25.740> flame<00:01:26.159> shoots<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> exhaust<00:01:26.970> pipes

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the flame shoots out the exhaust pipes

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.480 
the flame shoots out the exhaust pipes
it<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.960> almost<00:01:28.200> spawns<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> above<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it like almost spawns it above the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
which is something that's I guess a bug

a<00:03:04.569> drift<00:03:05.019> build<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.950> assuming<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.430> might

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
a drift build so I'm assuming that might

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.430 
a drift build so I'm assuming that might
be<00:03:06.940> why<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.330> got<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> wider<00:03:07.870> wheels<00:03:08.200> and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
be why it's got the wider wheels and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.140 
be why it's got the wider wheels and
stuff<00:03:08.620> for<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.950> deep-dish<00:03:09.400> wheels<00:03:09.670> but<00:03:09.910> it

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
stuff for the deep-dish wheels but it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
stuff for the deep-dish wheels but it
makes<00:03:10.450> this<00:03:10.540> car<00:03:10.750> look<00:03:10.900> super<00:03:11.200> sexy<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.830> it's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
good bumps that I went over so I wasn't

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.960 
good bumps that I went over so I wasn't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
able to do that except for the beginning

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.670 
able to do that except for the beginning
gameplay<00:04:30.480> where<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.750> guys<00:04:30.900> saw<00:04:31.170> where<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> was

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
actually driving on two wheels because I

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.940 
actually driving on two wheels because I
took<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.840> corner<00:04:34.110> too<00:04:34.350> sharp<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.740> that's

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
took a corner too sharp and that's

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.040 
took a corner too sharp and that's
something<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:36.000> kind<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.360> wish<00:04:36.570> was<00:04:36.810> in

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
something that I kind of wish was in

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.600

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
vehicles that are a little lower to the

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.750 
vehicles that are a little lower to the
ground<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.830> suspension<00:04:41.340> would<00:04:41.490> work

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
ground that the suspension would work

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.370 
ground that the suspension would work
properly<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.570> yeah<00:04:42.810> that's<00:04:42.930> about<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.350> only

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
properly but yeah that's about the only

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.440 
properly but yeah that's about the only
thing<00:04:43.740> that's<00:04:44.070> pretty<00:04:44.250> cool<00:04:44.370> about<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.910> o<00:04:45.120> or

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
thing that's pretty cool about this o or

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.690 
thing that's pretty cool about this o or
the<00:04:45.480> other<00:04:45.840> fact<00:04:46.170> that<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.620> been<00:04:46.890> pretty

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
the other fact that it's been pretty

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.270 
the other fact that it's been pretty
much<00:04:47.910> like<00:04:48.210> transferred<00:04:48.990> over<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.680> converted

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
much like transferred over and converted

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.580 
much like transferred over and converted
from<00:04:50.730> driver<00:04:51.240> San<00:04:51.630> Francisco<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.200> think<00:04:52.440> that's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
from driver San Francisco I think that's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.720 
from driver San Francisco I think that's
what<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.830> game<00:04:52.980> was<00:04:53.190> called<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.670> was

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
what the game was called and it was

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.030 
what the game was called and it was
transferred<00:04:54.240> for<00:04:54.450> Grand<00:04:54.660> Theft<00:04:54.780> Auto<00:04:54.900> 5<00:04:55.260> using

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
a mod or in mob tool so that's another

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.600 
a mod or in mob tool so that's another
cool<00:04:58.440> fact<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.830> guess<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.100> guys<00:04:59.190> can<00:04:59.250> see<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
cool fact I guess you guys can see the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.040 
cool fact I guess you guys can see the
gameplay<00:04:59.820> there<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.390> went<00:05:00.630> on<00:05:00.690> two<00:05:00.870> wheels

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
gameplay there that I went on two wheels

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.420 
gameplay there that I went on two wheels
but<00:05:01.200> yeah<00:05:01.560> guys<00:05:01.740> that's<00:05:01.860> pretty<00:05:01.980> much<00:05:02.280> the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
but yeah guys that's pretty much the

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.340 
but yeah guys that's pretty much the
only<00:05:02.490> thing<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.330> interior<00:05:03.990> for<00:05:04.200> this

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
only thing and the interior for this

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.290 
only thing and the interior for this
vehicle<00:05:04.530> isn't<00:05:04.980> really<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.460> great<00:05:06.030> it's

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
vehicle isn't really that great it's

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.910 
vehicle isn't really that great it's
kind<00:05:06.510> of<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:06.690> pixelated<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.470> stuff<00:05:07.710> so

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
kind of like pixelated and stuff so

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.900 
kind of like pixelated and stuff so
that's<00:05:08.070> why<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.220> didn't<00:05:08.400> show<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.610> guys<00:05:08.730> the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.520 
that's why I didn't show you guys the
interior<00:05:09.540> but<00:05:09.750> let's<00:05:10.020> go<00:05:10.080> ahead<00:05:10.110> and<00:05:10.290> get<00:05:10.380> into

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
interior but let's go ahead and get into

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.740 
interior but let's go ahead and get into
the<00:05:10.770> fourth<00:05:11.100> vehicle<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.060> fourth<00:05:12.480> vehicle

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
this one had just been released and I

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.770 
this one had just been released and I
think<00:05:44.700> it's<00:05:44.820> only<00:05:44.940> been<00:05:45.120> out<00:05:45.210> for<00:05:45.450> like<00:05:45.480> maybe

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
think it's only been out for like maybe

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.300 
think it's only been out for like maybe
an<00:05:45.960> hour<00:05:46.140> at<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.500> time<00:05:46.680> of<00:05:46.830> recording<00:05:46.950> the

an hour at the time of recording the
commentary<00:05:47.790> for<00:05:47.970> this<00:05:48.120> vehicle<00:05:48.360> although<00:05:48.990> it

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
commentary for this vehicle although it

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.080 
commentary for this vehicle although it
does<00:05:49.410> look<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:49.800> lot<00:05:50.100> better<00:05:50.310> when<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.790> wheels

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
does look a lot better when the wheels

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.940 
does look a lot better when the wheels
are<00:05:51.360> black<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:51.870> in<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.320> is<00:05:52.500> just<00:05:52.710> my<00:05:52.830> opinion

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
are black and in this is just my opinion

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.980 
are black and in this is just my opinion
when<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.520> thing<00:05:53.700> is<00:05:53.730> completely<00:05:54.419> blacked<00:05:54.810> out

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
when the thing is completely blacked out

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.690 
when the thing is completely blacked out
and<00:05:55.260> then<00:05:55.410> I<00:05:55.590> think<00:05:55.800> it<00:05:55.950> looks<00:05:56.130> a<00:05:56.220> lot<00:05:56.460> better

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
and then I think it looks a lot better

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.250 
and then I think it looks a lot better
without<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.300> window<00:05:57.570> tint<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:58.080> the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
without the window tint but the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.020 
without the window tint but the
headlights<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:58.860> do<00:05:58.919> wish<00:05:59.190> would<00:05:59.430> stay<00:05:59.700> black

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
headlights I do wish would stay black

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.430 
headlights I do wish would stay black
because<00:06:00.390> that<00:06:00.510> looks<00:06:00.690> just<00:06:00.810> really<00:06:01.140> sick<00:06:01.320> when

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
because that looks just really sick when

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.750 
because that looks just really sick when
they<00:06:01.560> were<00:06:01.650> black<00:06:01.890> but<00:06:02.190> yeah<00:06:02.370> guys<00:06:02.520> that's

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.859 
downforce and when you slow down it'll
go<00:07:00.649> back<00:07:00.860> down<00:07:01.099> into<00:07:01.369> its<00:07:01.520> original<00:07:02.149> position

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:02.869 
go back down into its original position

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:04.239 
go back down into its original position
now<00:07:02.929> something<00:07:03.319> that's<00:07:03.349> also<00:07:03.830> really<00:07:04.099> cool

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:04.249 
now something that's also really cool

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.709 
now something that's also really cool
about<00:07:04.459> this<00:07:04.669> is<00:07:04.879> when<00:07:04.999> you're<00:07:05.149> driving<00:07:05.629> the

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719 
about this is when you're driving the

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.659 
about this is when you're driving the
vehicle<00:07:06.050> you<00:07:06.229> have<00:07:06.259> the<00:07:06.469> option<00:07:07.129> to<00:07:07.279> keep<00:07:07.459> the

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
vehicle you have the option to keep the

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.189 
vehicle you have the option to keep the
wing<00:07:07.849> up<00:07:08.029> so<00:07:08.330> that<00:07:08.449> it's<00:07:08.599> fully<00:07:08.809> functional

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 
wing up so that it's fully functional

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.079 
wing up so that it's fully functional
and<00:07:09.679> when<00:07:09.800> I<00:07:09.830> say<00:07:10.039> fully<00:07:10.279> functional<00:07:10.819> the

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089 
and when I say fully functional the

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.969 
and when I say fully functional the
faster<00:07:11.449> you<00:07:11.569> go<00:07:11.749> the<00:07:12.169> higher<00:07:12.379> the<00:07:12.589> wing<00:07:12.769> goes

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
faster you go the higher the wing goes

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.850 
faster you go the higher the wing goes
up<00:07:13.189> and<00:07:13.429> the<00:07:13.610> slower<00:07:13.939> you<00:07:14.179> go<00:07:14.240> the<00:07:14.839> farther<00:07:15.649> the

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
up and the slower you go the farther the

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.379 
up and the slower you go the farther the
wing<00:07:16.039> will<00:07:16.189> actually<00:07:16.490> go<00:07:16.669> down<00:07:16.699> you<00:07:17.059> guys<00:07:17.179> can

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
wing will actually go down you guys can

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.879 
wing will actually go down you guys can
actually<00:07:17.509> go<00:07:17.779> ahead<00:07:17.809> and<00:07:18.019> turn<00:07:18.229> that<00:07:18.259> function

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
actually go ahead and turn that function

off and keep the wing completely down as

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.209 
off and keep the wing completely down as
