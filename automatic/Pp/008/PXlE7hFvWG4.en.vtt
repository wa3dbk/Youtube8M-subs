bees and the reason I bought this one is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.930 
bees and the reason I bought this one is
because<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.310> bees<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> the

because all my bees in with you the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.130 
because all my bees in with you the
bottom<00:00:18.210> board<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> don't<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.750> any<00:00:18.900> top

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
bottom board I don't have any top

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.120 
bottom board I don't have any top
entrances<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.779> this<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:21.960> when<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.949> want<00:00:23.100> to

going in underneath on the regular
entrance<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.439> bottom<00:00:31.679> board<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.949> then

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
entrance on your bottom board and then

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.100 
entrance on your bottom board and then
inside<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.520> come<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.850> below<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> plate

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
inside they come up below this plate

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
inside they come up below this plate
here<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> crawl<00:00:34.950> through<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.250> series

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
here and have to crawl through a series

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
here and have to crawl through a series
of<00:00:35.550> screens<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> they'll<00:00:36.870> come<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.200> back

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of screens and they'll come out back

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.610 
of screens and they'll come out back
here<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.620> follow

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
here actually and this would be follow

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.020 
here actually and this would be follow
your<00:00:40.890> frame<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> bottom<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
your frame so this is the bottom of the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850 
your frame so this is the bottom of the
height<00:00:42.180> you've<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.350> draw<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.770> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
height you've got a little draw here on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
height you've got a little draw here on
the<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.070> slides<00:00:44.550> open<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> close<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the back slides open and close this is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
the back slides open and close this is
where<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.500> harvest<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.010> your

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
where you actually harvest out your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
where you actually harvest out your
pollen<00:00:47.460> granules<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> again<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pollen granules and again it's on the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
pollen granules and again it's on the
back<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> hive<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.039> interrupt

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
back of the hive so you don't interrupt

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
back of the hive so you don't interrupt
you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.390> interrupt<00:00:51.719> traffic<00:00:52.079> when<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> go

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you don't interrupt traffic when you go

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.160 
you don't interrupt traffic when you go
to<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.680> pollen<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.539> I'll<00:00:54.539> new<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.899> I

to get your pollen so I'll new to this I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.510 
to get your pollen so I'll new to this I
don't<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.129> any<00:00:56.280> more<00:00:56.430> than

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
get her set up on a hive here and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
get her set up on a hive here and
hopefully<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.170> harvesting<00:01:01.680> some<00:01:02.039> poem<00:01:02.340> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
hopefully start harvesting some poem so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.050 
hopefully start harvesting some poem so
here<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> hive<00:01:04.790> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> put<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
here it is on the hive going to put it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520 
here it is on the hive going to put it
on<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> time<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
on this time because this is this is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130 
on this time because this is this is
actually<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.950> big<00:01:08.220> colony<00:01:08.810> even<00:01:09.810> they've<00:01:09.990> kept

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
actually a big colony even they've kept

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
actually a big colony even they've kept
brood<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.740> boxes<00:01:11.840> but<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.260> of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
brood in all boxes but it's not one of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
brood in all boxes but it's not one of
my<00:01:14.180> dedicated<00:01:15.180> honey<00:01:15.330> hives

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
my dedicated honey hives

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.120 
my dedicated honey hives
so<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> didn't<00:01:16.409> want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.860> honey

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so I didn't want to put this on honey

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
so I didn't want to put this on honey

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
potential slowdown pain flow some people
say<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> queen<00:01:21.960> excluders<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.560> slow<00:01:22.710> down

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

obviously<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
obviously for this you kind of have to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.230 
obviously for this you kind of have to
create<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> blockage<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.909> call<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
create a blockage to get that call and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
create a blockage to get that call and
so<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> bees<00:01:34.439> are<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.710> buzzing

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so see the bees are really buzzing

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.140 
so see the bees are really buzzing
around<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.310> front<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:35.880> trying<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
around the front now they're trying to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.130 
around the front now they're trying to
kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> figure<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.689> off

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
kind of figure it off

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
kind of figure it off
you<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> entrance<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you know the entrance to them is the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.950 
you know the entrance to them is the
same<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.420> call<00:01:39.630> inside

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
same but then once they call inside

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.940 
same but then once they call inside
they're<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.350> confused

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
they're going to be confused

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
they're going to be confused
they've<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> figure<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.479> looks

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
they've got to figure that out but looks

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
they've got to figure that out but looks
like<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.439> give<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.040> little

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
like we actually give it a little little

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.060 
like we actually give it a little little
bit<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> problem<00:01:45.119> coming<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
