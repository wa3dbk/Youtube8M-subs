00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
 a monument 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.080
 in the same cemetery where the remains of beethoven rest 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.350
 of brahms schubert and the havoc a sharp face seems to lean out of the future 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.279
 monsoon 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.549
 from the grave of a young Austrian who died at the age of 36 in the middle of a 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.439
 mystery 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:17.429
 your soccer 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.650
 let's have him those who saw him play 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 not for nothing they told him the mozart in football 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.829
 integrated crews and on February 10, 1903 the cost for arias then 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.530
 It was part of the still Austro-Hungarian Empire 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.050
 in this sense lived in the English capital program play a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.140
 it is said that he was unwittingly the best forward center in the world in his time 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.640
 the trip and his feet 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190
 when traveling 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 he seemed to float as if he were a statesman 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 physically he had a strange genetic combination 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 that we could imagine if we add the thinness and piqueteros 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.040
 the movements decide 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.130
 and the posture of alfredo di stÃ©fano 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.330
 Sneaky cossu and only smile when the ball crashed against the nets 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 of the goal 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.990
 with austria vienna won five national cups a league title and two 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 cups and trophies 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 with the selection 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.380
 it was a coup de grace 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.990
 in those years the Austrians displayed a vanguard football 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.990
 and they were known as the pointer 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 it was in that wonderful team where cindy composed his masterpieces that such 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.170
 they took him first to death and then to immortality 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 that squad lost only four matches of 50 matches played 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.270
 among these the semifinal of the 1934 world cup and the Olympic final of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 Berlin 1936 both against Italy 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.060
 that's why when germany was annexed to austria in 1938 and wanted to dispose of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.429
 territory of its people and its culture 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.479
 the symbolic paper man what the subjugated people never dared to do 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.509
 before the invasion Hitler gave the order to form the German team with the 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.509
 best Austrian footballers to give in the World Cup in France 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.469
 but without the art he resisted in his own way 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.749
 on April 3 of that same month 138 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.939
 played a game to celebrate the election 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:32.989
 that would be 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.699
 the last of his life 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.819
 the second half defeated the Germans 2 to 0 one of the goals was 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.079
 paper name who celebrated dancing in front of the box of honor 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.049
 the generalists 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.789
 he was sentenced by the nun 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.459
 but he had the opportunity to amend the offense if he agreed to play for Germany 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.869
 in the world Cup 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:51.919
 he did not want 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.329
 from that moment to sympathize an outlaw 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.109
 and although people do not look at the prov and their soccer became a way of 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.009
 resistance he had to hide 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:07.499
 he never played again, he could never live free the gestapo crazy or day 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 and night 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.709
 January 22, 1939 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.689
 the firemen came to a call from him 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.049
 it smelled like gas 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.650
 the young couple from one of the departments did not respond to the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.629
 called 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.969
 they were matias and his wife camila 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.549
 asleep forever 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.479
 In his bedroom 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.269
 the death of cinderal has two versions which speaks of suicide 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.929
 another that indicates the ministry 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:41.619
 is that his funeral attended 40 thousand people and the truth is that with him 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.619
 a part of austria had died 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:55.719
 bhatia sindelar is remembered as the mozart football say that in Vienna the 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.899
 geniuses die prematurely 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.899
 and is buried in the central cemetery of the city 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.349
 next to music monsters that live in peace with the paper man
