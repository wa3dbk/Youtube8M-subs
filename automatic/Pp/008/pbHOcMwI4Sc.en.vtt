hence you have lower back pain because
your<00:01:10.790> quadricep<00:01:11.420> muscles<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:12.050> too<00:01:12.380> tight<00:01:12.410> so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
your quadricep muscles are too tight so

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.450 
your quadricep muscles are too tight so
not<00:01:14.570> only<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:14.960> but<00:01:15.110> they<00:01:15.230> also<00:01:15.410> refer<00:01:16.100> pain

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
not only that but they also refer pain

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.710 
not only that but they also refer pain
from<00:01:16.940> their<00:01:17.060> trigger<00:01:17.420> point<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:19.180> your<00:01:20.180> hip<00:01:20.420> all

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
knee pain from a trigger point that's in

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.710 
knee pain from a trigger point that's in
the<00:01:36.620> top<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.100> your<00:01:37.160> quadricep<00:01:37.790> muscle<00:01:38.180> up<00:01:38.360> here

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
the top of your quadricep muscle up here

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.900

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
knee and then when that muscle is very

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.000 
knee and then when that muscle is very
tight<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.390> can<00:01:44.630> pull<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.170> your<00:01:45.380> pelvis<00:01:45.590> and
