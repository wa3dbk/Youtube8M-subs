insight these headphones retail for 3
$99.99<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:51.120> expensive

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
$99.99 so they are very very expensive

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.080 
$99.99 so they are very very expensive
um<00:00:51.930> typically<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.920> probably<00:00:53.340> wouldn't<00:00:53.820> spend

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
um typically I probably wouldn't spend

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.189 
um typically I probably wouldn't spend
that<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> money<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.840> these<00:00:54.989> headphones

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that kind of money on these headphones

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.750 
that kind of money on these headphones
but<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.890> I've<00:00:56.129> had<00:00:56.809> studios<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> past

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
but because I've had studios in the past

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
but because I've had studios in the past
that's<00:00:59.760> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> what<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.510> basing<00:01:00.870> off<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that's kind of what I'm basing off of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's kind of what I'm basing off of
that's<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.859> basing<00:01:02.690> that's<00:01:03.690> why<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that's what I was basing that's why I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.329 
that's what I was basing that's why I
would<00:01:04.260> recommend<00:01:04.290> these<00:01:04.860> headphones<00:01:05.070> that

would recommend these headphones that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
would recommend these headphones that
can't<00:01:05.640> spit<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.560> they<00:01:07.560> these

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

die and you happen to have had you know
you<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.610> wire<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.209> or<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.420> wire

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
you have the wire on you or the wire

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.300 
you have the wire on you or the wire
connection<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.230> can<00:03:06.350> just<00:03:06.530> plug<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
wired and then you know the cord is long

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.470 
wired and then you know the cord is long
enough<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.050> whatever<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.830> like

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
enough for whatever so it's not like

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.720 
enough for whatever so it's not like
it's<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.630> like<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.930> it<00:03:12.560> would<00:03:12.590> be<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:13.220> problem

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
it's not like you it would be a problem

I was using them the whole time and you

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.970 
I was using them the whole time and you
know<00:03:44.750> some<00:03:44.930> of<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.110> time<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.320> did<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:45.950> of

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
know some of the time I did and some of

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.289 
know some of the time I did and some of
the<00:03:46.100> time<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.280> did<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.910> watched<00:03:47.090> like<00:03:47.269> a

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
the time I did and we watched like a

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.790 
the time I did and we watched like a
movie<00:03:47.570> for<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.750> couple<00:03:48.019> hours<00:03:48.140> and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
movie for a couple hours and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.790 
movie for a couple hours and
worked<00:03:49.040> out<00:03:49.160> really<00:03:49.340> good<00:03:49.960> as<00:03:50.960> far<00:03:51.440> as<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
worked out really good as far as the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.100 
worked out really good as far as the
overall<00:03:52.240> noise-canceling<00:03:53.240> because<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.810> cups

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
overall noise-canceling because the cups

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.860 
overall noise-canceling because the cups
go<00:03:54.530> over<00:03:54.920> your<00:03:55.130> ears<00:03:55.520> they<00:03:55.790> kind<00:03:56.030> of<00:03:56.150> block<00:03:56.690> out

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
go over your ears they kind of block out

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.360 
go over your ears they kind of block out
all<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.200> sound<00:03:57.440> like<00:03:57.650> right<00:03:57.770> away<00:03:57.920> as<00:03:58.070> soon<00:03:58.160> as

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
all the sound like right away as soon as

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.370 
all the sound like right away as soon as
I<00:03:58.430> put<00:03:58.610> them<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:58.880> without<00:03:59.780> even<00:03:59.930> having<00:04:00.170> any

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
I put them on without even having any

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.800 
I put them on without even having any
music<00:04:00.800> playing<00:04:01.040> or<00:04:01.220> just<00:04:01.250> turning<00:04:01.670> them<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:01.910> it

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
music playing or just turning them on it

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.120 
music playing or just turning them on it
blots<00:04:03.110> out<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.320> lot<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.680> sound<00:04:03.920> which

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
blots out a lot of the sound which

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.980 
blots out a lot of the sound which
definitely<00:04:04.700> helps<00:04:05.120> significantly<00:04:05.750> when

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
definitely helps significantly when

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
you're when you watch it or when you

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.910 
you're when you watch it or when you
watch<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.660> movie<00:04:08.690> or<00:04:09.230> listen<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.470> music<00:04:09.530> or

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
watch a movie or listen to music or

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.500 
watch a movie or listen to music or
whatever<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.340> you're<00:04:10.490> doing<00:04:10.640> that

whatever it is you're doing that

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.820 
whatever it is you're doing that
definitely<00:04:11.900> helps<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:14.380> really<00:04:15.380> really<00:04:15.620> like

wouldn't recommend is because of how

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.240 
wouldn't recommend is because of how
high<00:04:26.390> in<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.870> headset<00:04:27.230> is<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.590> how<00:04:27.680> are<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250

headphones are and how expensive they

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.280 
headphones are and how expensive they
are<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:30.380> was<00:04:31.070> using<00:04:31.280> them<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.640> gym<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.290> to

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530
