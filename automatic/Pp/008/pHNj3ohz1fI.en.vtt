 it goes to the actual video 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.430
 I start with a lipstick from 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.380
 Essens from the long-lasting lips x series 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030
 I have that in my last dm hall 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.520
 you'll find that again 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 linked here and below in the infobox 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 In any case, if you know me know 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 her that i have this lipstick series 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 actually super super good 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 and I'll try a nude 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 I thought I had the lipsticks 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 I like it well then I'll take it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 this lipstick but unfortunately I am 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.740
 a bit disappointed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.240
 I know when nude tones it is or at 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
 it is anyway very bright lipsticks 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.710
 difficult but with me wearing this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.630
 Lipstick scary lips 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.310
 It does not really happen to me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
 have at the same time for example, corel 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 bought the calling is great as all 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 others that I've tested so far 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 maybe I have a monday product 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.799
 caught with this me but yes that is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 not so nice for me because I do 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.880
 Continue with a home care product and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.770
 Although from valea, that's how it looks 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.290
 It is the cream peeling with aloe 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 Vera for every skin type and here is 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.670
 on it intense pilling effect that can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.439
 I only confirm that I find that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.799
 product really really well used 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.100
 like and yes who is looking for 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.270
 a peeling is 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
 I can only recommend that I have it 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.260
 I also bought because I know I have 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.540
 you still remember that you can 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.400
 from 1 october darlings video with mobile phone 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.330
 and she has been banned from that and 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 I was just looking for 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.020
 peeling then it has turned out so and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 I could only agree with me is 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.150
 It is also very good and I can only 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.040
 recommend if you ever at 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.480
 facial care products are showing i 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.120
 the second product of this kind 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.580
 because that's about baby murder's world way 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 Slices of cleaning well and I have 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.120
 it was not shown in the dmv because i was in the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.060
 fink box had but you get that 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.680
 Definitely with dm and I think very well 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 that's why I wanted you I show the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.920
 I always have that under the shower 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.190
 and just use it around my face 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.810
 once thoroughly clean and find 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.910
 that very very pleasant I have from it 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.070
 no skin blemishes or so 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.160
 I always tolerated it well, I think 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.920
 It smells good and I just like it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.180
 very much like it is pleasantly gentle too 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280
 if he stands slices of cleaning 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.900
 you do not have to have somehow now 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.090
 Look like washing your hair or something 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.830
 is just good pleasant 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.760
 consistency I do not know exactly what 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.010
 to say about it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.730
 it's just a good one 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.640
 cleaning products for my face 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.490
 opinion then I have two more 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.380
 more lipsticks from this p2 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.420
 the glam lipstick series 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.360
 These are the two good pieces once 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.300
 The color 048 lively trust and the color 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.340
 071 mona lisas may i wear that 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.890
 By the way, also straight and I think 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 really really very very good very 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.500
 pleasant to apply those are like that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.240
 name already says a bit here though 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.610
 I find that saying in everyday life 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.960
 and even if the colors are 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.400
 do you differ it is yes 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.780
 Sometimes so we do not like the colors 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.700
 Strongly pigmented , they are in the end 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.990
 all look the same but that is included 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.870
 Not the case I have now 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.370
 now four or five colors 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.710
 this series and can do it all 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.660
 recommend 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.310
 There are two more products from G2 the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.160
 very excited me chose was 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.340
 these are the two years of blood touch 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.140
 compactflash and that way and that way 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.960
 they look and they look like that 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.250
 that's the color 0 30 touch on boni 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.590
 and the color only ten touch of very 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.820
 and yes I think the industry is 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 really really good i think that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.780
 color selection of which are also great 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.660
 definitely not the only ones who stay 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.940
 I own or own it 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.410
 because I just think it's really good 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.690
 I think they are super pigmented 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.370
 not too strong but not too 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.960
 weak so they are alright 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.790
 pigmented you may have to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.920
 Take care a little bit that it 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.930
 also the only drawback what I at the 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.790
 sometimes they are one 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.310
 very little bit bitchy in the order 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.990
 but I think if you look at it 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.419
 you can get used to it very well 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.860
 work and I find the result 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.540
 beautiful I find the colors 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.760
 beautiful and that's why I like her 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.169
 very much like 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.820
 Then we come to a shampoo of 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.220
 he bally us what that moisture 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.680
 good with mango and aloe vera had that 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.470
 I'm mainly with the fragrance 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.750
 I still buy that one 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.900
 Divine, that almost shows drinking 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.520
 really looks like mango extract says 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.580
 It's so scary in any case 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.010
 strong after mango and i like the air 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.020
 really really like it but unfortunately 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.669
 not at all in effect 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.470
 convinced there is a moisture comes 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.840
 and my hair is like after that 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.130
 straw i looked like a little baby 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.080
 lion like that and that's definitely not that 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.650
 what should do that has only 65 cents 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.580
 tasted 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.229
 there it is again so thing what 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.840
 you can really expect it from me 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.669
 unfortunately not convinced 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.810
 I would not advise you but that 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.479
 does not mean that each at the 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.580
 Shampoo so is the last product 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.880
 a nail polish from p2 and that is the 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.470
 color 0 16 title dream and the color 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.450
 still finds wonderfull 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.669
 is really nice on the nails too 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.500
 from only the order was hell 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.600
 it was really terrible that way 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.310
 bitchy in the order and I think if that 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.080
 nail daily in the order of one has 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.490
 no more desire to 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.020
 paint and torture yourself with it 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.599
 it's a pity because the 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.289
 color really nice but well what 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.610
 you should do it 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.620
 I'll probably be back 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.180
 then across and when spring comes 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.740
 or the summer in any case if it is 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.750
 But I can get warmer before that 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.580
 I do not think it motivates me anymore 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.970
 thereby setting out again 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.830
 But what the hell are all the products 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.180
 which I tested more recently 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.050
 and to which I have your opinion 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.270
 wanted to say 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.860
 I'm curious to listen to what you're like 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.389
 so if you do not say the products 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.919
 have you ever tested me write that 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.870
 but please in the comments 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.270
 because they work with everyone else I am 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.830

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.389
