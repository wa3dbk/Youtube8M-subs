00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
at the top of there and then we draw

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
at the top of there and then we draw
like<00:00:43.120> another<00:00:43.480> oval<00:00:43.960> with<00:00:44.770> quite<00:00:45.039> pinched

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
what we do is we just flatten out that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.490 
what we do is we just flatten out that
top<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.440> but<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.370> onion<00:01:15.080> straws<00:01:16.080> slightly

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.520 

then<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.210> wait<00:03:24.300> for<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> ink<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.720> dry

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.450 

then<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.710> go<00:03:28.830> back<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.190> rub<00:03:29.310> out<00:03:29.430> the

then we just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:03:29.820> lines

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.760 

so<00:03:46.690> there<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:46.990> it<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.380> cute<00:03:47.560> little
