to confidence during that point and he
made<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:08.490> bad<00:01:08.880> bad<00:01:09.810> errors<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
made some I think bad bad errors so I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.460 
made some I think bad bad errors so I
broke<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.970> after<00:01:12.570> being<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> love

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
broke that after being down for the love
and<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> very<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.310> important<00:01:15.000> game<00:01:15.659> for

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.140 
and I was a very very important game for
me<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.759> broke<00:01:17.759> him<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
me because then I broke him in the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.210 
me because then I broke him in the
beginning<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> third<00:01:18.960> set<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> started

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
beginning of the third set so I started

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.770 
beginning of the third set so I started
to<00:01:20.340> feel<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> bit<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:20.759> confident<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to feel a bit more confident and then I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
to feel a bit more confident and then I
played<00:01:21.960> another<00:01:22.259> good<00:01:22.500> game<00:01:22.680> too<00:01:22.920> sore<00:01:23.159> for

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
played another good game too sore for

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.670 
played another good game too sore for
three<00:01:23.580> love<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> really

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
three love and that you know that really

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
helped my game and I think that might be
the<00:01:27.630> key<00:01:28.110> Kia<00:01:28.500> game<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> match<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.939> seemed

Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors I think I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
that I think the funnel last year was

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.220 
that I think the funnel last year was
more<00:02:55.799> excited<00:02:56.340> because<00:02:56.459> that's<00:02:57.230> unbelievable

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
great points and I think that's why the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.430
