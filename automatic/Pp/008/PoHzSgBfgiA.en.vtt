weight way science is they have three

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.260 
weight way science is they have three

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
stages of way for optimal results

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.090 
stages of way for optimal results
because<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:06.360> don't<00:03:06.510> use<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.590> casings

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
because they don't use the the casings

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.320 
because they don't use the the casings

to take whey protein well every scoop of
the<00:05:26.970> optimum<00:05:27.300> contains<00:05:27.630> 24<00:05:28.080> grams<00:05:28.290> of<00:05:28.470> protein

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
the optimum contains 24 grams of protein
