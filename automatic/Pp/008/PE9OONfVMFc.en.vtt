00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so the first gonna be using it to strike

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
so the first gonna be using it to strike
up<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> short-range<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
up for the short-range we're going to be

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
up for the short-range we're going to be
just<00:01:46.799> doing<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> pitch<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.759> downturn<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
just doing the pitch on a downturn I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.960 
just doing the pitch on a downturn I
think<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.659> striker<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.970> there's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
think but so this is striker so there's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.370 
think but so this is striker so there's
a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> people<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.600> techniques<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
a lot of people that have techniques and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.539 
a lot of people that have techniques and
I<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.479> shoot<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.070> cut<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> bullets<00:01:59.430> with

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I I shoot like a cut the bullets with

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910 
I I shoot like a cut the bullets with
the<00:01:59.579> GA<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> GaN<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> called

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the GA with the GaN I think is called

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
the GA with the GaN I think is called
and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.670> I'd<00:02:02.790> spin<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.270> jump<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.380> know

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and then I'd spin and jump or you know

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.020 
and then I'd spin and jump or you know
you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> loads

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you can do it you know like this loads

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210 
you can do it you know like this loads
of<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.240> its<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.600> by<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.409> right<00:02:07.680> days<00:02:07.890> laying

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
of but its but by the right days laying

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580 
of but its but by the right days laying
down<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.670> striker<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.959> he's<00:02:10.140> close

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
down and striker so you know he's close

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.710 
down and striker so you know he's close
distance<00:02:11.039> right<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
distance right so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780 
distance right so
as<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.380> saw<00:02:13.530> there<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.740> nearly<00:02:14.010> died<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.580> that's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
as you saw there I nearly died so that's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.120 
as you saw there I nearly died so that's
how<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.030> need<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.600> certain<00:02:16.170> job<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.560> work<00:02:16.740> so

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
how you need a certain job to work so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.150 
how you need a certain job to work so
you<00:02:17.160> need<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.580> diet<00:02:17.790> literally<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> right<00:02:19.980> here

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
you need to diet literally so right here

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.620 
you need to diet literally so right here
again<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> striker<00:02:20.820> again<00:02:21.180> because<00:02:21.360> it's<00:02:21.480> not

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
again the striker again because it's not

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.990 
again the striker again because it's not
very<00:02:21.810> high<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.530> still<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.400> right

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
very high up so that's still like right

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
very high up so that's still like right
you<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.360> short-range<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.530> won't

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
you know short-range but now you won't

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.090 
you know short-range but now you won't
get<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> space<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> space<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:31.110> medium

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
get the space now the space is medium

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.800 
get the space now the space is medium
range<00:02:32.340> which<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.820> quite<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.540> like

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
range which is quite you know like

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.540 
range which is quite you know like
medium<00:02:34.200> range<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.710> striker<00:02:35.190> wouldn't<00:02:35.430> give

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
medium range the striker wouldn't give

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.150 
medium range the striker wouldn't give
you<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> full<00:02:36.660> damage<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.890> spares

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you like a full damage that the spares

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680 
you like a full damage that the spares
with<00:02:38.310> those<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.210> here<00:02:39.450> he's<00:02:39.570> just

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
with those so as you see here he's just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
with those so as you see here he's just
going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.960> shoot<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.800> felt<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.220> time<00:02:41.400> I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
going to shoot me you felt that time I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.610 
going to shoot me you felt that time I
didn't<00:02:41.700> even<00:02:41.850> shoot<00:02:41.970> me<00:02:42.090> properly<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.500> as

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
didn't even shoot me properly but so as

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.890 
didn't even shoot me properly but so as
you'll<00:02:43.740> see<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.100> nearly<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.700> death

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
you'll see here I nearly get to death

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.470 
you'll see here I nearly get to death
right<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.640> no<00:02:47.640> that's<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> get<00:02:48.330> me

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
right there so no that's going to get me

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.120 
right there so no that's going to get me
higher<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> could<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:49.950> next

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
higher so I could get on to this next

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.980 
higher so I could get on to this next
part<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.540> guys<00:02:57.720> right

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
part right here and like that guys right

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.840 
part right here and like that guys right
so<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.200> next<00:02:58.260> one's<00:02:58.590> gonna<00:02:58.740> be<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.980> model<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so the next one's gonna be the model the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.670 
so the next one's gonna be the model the
model<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.300> exactly<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.720> same<00:03:00.840> thing<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.410> just

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
model is exactly the same thing but just

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220 
model is exactly the same thing but just
like<00:03:02.190> higher<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.790> reason<00:03:03.240> being<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.990> reason

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
like higher up reason being the reason

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.350 
like higher up reason being the reason
why<00:03:04.350> it's<00:03:04.470> medium<00:03:05.310> close<00:03:05.940> distance

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
why it's medium close distance

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.980 
why it's medium close distance
medium-range<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.230> long-range<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:08.250> because

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
medium-range and long-range is because

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.750 
medium-range and long-range is because
each<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.050> these<00:03:10.410> guns<00:03:10.710> have<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.040> bigger<00:03:11.490> power

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
each of these guns have a bigger power

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.790 
each of these guns have a bigger power
while<00:03:12.000> strike<00:03:12.300> light<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.810> one<00:03:13.410> angle<00:03:13.590> of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
while strike light is that one angle of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.320 
while strike light is that one angle of
so<00:03:13.950> much<00:03:14.070> power<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.700> when<00:03:14.880> you're<00:03:15.030> right<00:03:15.210> next

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
so much power so when you're right next

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.830 
so much power so when you're right next
to<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.780> kill<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.340> spaz<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.700> medium<00:03:18.420> so

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
to me that kill you spaz is medium so

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050 
to me that kill you spaz is medium so
don't<00:03:19.290> kill<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.220> model<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.760> higher

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
don't kill you and the model is higher

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.449 
don't kill you and the model is higher
so<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.630> kill<00:03:21.810> well<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.110> it's

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
so we don't kill well like that it's

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.010 
so we don't kill well like that it's
India's<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:23.730> light<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.810> that
