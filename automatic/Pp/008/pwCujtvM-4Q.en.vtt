00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:06.729 
when I first saw the effect of me coming

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.700 
when I first saw the effect of me coming
out<00:00:06.819> of<00:00:06.939> the<00:00:07.029> urinal<00:00:07.509> I<00:00:07.689> was<00:00:07.810> screaming<00:00:08.109> with

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
out of the urinal I was screaming with

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:16.170 
out of the urinal I was screaming with
excitement<00:00:14.310> she<00:00:15.310> was<00:00:15.430> house<00:00:15.580> for<00:00:15.760> season<00:00:16.029> two

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180

excitement she was house for season two
has<00:00:16.299> been<00:00:16.359> enormous<00:00:17.109> we<00:00:17.679> have<00:00:17.800> very<00:00:18.039> very

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
has been enormous we have very very

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.800 
has been enormous we have very very
limited<00:00:18.490> amounts<00:00:19.119> of<00:00:19.210> time<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.419> turn<00:00:19.689> around

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
limited amounts of time to turn around

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.439 
limited amounts of time to turn around
these<00:00:20.849> effects<00:00:21.849> I<00:00:23.999> would<00:00:24.999> say<00:00:25.089> the<00:00:25.179> biggest

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
these effects I would say the biggest

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.540 
these effects I would say the biggest
challenges<00:00:25.810> were<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.349> make<00:00:26.949> the<00:00:27.189> Terminator

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
challenges were to make the Terminator

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:39.180 
challenges were to make the Terminator
future<00:00:27.989> familiar

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.850 

my<00:00:40.190> job<00:00:40.460> primarily<00:00:40.880> is<00:00:41.320> specifically<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
my job primarily is specifically to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.010 
my job primarily is specifically to
explore<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.400> possibilities<00:00:44.090> of<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.420> visual

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
explore the possibilities of the visual

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.070 
explore the possibilities of the visual
storytelling<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.790> show<00:00:47.000> whatever<00:00:47.750> visual

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
storytelling of the show whatever visual

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080 
storytelling of the show whatever visual
effects<00:00:48.410> appear<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.340> think<00:00:49.880> those<00:00:50.060> are

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
effects appear I think those are

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.610 
effects appear I think those are
incidental<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:51.020> you're<00:00:51.140> doing<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.560> I

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
incidental to what you're doing and I

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.830 
incidental to what you're doing and I
think<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:52.250> very<00:00:52.640> rarely<00:00:52.940> written

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
think that we very rarely written

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.990 
think that we very rarely written
something<00:00:54.380> that<00:00:54.770> is<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:55.100> doing<00:00:55.490> an<00:00:55.670> effect

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
something that is just doing an effect

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.120 
something that is just doing an effect
for<00:00:56.180> an<00:00:56.270> effect<00:00:56.540> sake<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.410> begins<00:00:57.830> with<00:00:57.980> an

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
for an effect sake it begins with an

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.970 
for an effect sake it begins with an
idea<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.120> idea<00:00:59.150> is<00:00:59.780> is<00:01:00.260> character<00:01:00.800> driven

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
idea and the idea is is character driven

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
idea and the idea is is character driven
Josh<00:01:01.580> writes<00:01:02.000> character<00:01:02.900> arcs<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.440> what's

Josh writes character arcs and what's
really<00:01:03.830> cool<00:01:03.950> about<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.550> that<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.820> means

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
really cool about that is that it means

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.240 
really cool about that is that it means
something<00:01:05.360> at<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.870> end<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.110> day<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.130> know

little thumbnail sketches of what you
know<00:01:33.470> what<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.800> this<00:01:33.950> what<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.369> story<00:01:34.580> that

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
know what is this what is the story that

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.730 
know what is this what is the story that
has<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.030> happen<00:01:35.210> here<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.690> then<00:01:35.750> in<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
has to happen here and then in the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.830 
has to happen here and then in the
process<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.460> doing<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:38.240> also<00:01:38.390> becomes<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
process of doing that it also becomes a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.870 
process of doing that it also becomes a
blueprint<00:01:39.259> of<00:01:39.470> execution<00:01:40.190> these<00:01:40.670> are<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
blueprint of execution these are the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.250 
blueprint of execution these are the
things<00:01:41.090> we're<00:01:41.240> going<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.540> need<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.750> do<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.170> be

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
things we're going to need to do to be

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.990 
things we're going to need to do to be
able<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.410> capture<00:01:42.620> that<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.580> like<00:01:43.700> having

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
able to capture that it's like having

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.690 
able to capture that it's like having
lead<00:01:44.150> our<00:01:44.330> da<00:01:44.540> Vinci<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.170> some<00:01:45.470> level<00:01:46.040> in<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
lead our da Vinci on some level in the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.570 
lead our da Vinci on some level in the
room<00:01:46.850> all<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.180> time

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
room all the time

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.130 
room all the time
very<00:01:49.580> art<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.150> design<00:01:50.270> driven<00:01:50.690> this<00:01:50.960> is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
very art and design driven this is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.320 
very art and design driven this is
something<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:52.040> I've<00:01:52.159> always<00:01:52.400> done<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.120> it's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
something that I've always done and it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.660 
something that I've always done and it's
my<00:01:53.510> approach<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.230> you<00:01:54.770> know<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.250> look<00:01:55.580> at

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
my approach is that you know I look at

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.690 
my approach is that you know I look at
it<00:01:55.850> as<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.900> graphic<00:01:57.409> novel<00:01:57.440> or<00:01:58.010> animation

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
it as is a graphic novel or animation

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.580 
it as is a graphic novel or animation
and<00:01:58.880> one<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.480> those<00:01:59.630> things<00:01:59.930> start<00:02:00.230> off<00:02:00.320> with

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
and one of those things start off with

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.410 
and one of those things start off with
those<00:02:00.800> two<00:02:01.070> particular<00:02:01.700> pieces<00:02:02.330> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
those two particular pieces of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.730 
those two particular pieces of
entertainment<00:02:02.960> start<00:02:03.110> off<00:02:03.170> with<00:02:03.320> drawings

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
entertainment start off with drawings

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.560 
entertainment start off with drawings
will<00:02:04.220> sort<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.490> production<00:02:04.880> meeting<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.270> he

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
will sort of production meeting and he

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.160 
will sort of production meeting and he

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.020 
performance and suddenly none of us
would<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.530> thought<00:03:47.620> about<00:03:47.889> let's<00:03:48.849> go<00:03:48.970> in

need<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.780> design<00:03:56.199> an<00:03:56.530> HK<00:03:57.099> prototype<00:03:57.639> that<00:03:58.180> is

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
need to design an HK prototype that is

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.390 
need to design an HK prototype that is
also<00:03:58.959> reminiscent<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.829> California

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
things that that are so rooted in

you're<00:04:57.770> not<00:04:57.860> pushing<00:04:58.130> it<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> place<00:04:58.760> where

things<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.340> are<00:05:04.430> designed<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.390> fit

within<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.960> narrative<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.160> has<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.400> be

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
within the narrative and so it has to be

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.550 
within the narrative and so it has to be
engineered<00:05:07.640> but<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.419> also<00:05:08.570> has<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.840> tell<00:05:08.990> story

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
engineered but it also has to tell story

engineered but it also has to tell story
it<00:05:09.740> has<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.980> tell<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.160> story<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.520> either

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
it has to tell a story that's either

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.190 
it has to tell a story that's either
about<00:05:10.940> its<00:05:11.090> character<00:05:11.510> or<00:05:11.870> about<00:05:12.080> its

was an incredible leap forward there was

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.950 
was an incredible leap forward there was
a<00:05:30.020> shift<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:31.160> technology<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:32.090> possibility<00:05:32.840> in

a shift in technology and possibility in

a shift in technology and possibility in

something that wasn't good
it<00:05:36.200> became<00:05:36.410> ubiquitous<00:05:36.740> suddenly<00:05:37.460> everything

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
precedent from Terminator 2 and I really

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.490 
precedent from Terminator 2 and I really
laugh<00:05:49.790> at<00:05:50.000> our<00:05:50.120> initial<00:05:50.450> conversations<00:05:51.230> about

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
laugh at our initial conversations about

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.250 
laugh at our initial conversations about
it<00:05:51.650> now<00:05:51.800> because<00:05:52.450> we<00:05:53.450> talked<00:05:53.690> about<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:54.140> and

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
it now because we talked about it and

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.500 
it now because we talked about it and
Jim<00:05:54.500> said<00:05:54.770> I<00:05:55.010> think<00:05:55.730> we'll<00:05:56.060> be<00:05:56.150> able<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.360> do<00:05:56.420> it

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
Jim said I think we'll be able to do it

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.030 
Jim said I think we'll be able to do it
faster<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.140> I<00:05:57.440> think<00:05:57.590> we'll<00:05:57.680> be<00:05:57.770> able<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.950> do

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
faster and I think we'll be able to do

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.380 
faster and I think we'll be able to do
it<00:05:58.130> better<00:05:58.220> and<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.760> think<00:05:58.970> we'll<00:05:59.060> be<00:05:59.180> able<00:05:59.270> to

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
it better and I think we'll be able to

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.860 
it better and I think we'll be able to
you<00:05:59.990> know<00:06:00.080> do<00:06:00.350> it<00:06:00.470> cheaper<00:06:00.890> after<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.870> urinal

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
you know do it cheaper after the urinal

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.100 
you know do it cheaper after the urinal
morph<00:06:03.110> which<00:06:03.440> took<00:06:03.790> 90<00:06:04.790> different<00:06:05.210> passes<00:06:05.840> I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
morph which took 90 different passes I

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.780 
morph which took 90 different passes I
said<00:06:06.770> Jim<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:07.040> said<00:06:07.070> I<00:06:07.310> thought<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.580> said<00:06:07.730> that

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
said Jim I said I thought you said that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.400 
said Jim I said I thought you said that
all<00:06:08.060> this<00:06:08.180> morphing<00:06:08.540> thing<00:06:08.690> was<00:06:08.840> easy<00:06:09.170> now

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
all this morphing thing was easy now

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.200 
all this morphing thing was easy now
he's<00:06:09.620> like<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:09.920> was<00:06:10.070> wrong<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:10.580> was<00:06:10.640> really

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
he's like I was wrong it was really

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.960 
he's like I was wrong it was really
tough<00:06:11.480> to<00:06:11.510> sort<00:06:11.990> of<00:06:12.170> get<00:06:12.470> it<00:06:12.670> to<00:06:13.670> the<00:06:13.790> point

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
tough to sort of get it to the point

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.730 
tough to sort of get it to the point
where<00:06:14.090> it<00:06:14.270> kind<00:06:14.480> of<00:06:14.540> looked<00:06:14.780> right<00:06:15.080> just

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
where it kind of looked right just

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.900 
where it kind of looked right just
because<00:06:15.860> you<00:06:16.010> have<00:06:16.130> a<00:06:16.190> program<00:06:16.400> that<00:06:16.550> more<00:06:16.820> if

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
because you have a program that more if

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.010 
because you have a program that more if
something<00:06:17.270> doesn't<00:06:17.420> mean<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.780> ends<00:06:17.960> up

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
something doesn't mean it ends up

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.420 
something doesn't mean it ends up
looking<00:06:18.230> like<00:06:18.440> you<00:06:18.830> want<00:06:19.070> it<00:06:19.130> to<00:06:19.280> look

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
looking like you want it to look

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.010 
looking like you want it to look
especially<00:06:20.030> if<00:06:20.330> you're<00:06:20.480> morphing<00:06:20.810> things

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
especially if you're morphing things

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.020 
especially if you're morphing things
like<00:06:21.230> a<00:06:21.260> toilet<00:06:21.740> into<00:06:21.980> you<00:06:22.580> know<00:06:22.670> shirley

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
like a toilet into you know shirley

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.870 
like a toilet into you know shirley
manson<00:06:23.180> just<00:06:23.900> so<00:06:24.020> cool<00:06:24.290> and<00:06:24.560> seemed<00:06:25.130> very<00:06:25.280> sort

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
manson just so cool and seemed very sort

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.390 
manson just so cool and seemed very sort
of<00:06:25.970> in<00:06:26.300> tune<00:06:26.630> with<00:06:26.900> particularly<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.130> first

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
of in tune with particularly the first

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.130 
of in tune with particularly the first
two<00:06:28.580> Terminator<00:06:29.060> movies<00:06:29.390> that<00:06:29.540> I<00:06:29.600> was<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.840> huge

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
two Terminator movies that I was a huge

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.290 
two Terminator movies that I was a huge
fan<00:06:30.410> of<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.950> I<00:06:31.160> was<00:06:31.640> oh<00:06:31.700> my<00:06:31.850> god<00:06:32.000> that<00:06:32.180> could

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
fan of and I was oh my god that could

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.450 
fan of and I was oh my god that could
have<00:06:32.420> come<00:06:32.570> straight<00:06:32.600> out<00:06:33.110> of<00:06:33.140> like<00:06:33.620> t<00:06:33.980> 1<00:06:34.190> or<00:06:34.310> 2

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
have come straight out of like t 1 or 2

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.600 
have come straight out of like t 1 or 2
so<00:06:34.880> I<00:06:35.180> was<00:06:36.110> really<00:06:36.380> chuffed<00:06:36.620> at<00:06:36.950> I<00:06:37.160> think<00:06:37.520> he's

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
so I was really chuffed at I think he's

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.540 
so I was really chuffed at I think he's
done<00:06:37.760> an<00:06:37.850> amazing<00:06:38.030> job<00:06:38.380> to<00:06:39.380> be<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.740> t1000<00:06:40.490> we

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
done an amazing job to be the t1000 we

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.330 
done an amazing job to be the t1000 we
had<00:06:40.700> to<00:06:40.850> we<00:06:41.240> had<00:06:41.270> to<00:06:41.390> do<00:06:41.660> a<00:06:41.690> 3d<00:06:42.170> rendering<00:06:42.890> of

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
had to we had to do a 3d rendering of

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.700 
had to we had to do a 3d rendering of
her<00:06:43.520> in<00:06:43.730> various<00:06:44.030> different<00:06:44.240> costumes<00:06:44.870> then

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
her in various different costumes then

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.010 
her in various different costumes then
you<00:06:46.640> know<00:06:46.730> this<00:06:46.910> goes<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.210> performance<00:06:47.780> in

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
you know this goes to performance in

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.010 
you know this goes to performance in
turn<00:06:48.170> and<00:06:48.350> acting<00:06:48.890> she<00:06:49.430> needs<00:06:49.640> to<00:06:49.940> act<00:06:50.270> like<00:06:50.750> a

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
turn and acting she needs to act like a

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.570 
turn and acting she needs to act like a
liquid<00:06:51.350> metal<00:06:51.590> Terminator<00:06:52.100> and<00:06:52.280> get<00:06:52.430> that

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
liquid metal Terminator and get that

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.700 
liquid metal Terminator and get that
movement<00:06:53.000> right<00:06:53.120> I<00:06:53.420> became<00:06:54.140> such<00:06:54.410> a<00:06:54.440> great

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
movement right I became such a great

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.490 
movement right I became such a great
actress<00:06:55.070> that<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:55.610> actually<00:06:56.420> became<00:06:56.750> a<00:06:56.960> urinal

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
actress that I actually became a urinal

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.610 
actress that I actually became a urinal
it<00:06:57.620> was<00:06:57.770> really<00:06:58.220> impressive

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.689 

I'm<00:07:03.310> sorry<00:07:03.610> I<00:07:03.729> pissed<00:07:04.090> you<00:07:04.300> off<00:07:04.330> mr.<00:07:04.990> tuck<00:07:05.290> I
