ah<00:00:00.030> i<00:00:00.539> have<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.500> stop<00:00:01.829> him

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:15.130 

it's<00:00:08.029> right<00:00:08.240> up<00:00:08.300> ahead

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.570 

we<00:00:15.620> have<00:00:15.770> to<00:00:15.890> find<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.250> point<00:00:16.490> of

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
we have to find the point of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.310 
we have to find the point of
vulnerability<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:17.690> fulcrum<00:00:18.110> of<00:00:18.200> the

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
vulnerability the fulcrum of the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.350 
vulnerability the fulcrum of the
foreskin<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.460> only<00:00:19.850> way<00:00:20.060> to<00:00:20.120> get

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
foreskin it's the only way to get

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.390 
foreskin it's the only way to get
through<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.630> now<00:00:21.320> it<00:00:21.500> should<00:00:21.710> be<00:00:21.890> right<00:00:22.190> below

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
through it now it should be right below

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.260 
through it now it should be right below
the<00:00:22.730> place<00:00:22.940> that<00:00:23.150> has<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.450> highest<00:00:23.840> voltage

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.480 

that<00:00:30.270> was<00:00:30.480> close<00:00:30.780> if<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.620> a<00:00:31.710> fulcrum<00:00:32.189> maybe

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
that was close if it's a fulcrum maybe

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.360 
that was close if it's a fulcrum maybe
it's<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> center<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.330> low<00:00:33.600> down<00:00:34.370> all

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
it's in the center and low down all

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.040 
it's in the center and low down all
right<00:00:35.780> lowing<00:00:36.780> center<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:37.950> okay
