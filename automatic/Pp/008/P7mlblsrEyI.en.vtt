to<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.110> cap<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.210> get<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.630> all<00:02:26.780> out

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.200

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
this could use them all

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.050 
this could use them all
because<00:02:44.960> this<00:02:45.140> unit<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.760> extremely<00:02:46.760> thick

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
because this unit is extremely thick

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.030 
because this unit is extremely thick
even<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.870> back<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.380> can't<00:02:48.620> even<00:02:48.710> wear<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.950> in

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.680 
even to the back I can't even wear it in
high<00:02:49.220> ponytail<00:02:49.790> because<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.210> is<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.480> thick

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
high ponytail because it is so thick

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.560 
high ponytail because it is so thick
that's<00:02:50.900> why<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.290> been<00:02:52.030> hidden<00:02:53.030> all<00:02:53.360> this
