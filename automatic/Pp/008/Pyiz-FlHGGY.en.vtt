American connector so I need to find an
adapter<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.400> that's<00:02:33.640> done<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.030> Box

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
adapter for that that's done in the Box

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.780 
adapter for that that's done in the Box
also<00:02:36.010> inside<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> box<00:02:36.670> there<00:02:37.239> are<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:38.790> two

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
also inside the box there are one two

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.160 
also inside the box there are one two
three<00:02:39.819> four<00:02:40.269> five<00:02:41.230> six<00:02:41.590> screws<00:02:42.329> there's<00:02:43.329> two

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
three four five six screws there's two

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.240 
three four five six screws there's two
with<00:02:44.530> collars<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.579> for<00:02:46.739> normal<00:02:47.739> last

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
with collars and just for normal last

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.160 
with collars and just for normal last
codes<00:02:48.609> now<00:02:48.790> before<00:02:49.180> these<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.600> mounting<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.079> I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
codes now before these are mounting it I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.319 
codes now before these are mounting it I
guess<00:02:50.410> or<00:02:50.680> fermenting<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.970> looks<00:02:55.239> like

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
guess or fermenting this it looks like

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.789 
guess or fermenting this it looks like
what<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:55.989> meant<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.470> use<00:02:56.620> these

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
what you meant to do is use these

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.789 
what you meant to do is use these
colored<00:02:57.250> ones<00:02:58.950> take<00:02:59.950> them<00:03:00.100> out<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> box<00:03:01.799> so

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
colored ones take them out of the box so

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.080 
colored ones take them out of the box so
you've<00:03:02.980> got<00:03:03.100> these<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.310> ones<00:03:03.760> with<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you've got these little ones with the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.110 
you've got these little ones with the
colors<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.720> them<00:03:05.430> hopefully<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.910> see

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
colors on them hopefully you can see

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.629 
colors on them hopefully you can see
that<00:03:07.150> reasonably<00:03:07.750> well<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> very<00:03:09.130> big<00:03:09.400> head

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
that reasonably well so a very big head

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.610 
that reasonably well so a very big head
and<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:10.030> collar<00:03:10.389> on<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.989> think<00:03:11.049> those<00:03:11.440> are

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and a collar on it so I think those are

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.960 
and a collar on it so I think those are
meant<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.829> go<00:03:12.010> into<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> back<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.760> chrome

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
meant to go into the back of the chrome

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.140 
meant to go into the back of the chrome
box<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:13.540> they'll<00:03:13.690> slot<00:03:14.109> into<00:03:14.470> these

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
box and then they'll slot into these

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
box and then they'll slot into these
gates<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.389> then<00:03:16.569> that<00:03:16.690> amount<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.170> there

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
gates and then that amount in there

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.559 
gates and then that amount in there
obviously<00:03:18.400> pick<00:03:18.579> two<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.060> than<00:03:19.299> two<00:03:19.480> in

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
obviously pick two in here than two in

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.670 
obviously pick two in here than two in
the<00:03:19.600> bottom<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.019> then<00:03:20.139> that<00:03:20.260> will<00:03:20.380> give<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
the bottom and then that will give you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.610 
the bottom and then that will give you
the<00:03:20.829> little<00:03:21.190> bracket<00:03:21.639> for<00:03:22.590> hanging<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the little bracket for hanging the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.599 
the little bracket for hanging the
chrome<00:03:23.980> box<00:03:24.700> itself<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.620> six<00:03:26.920> screws<00:03:27.160> for

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
chrome box itself so the six screws for

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.420 
chrome box itself so the six screws for
normal<00:03:28.000> plus<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.569> hangers<00:03:29.190> looks<00:03:30.190> decent

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
normal plus to the hangers looks decent

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.940 
normal plus to the hangers looks decent
enough<00:03:30.760> seems<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.480> would<00:03:31.569> be<00:03:31.920> quite<00:03:32.920> a

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
enough seems like it would be quite a

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.470 
enough seems like it would be quite a
functional<00:03:33.519> little<00:03:33.760> thing

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
functional little thing

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.020 
functional little thing
so<00:03:35.750> dirt<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.230> asus<00:03:36.650> chromebox<00:03:37.190> itself

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
consumption this one was manufactured in

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.800 
consumption this one was manufactured in
February<00:03:49.360> 2014

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
February 2014

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.309 
February 2014
so<00:03:51.470> we've<00:03:51.620> got<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.800> couple<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.160> blue<00:03:52.400> USB<00:03:52.940> USB<00:03:53.840> 3

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
so we've got a couple of blue USB USB 3

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.500 
so we've got a couple of blue USB USB 3
connectors<00:03:54.860> there<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.069> belief<00:03:55.340> couple<00:03:56.330> on<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
connectors there a belief couple on the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.089 
connectors there a belief couple on the
other<00:03:56.690> side<00:03:56.900> as<00:03:57.050> well<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.470> let's<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:57.980> do<00:03:58.069> that

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
other side as well so let's just do that

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.339 
other side as well so let's just do that
a<00:03:58.250> bit<00:03:58.400> slower<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:58.970> they<00:03:59.599> are<00:03:59.870> looking<00:03:59.989> at<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
a bit slower so they are looking at the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.729 
a bit slower so they are looking at the
top<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.830> right<00:04:00.980> way<00:04:01.190> up<00:04:02.140> still<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.230> itself<00:04:03.530> in

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
top the right way up still in itself in

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.949 
top the right way up still in itself in
as<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.980> can<00:04:04.130> see<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.970> front<00:04:05.360> edge<00:04:05.599> of<00:04:05.629> the

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
as you can see so the front edge of the

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.380 
as you can see so the front edge of the
two<00:04:06.170> USB<00:04:06.620> connectors<00:04:07.099> the<00:04:07.790> right<00:04:07.970> edge<00:04:08.209> is

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
two USB connectors the right edge is

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.380 
two USB connectors the right edge is
empty<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.950> back<00:04:10.160> we've<00:04:10.489> got<00:04:10.519> power

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
empty the back we've got power

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.240 
empty the back we've got power
Ethernet<00:04:13.150> we've<00:04:14.150> got<00:04:14.269> two<00:04:14.450> USBs<00:04:14.989> with<00:04:15.200> HDMI<00:04:15.920> on

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
Ethernet we've got two USBs with HDMI on

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.759 
Ethernet we've got two USBs with HDMI on
display<00:04:16.790> ports<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.389> then<00:04:17.600> what<00:04:18.440> looks<00:04:18.620> like<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
display ports and then what looks like a

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.159 
display ports and then what looks like a
microphone<00:04:19.010> connector<00:04:19.790> so<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.660> take<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.049> the

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
microphone connector so I take that the

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.540 
microphone connector so I take that the
audio<00:04:21.500> is<00:04:21.530> basically<00:04:21.979> audio<00:04:22.310> from<00:04:22.639> HDMI<00:04:23.350> and

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
audio is basically audio from HDMI and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.540 
audio is basically audio from HDMI and
around<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:26.620> left<00:04:27.620> hand<00:04:27.919> side<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> machine

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
around the left hand side of the machine

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.659 
around the left hand side of the machine
we've<00:04:29.419> got<00:04:29.810> our<00:04:30.139> Kensington<00:04:30.470> walk<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.400> we<00:04:31.520> got

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
we've got our Kensington walk and we got

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.560 
we've got our Kensington walk and we got
an<00:04:31.760> MMC

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
an MMC

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.480 
an MMC
SD<00:04:33.290> so<00:04:34.190> there's<00:04:34.310> an<00:04:34.400> MMC<00:04:34.760> SD<00:04:35.389> adapter<00:04:35.650> so<00:04:36.650> I'll

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
SD so there's an MMC SD adapter so I'll

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:45.279 
SD so there's an MMC SD adapter so I'll
just<00:04:37.669> take<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.970> certain<00:04:38.300> self<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:38.810> though<00:04:44.289> so

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
just take the certain self in though so

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.260 
just take the certain self in though so
just<00:04:45.470> release<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.979> single<00:04:46.550> tap<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.060> see<00:04:47.180> if

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
just release that single tap and see if

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.920 
just release that single tap and see if
we<00:04:47.389> can<00:04:47.539> sleep<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.050> night<00:04:48.700> there<00:04:49.700> we<00:04:49.789> go<00:04:49.970> ok

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
we can sleep this night there we go ok

here's another quick look let me just
I'm<00:04:54.860> gonna<00:04:55.039> zoom<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.550> bit<00:04:55.639> on<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:56.030> one<00:04:56.090> I

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
I'm gonna zoom in a bit on this one I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.719 
I'm gonna zoom in a bit on this one I
tried<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.780> focus<00:04:56.990> on<00:04:57.320> manually<00:04:57.800> let's<00:04:58.550> just

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
tried to focus on manually let's just

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.690 
tried to focus on manually let's just
manually<00:04:59.210> focus<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.690> state<00:04:59.930> as<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.229> can

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
manually focus of state as we can

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.960 
manually focus of state as we can
somewhere<00:05:01.700> about<00:05:01.910> there<00:05:02.090> should<00:05:02.150> work<00:05:03.970> yeah

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
somewhere about there should work yeah

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.000 
somewhere about there should work yeah

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
somewhere about that area so you can see

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.740 
somewhere about that area so you can see
the<00:05:07.310> connectors<00:05:07.729> like<00:05:07.789> just<00:05:08.120> do<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> punch<00:05:08.570> in

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
the connectors like just do a punch in

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.360 
the connectors like just do a punch in
video<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:09.289> I<00:05:09.320> can<00:05:09.530> actually<00:05:09.650> see<00:05:10.010> what's<00:05:10.190> in

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
video so I can actually see what's in

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.159 
video so I can actually see what's in
focus<00:05:11.560> easier<00:05:12.560> said<00:05:12.830> than<00:05:12.950> done

effectively the left hand edge the top
of<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.380> machine<00:05:40.650> looks<00:05:40.889> like<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.479> just

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
of the machine looks like this and just

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.620 
of the machine looks like this and just
trying<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.020> get<00:05:43.110> that<00:05:43.199> in<00:05:43.320> focus<00:05:43.650> again<00:05:44.630> easier

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
trying to get that in focus again easier

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.250 
trying to get that in focus again easier
said<00:05:45.870> than<00:05:46.020> done

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
said than done

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.550 
said than done
no<00:05:46.440> LTS<00:05:46.860> just<00:05:47.010> branding<00:05:47.639> there<00:05:47.820> and<00:05:48.560> the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
no LTS just branding there and the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.810 
no LTS just branding there and the
bottom<00:05:49.830> of<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:49.949> machine<00:05:50.250> has<00:05:50.370> got<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.550> suit<00:05:50.729> on

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
bottom of the machine has got a suit on

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.240 
bottom of the machine has got a suit on
bottom<00:05:51.150> things<00:05:51.360> on<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:52.220> basic<00:05:53.220> things

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
bottom things on it and basic things

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.930 
bottom things on it and basic things
like<00:05:53.610> that

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
like that

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.439 
like that
right<00:05:54.660> so<00:05:54.990> let's<00:05:55.740> just<00:05:55.830> try<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.250> focus<00:05:57.000> back

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
right so let's just try to focus back

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.490 
right so let's just try to focus back
where<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:58.020> want<00:05:58.199> to<00:05:58.380> be<00:05:58.500> back<00:05:58.710> down<00:05:59.010> there

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
where you want to be back down there

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.659 
where you want to be back down there
some<00:06:01.500> good<00:06:01.650> about<00:06:01.830> there<00:06:02.100> should<00:06:02.340> be<00:06:02.460> close

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
some good about there should be close

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.029 
some good about there should be close
enough<00:06:02.699> for<00:06:02.970> us<00:06:03.229> right<00:06:04.229> so<00:06:04.260> that's<00:06:04.560> basically

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
enough for us right so that's basically

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.010 
enough for us right so that's basically
everything<00:06:05.250> so<00:06:05.699> we've<00:06:05.880> got<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.810> box

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
everything so we've got the the box

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.180 
everything so we've got the the box
itself<00:06:07.500> we've<00:06:08.340> got<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.580> stand<00:06:08.940> so<00:06:09.919> as<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:11.070> can

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
itself we've got the stand so as you can

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.350 
itself we've got the stand so as you can
see<00:06:11.250> on<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.490> bottom<00:06:11.639> of<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.880> Machine<00:06:12.120> there's

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
see on the bottom of the Machine there's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.240 
see on the bottom of the Machine there's
four<00:06:12.630> rubber<00:06:12.900> feet<00:06:13.229> here<00:06:13.470> so<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:13.740> guess<00:06:14.010> those

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
four rubber feet here so I guess those

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.010 
four rubber feet here so I guess those
come<00:06:14.610> off<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:15.780> allow<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.080> access<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.949> the<00:06:18.020> the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
come off to allow you access to the the

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.779 
come off to allow you access to the the
visa<00:06:19.410> mounting<00:06:19.919> or<00:06:20.039> something<00:06:20.370> it<00:06:20.610> looks

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
visa mounting or something it looks

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.450 
visa mounting or something it looks
awful<00:06:21.599> like<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.169> just<00:06:22.590> meant<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:23.160> feet<00:06:23.370> are

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
awful like I just meant the feet are

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.890 
awful like I just meant the feet are
meant<00:06:23.639> to<00:06:23.669> come<00:06:23.880> off<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:25.669> I<00:06:26.669> guess<00:06:27.360> that<00:06:27.630> then

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
meant to come off and I guess that then

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.659 
meant to come off and I guess that then
stands<00:06:28.970> like<00:06:29.970> so<00:06:30.389> I<00:06:31.099> honestly<00:06:32.099> don't<00:06:32.490> know

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
stands like so I honestly don't know

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.279 
stands like so I honestly don't know
very<00:06:32.820> much<00:06:33.060> about<00:06:33.120> this<00:06:33.479> old<00:06:33.660> demonstrated

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
very much about this old demonstrated

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.870 
very much about this old demonstrated
test<00:06:34.530> it<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:34.740> little<00:06:34.919> bit<00:06:35.070> later<00:06:35.250> but<00:06:35.820> anyway

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
test it a little bit later but anyway

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.940 
test it a little bit later but anyway
that'll<00:06:36.360> do<00:06:36.479> for<00:06:36.690> basic<00:06:37.110> unboxing<00:06:37.680> sort

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
that'll do for basic unboxing sort

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.230 
that'll do for basic unboxing sort
