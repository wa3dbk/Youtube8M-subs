00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
a look at air gumdrops the update the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849 
a look at air gumdrops the update the
new<00:00:14.460> update<00:00:15.230> which<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.500> very<00:00:16.529> cool

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
because we have these say pattern

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.779 
because we have these say pattern
selectors<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:19.160> ABCD<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.650> middle<00:00:23.189> n<00:00:23.340> so

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
selectors here ABCD and and middle n so

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.880 
selectors here ABCD and and middle n so
we're<00:00:23.939> gonna<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.359> middle<00:00:24.720> inning<00:00:25.080> today

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
we're gonna do some middle inning today

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.140 
we're gonna do some middle inning today
but<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> set<00:00:27.000> up

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
but first of all we're going to set up

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.130 
but first of all we're going to set up
some<00:00:27.330> pattern<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> pattern<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:30.140> sure

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
some pattern so a pattern a here sure

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.780 
some pattern so a pattern a here sure
with<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> will<00:00:31.619> leave<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.009> out<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
with it will leave it out there so if we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
with it will leave it out there so if we
go<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> patent<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:36.660> should<00:00:36.719> start

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
go to patent be now we should start

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.430 
go to patent be now we should start
adding<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.680> bits<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.040> pieces<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> bit<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
adding some bits and pieces so a bit of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.100 
adding some bits and pieces so a bit of
16th<00:00:41.070> high<00:00:41.280> hat<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.329> course<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.809> go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
16th high hat or of course we could go

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:55.549 
16th high hat or of course we could go
like<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:49.700> and<00:00:51.949> let's<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.989> patency<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.379> go

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like this and let's see patency will go

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860 
like this and let's see patency will go
a<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:55.920> mad<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:57.030> things<00:00:57.510> going

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a bit more mad that these things going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.160 
a bit more mad that these things going
again<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.500> air<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:04.250> snare<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.750> patent

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
again and some air so snare and patent

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
again and some air so snare and patent
day<00:01:07.470> we'll<00:01:07.830> set<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.100> some<00:01:08.479> double<00:01:09.479> dickies<00:01:09.840> i

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
day we'll set up some double dickies i

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:23.950 
day we'll set up some double dickies i
think<00:01:17.119> and<00:01:18.119> also<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:19.490> 12<00:01:20.490> 11<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.619> also<00:01:23.070> also

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
think and also on 12 11 and also also

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:36.530 
think and also on 12 11 and also also
unpacking<00:01:24.960> g<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.860> put<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> we've<00:01:36.299> set<00:01:36.329> up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
unpacking g will put in so we've set up

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
unpacking g will put in so we've set up
our<00:01:36.810> first<00:01:37.140> four<00:01:37.530> patterns<00:01:37.799> they're<00:01:38.100> just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
our first four patterns they're just

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.490 
our first four patterns they're just
quickly<00:01:38.720> now<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.409> stuff

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
quickly now you know all the cool stuff

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.149 
quickly now you know all the cool stuff
you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.600> with<00:01:42.600> their<00:01:42.930> gum<00:01:43.140> drops<00:01:43.439> hmm

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you can do with with their gum drops hmm

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can do with with their gum drops hmm
that's<00:01:44.640> probably<00:01:45.000> bit<00:01:45.149> quiet<00:01:45.390> isn't<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that's probably bit quiet isn't it you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.270 
that's probably bit quiet isn't it you
know<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> cool<00:01:46.710> stuff<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
know all the cool stuff you can do a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
know all the cool stuff you can do a
gumdrop<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.630> mmm

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
gumdrop so what we're going to do mmm

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920 
gumdrop so what we're going to do mmm
he's<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.360> program<00:01:51.780> this

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
he's not going to like the program this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.999 
he's not going to like the program this
stuff<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> know<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.740> pretty<00:01:52.920> much

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
stuff but you know you can pretty much

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.630 
stuff but you know you can pretty much
program<00:01:53.460> everything<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.720> way<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but i'm gonna do the middle in so that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.359 
but i'm gonna do the middle in so that
because<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.250> I've

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.400 
we want to hit midi here and we're you
can<00:02:18.239> see<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.629> disabled<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.200> midi

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
can see you have disabled your midi

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.930 
can see you have disabled your midi
controller<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:20.010> enable<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.700> want<00:02:20.879> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
and then you can send a MIDI note here
and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.060> choose<00:02:30.239> your<00:02:30.390> channel<00:02:30.750> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and then you can choose your channel and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.290 
and then you can choose your channel and
its<00:02:31.410> whist<00:02:31.680> compatible<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.550> well<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> know

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
its whist compatible as well so you know

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.119 
its whist compatible as well so you know
if<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.510> want<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:34.110> you've<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.319> another<00:02:34.709> ipad

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
if you want if you've got another ipad

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.820 
if you want if you've got another ipad
and<00:02:35.310> you've<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:37.019> ik<00:02:37.230> oscillator

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
and you've got like the ik oscillator

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.290 
and you've got like the ik oscillator
then<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:38.550> good<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.760> go<00:02:38.849> with<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.209> that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
then you're good to go with all that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540 
then you're good to go with all that
anything<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.810> does<00:02:40.080> list<00:02:40.349> but<00:02:41.010> we're<00:02:41.220> only

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
anything that does list but we're only

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.130 
anything that does list but we're only
concerned<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.209> learning<00:02:42.780> gone<00:02:42.930> midi

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
concerned with learning gone midi

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
concerned with learning gone midi
controller<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.800> lame<00:02:44.010> midi<00:02:44.250> controller<00:02:44.660> now

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
controller so lame midi controller now

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.059 
controller so lame midi controller now
these<00:02:45.780> are<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.170> things<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.739> can<00:02:46.950> learn

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
these are the things that you can learn

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.949 
these are the things that you can learn
you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.519> set<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> swing<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.510> can<00:02:48.690> set<00:02:48.870> your

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
you can set the swing you can set your

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.770 
you can set the swing you can set your
pattern<00:02:49.319> controls<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:51.540> first

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
pattern controls and on and on so first

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.750 
pattern controls and on and on so first

this one this one and this one and if we
wanted<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.670> control<00:04:01.330> our<00:04:01.540> pan<00:04:01.990> for<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.800> we

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
wanted to control our pan for that we

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.990 
wanted to control our pan for that we
could<00:04:03.340> use<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:05.800> one<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.490> so<00:04:06.670> on<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:06.940> so

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
could use this one and so on and so

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.450 
could use this one and so on and so
forth<00:04:07.120> until<00:04:07.510> you've<00:04:07.840> run<00:04:08.080> out<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.460> controls

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
forth until you've run out of controls

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.670 
forth until you've run out of controls
not<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.390> lot<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:11.020> course<00:04:11.230> I<00:04:11.320> can<00:04:11.470> do<00:04:11.560> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
not a lot of and of course I can do the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.660 
not a lot of and of course I can do the
swing<00:04:11.950> as<00:04:12.190> well<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.550> BPM<00:04:13.150> here<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.640> let<00:04:15.640> me

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
swing as well and BPM here so let me

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.640 
swing as well and BPM here so let me
just<00:04:15.850> see<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.209> BPM<00:04:16.690> there<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.140> I<00:04:17.260> do<00:04:17.320> this

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
just see the BPM there so if I do this

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.510 
just see the BPM there so if I do this
for<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.870> i'm<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:19.930> sure<00:04:20.140> if<00:04:20.650> how<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.280> works

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
for that i'm not sure if how that works

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.900 
for that i'm not sure if how that works
actually<00:04:21.850> bought<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:23.590> doesn't<00:04:23.920> matter<00:04:24.070> so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
actually bought it doesn't matter so

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.030 
actually bought it doesn't matter so
we're<00:04:25.210> done<00:04:25.240> oh<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.320> overall<00:04:26.650> mix

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
we're done oh and the overall mix

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.000 
we're done oh and the overall mix
actually<00:04:27.640> will<00:04:27.760> set<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> overall<00:04:28.450> mix<00:04:28.660> to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
actually will set the overall mix to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.450 
actually will set the overall mix to

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
now if you remember in patent d we set

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.330 
now if you remember in patent d we set
up<00:05:21.130> some<00:05:21.580> toms<00:05:22.000> as<00:05:22.300> well<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.750> i<00:05:23.310> selected<00:05:24.310> the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
up some toms as well and i selected the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:34.800 
up some toms as well and i selected the
mixer<00:05:24.760> for<00:05:24.790> their<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:26.200> let's<00:05:26.410> just<00:05:33.570> mix<00:05:34.570> the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810
