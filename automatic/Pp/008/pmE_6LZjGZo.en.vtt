00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
somewhat who didn't so taking that into

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.330 
somewhat who didn't so taking that into
consideration<00:04:12.440> what<00:04:13.440> number<00:04:13.829> would<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.040> give

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
consideration what number would you give

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.020 
consideration what number would you give
overall<00:04:15.120> I'd<00:04:15.239> probably<00:04:15.390> give<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> 6<00:04:17.669> I

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
overall I'd probably give it like a 6 I

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.120 
overall I'd probably give it like a 6 I
think<00:04:18.180> I'd<00:04:18.690> give<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.109> seven<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> half<00:04:19.770> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
think I'd give it a seven and a half I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.330 
think I'd give it a seven and a half I
really<00:04:20.970> liked<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:22.320> lemon<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
true if I were to take the ones that I

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.730 
true if I were to take the ones that I
didn't<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.240> out<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.810> would<00:04:27.960> be<00:04:28.080> way<00:04:28.470> higher

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
didn't like out it would be way higher

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.100 
didn't like out it would be way higher
but<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.520> definitely<00:04:29.880> prefer<00:04:30.360> them<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.780> like

think I'm gonna have to give it an 8 I

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.740 
think I'm gonna have to give it an 8 I
really<00:04:52.830> liked<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.220> texture<00:04:53.540> definitely<00:04:54.540> but

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
really liked the texture definitely but

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.600 
really liked the texture definitely but
like<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.020> think<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.860> tastes<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.340> little<00:04:56.430> bit

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
like I think that it tastes a little bit

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.400 
like I think that it tastes a little bit
weird<00:04:56.790> at<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:56.940> beginning<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.810> does<00:04:58.020> like

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
weird at the beginning and it does like

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.140 
weird at the beginning and it does like
like<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.040> don't<00:04:59.100> think<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.490> would<00:04:59.639> really<00:04:59.760> eat<00:05:00.030> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
like I don't think I would really eat it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.219 
like I don't think I would really eat it
that<00:05:00.330> much<00:05:00.570> all<00:05:01.290> right<00:05:01.500> last<00:05:01.860> one<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:03.750> lion

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
that much all right last one the lion

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.870 
that much all right last one the lion
bar<00:05:06.229> it's<00:05:07.229> taking<00:05:07.770> me<00:05:07.860> forever<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.310> chew<00:05:08.580> I

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
bar it's taking me forever to chew I

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.300 
bar it's taking me forever to chew I
think<00:05:09.180> there's<00:05:09.360> like<00:05:09.510> not<00:05:09.919> there's<00:05:10.919> too<00:05:11.130> much

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
think there's like not there's too much

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.670 
think there's like not there's too much
inside<00:05:11.880> for<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.900> amount<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.229> chocolate

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
inside for the amount of chocolate

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.310 
inside for the amount of chocolate
that's<00:05:13.830> on<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.070> outside<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.639> think<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:14.970> ratio

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
that's on the outside I think the ratio

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.590 
that's on the outside I think the ratio
what<00:05:16.320> am<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.500> really<00:05:16.770> off<00:05:17.100> yeah<00:05:17.669> but<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.030> like<00:05:18.360> all

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
what am I really off yeah but I like all

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.330 
what am I really off yeah but I like all
the<00:05:18.720> ingredients<00:05:18.840> together<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:19.919> didn't<00:05:20.190> really

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
the ingredients together I didn't really

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.000 
the ingredients together I didn't really
