star school news for style week for he

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.420 
star school news for style week for he
does<00:04:58.490> cost<00:04:58.819> a<00:04:59.000> bit<00:04:59.120> 15k<00:04:59.870> around<00:05:00.169> about<00:05:00.409> 85<00:05:01.159> pace

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
does cost a bit 15k around about 85 pace

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.480 
does cost a bit 15k around about 85 pace
aight<00:05:01.699> dribbling<00:05:02.389> but<00:05:02.539> that<00:05:02.689> pace<00:05:02.930> is

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
aight dribbling but that pace is

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.459 
aight dribbling but that pace is
definitely<00:05:04.490> not<00:05:04.699> what<00:05:04.939> it's<00:05:05.300> like<00:05:05.479> in<00:05:05.810> game<00:05:06.020> 85

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
definitely not what it's like in game 85

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:08.709 
definitely not what it's like in game 85
you<00:05:07.219> know<00:05:07.370> it's<00:05:07.580> average<00:05:08.090> pace<00:05:08.330> when<00:05:08.599> you're

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
you know it's average pace when you're

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.779 
you know it's average pace when you're
looking<00:05:08.930> at<00:05:09.020> sweaty<00:05:09.349> strikers<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.039> stuff<00:05:10.340> but
