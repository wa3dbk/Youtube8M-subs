to<00:02:14.810> smithereens<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.410> says<00:02:15.620> yes<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.040> smash<00:02:16.310> to

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
to smithereens that says yes to smash to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.210 
to smithereens that says yes to smash to
smithereens<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:17.030> his<00:02:17.150> board<00:02:17.450> uh<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.980> is

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
smithereens at his board uh that that is

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.060 
smithereens at his board uh that that is
it<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.990> useful<00:02:21.140> furyk<00:02:21.500> vortex<00:02:21.860> that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
it so it's useful furyk vortex that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.980 
it so it's useful furyk vortex that
would<00:02:22.340> turn<00:02:22.460> off<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> life<00:02:22.880> game<00:02:23.150> which<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.900> a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
would turn off the life game which is a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.630 
would turn off the life game which is a
serious<00:02:24.320> problem<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:24.860> not<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.100> only<00:02:25.490> problem

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
serious problem but not the only problem

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.060 
serious problem but not the only problem
it's<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.930> potential<00:02:27.440> pump<00:02:27.710> for<00:02:27.860> 12

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
it's the the potential pump for 12

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's the the potential pump for 12
that's<00:02:28.400> sitting<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.820> table<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
that's sitting on the table it's the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.780 
that's sitting on the table it's the
more<00:02:30.260> pertinent<00:02:30.440> end<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.340> problem<00:02:31.520> so

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
more pertinent end of that problem so

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.610 
more pertinent end of that problem so
yeah<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.060> basically<00:02:32.420> smash<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.470> smithereens

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
yeah it's basically smash to smithereens

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.560 
yeah it's basically smash to smithereens
