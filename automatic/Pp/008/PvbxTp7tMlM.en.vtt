off<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.590> side<00:01:24.800> here<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.880> let's<00:01:26.000> pull<00:01:26.300> this

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
off the side here so let's pull this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.440 
off the side here so let's pull this
back<00:01:26.659> up

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
back up

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.660

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
let's go here so taking a look at the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.370 
let's go here so taking a look at the
tablet<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.119> kind<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.539> see<00:01:31.750> actually<00:01:32.140> from

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
tablet you can kind of see actually from

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.800 
tablet you can kind of see actually from
the<00:01:32.560> display<00:01:33.549> that<00:01:33.729> it's<00:01:34.149> only<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.450> skinny

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
the display that it's only a skinny

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.330 
the display that it's only a skinny
blondes<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:35.289> not<00:01:35.409> actually<00:01:35.799> a<00:01:35.829> full<00:01:36.100> blush

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
blondes it's not actually a full blush

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.690 
blondes it's not actually a full blush
and<00:01:36.759> though<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.329> tablet<00:01:37.659> is<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> bit<00:01:38.049> thick

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and though the tablet is a bit thick

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.709 
and though the tablet is a bit thick
when<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.789> have<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.060> your<00:01:40.179> hand<00:01:40.450> it's

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
when you have it in your hand it's

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.569 
when you have it in your hand it's
probably<00:01:41.020> about<00:01:41.110> 900<00:01:41.979> grams<00:01:42.219> so<00:01:42.460> it's

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
probably about 900 grams so it's

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.460 
probably about 900 grams so it's
actually<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:43.479> par<00:01:43.869> with<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:44.049> lot<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.229> the

concerned<00:01:57.369> about<00:01:57.429> security<00:01:57.759> here<00:01:58.630> we<00:01:58.780> have

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
concerned about security here we have

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.960 
concerned about security here we have
this<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.469> volume<00:01:59.829> up<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.159> down<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:00.939> we

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
this is a volume up and down and if we

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.359 
this is a volume up and down and if we
hold<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:01.569> and<00:02:02.080> go<00:02:02.229> up<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.590> down<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:03.009> actually

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
hold this and go up and down is actually

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.550 
hold this and go up and down is actually
does<00:02:03.490> brightness<00:02:03.939> as<00:02:04.330> well<00:02:04.869> oh<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.349> actually

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
does brightness as well oh it actually

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.020 
does brightness as well oh it actually
apparently<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.329> switch

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
apparently it's in the switch

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
apparently it's in the switch
I<00:02:09.119> still<00:02:09.630> really<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.110> way<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.470> pull

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I still really like the way you can pull

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.190 
I still really like the way you can pull
in<00:02:10.770> from<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> side<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.550> Oh<00:02:11.930> think<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.020> might

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
in from the side there Oh think I might

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.970 
in from the side there Oh think I might
have<00:02:13.850> oh<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:16.080> might<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.350> done<00:02:16.440> some<00:02:16.620> door

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
have oh I might have done some door

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.490 
have oh I might have done some door
there<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.340> go

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
there we go

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740 
there we go
so<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.340> obviously<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> prototype<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so this is obviously is a prototype of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
so this is obviously is a prototype of
bow<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.200> windows<00:02:21.830> 8<00:02:22.010> running<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.460> tablet

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
bow of windows 8 running on this tablet

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.780 
bow of windows 8 running on this tablet
so<00:02:23.570> now<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.750> we<00:02:23.780> look<00:02:23.870> around<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.320> bottom

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
so now if we look around the bottom

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.560 
so now if we look around the bottom
actually<00:02:25.790> we'll<00:02:25.910> look<00:02:25.970> at<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.210> one<00:02:26.420> because

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
actually we'll look at this one because

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.630 
actually we'll look at this one because
this<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:26.900> more<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.590> an<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.770> more<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.580> a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
this is more of an a more of a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.490 
this is more of an a more of a
distributed<00:02:29.120> product<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.260> see

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
distributed product so here we can see

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
distributed product so here we can see
we've<00:02:30.650> got<00:02:30.680> speakers<00:02:31.160> along<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> bottom

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
we've got speakers along the bottom

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
we've got speakers along the bottom
there's<00:02:32.870> two<00:02:33.020> switches<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.710> can<00:02:33.830> be

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
there's two switches here you can be

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.030 
there's two switches here you can be
seen

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
seen

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.840 
seen
just<00:02:36.219> wait<00:02:36.370> let's<00:02:36.640> focus

just wait let's focus
Sylvia<00:02:39.450> two<00:02:39.720> switches<00:02:40.050> there<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.410> can

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
Sylvia two switches there and you can

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.440 
Sylvia two switches there and you can
see<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:40.950> one<00:02:41.130> here<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.640> 2.5<00:02:42.210> g

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
see that this one here is for the 2.5 g

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.760 
see that this one here is for the 2.5 g
and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:42.750> further<00:02:42.930> went<00:02:43.170> along<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and then further went along is for the

on the end then and then going down
along<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.580> have<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> sim<00:02:53.970> card<00:02:54.000> slot<00:02:54.390> I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
along you have a sim card slot I

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.860 
along you have a sim card slot I
mini-hdmi<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.490> microphone<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.750> is
