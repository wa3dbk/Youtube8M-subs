00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
to make crystalline sugar out of sugar

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
to make crystalline sugar out of sugar
cane<00:00:32.820> no<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.239> else<00:00:33.450> at<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> technology<00:00:34.410> for

know this is something which is a great
source<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.600> energy<00:00:39.840> if<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> mixed<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
source of energy if it is mixed with the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
source of energy if it is mixed with the
right<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> things<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.140> had<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.530> the
