the hub as I can while my right hand
goes<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.940> corner<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.660> upper<00:02:30.930> corner

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
goes to this corner the upper corner

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.860 
goes to this corner the upper corner
what<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:32.700> gonna<00:02:32.820> do<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.090> I'm<00:02:33.239> gonna<00:02:33.390> push<00:02:33.660> with

by six shelter we had to use different
length<00:02:53.370> poles<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.019> when<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
length poles in it and when you do that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.830 
length poles in it and when you do that
one<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> results<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.000> do<00:02:57.390> tend<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.750> get

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
one of the results is you do tend to get

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.350 
one of the results is you do tend to get
a<00:02:57.900> lot<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.140> tangling<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.880> when<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.120> done
