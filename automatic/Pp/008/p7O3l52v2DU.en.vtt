00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
which it does like I said use a porosity

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.730

it had that red in it and sometimes it
takes<00:06:32.120> more<00:06:33.120> times<00:06:33.480> using<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.260> to<00:06:34.440> get<00:06:34.560> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
takes more times using it to get the
