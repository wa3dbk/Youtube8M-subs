to get these off I'm gonna have to get
some<00:04:28.680> pliers<00:04:31.639> hopefully<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:32.760> works<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.570> can

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
some pliers hopefully this works I can

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.969 
some pliers hopefully this works I can
just<00:04:34.169> twist<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:38.090> work<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.330> broke<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.020> it

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
just twist that work to I broke it so it

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:41.719

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.230 
I guess they don't twist so now I'm
going<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:48.860> snap<00:04:49.860> those<00:04:50.039> in<00:04:50.280> BAM<00:04:50.669> that's
