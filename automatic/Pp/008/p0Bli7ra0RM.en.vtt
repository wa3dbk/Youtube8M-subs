00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 years in japan a legion of followers

 neither forming people and seeking each time 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.439
 improve 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 the whole boss has already graduated more than 330 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.390
 group of professionals created several 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.110

 As music will never end, it does not have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 background then I speak to chile poetry is
