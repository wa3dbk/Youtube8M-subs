00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.680
 I could not say no but there are a lot of people who exaggerate 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.549
 my time 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.270
 and especially at parties in the indoor team and up to the goal of speaking all 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.770
 world touches everybody this would not happen 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.850

 the architect 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.489
 the debt of the expected I said very well 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.150
 he has done so far haiti has not slept - here has a combination even 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.000
 in party 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.279
 I'm celebrating 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.689
 has a medium combination 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.709
 which is not very good for the throat, you're there talking, screaming there 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.099
 then she drinks the cold drink she gives the one that hit the throat 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.510
 huh 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.440
 the cold drink and the Koran that dehydrate 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 and there you will come nightfall there you want you do not sleep right you 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.099
 he is not already dealing with the iva the president fit me with the alcoholic beverage 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.519
 and it has not been around for 60 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.219
 ivair amended 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.399
 and is starting to get more and more have already given up on the sun 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:54.709
 I do not live it though it throws in everything and is heavy and screaming for power or 30 and 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.569
 declined to comment if you want to speak louder than her the song 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.959
 even more susceptible had but still missing the emerson lion half will have 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.699
 So much drink the alcoholic drink she gets here so old you go 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:08.730
 alternating with a 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.560
 one year she will always have the crisis not only for you and for others we will lose 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.799
 This year's money even makes an absurd difference. 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 look at the table come in to catch fish next to understand gas sales 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.880
 natural so dreaded councilmen 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.420
 so we'll talk a little bit about it in people who 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.110
 exaggerated and at parties that they can do 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.050
 and we will also talk about more generally although this is 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.720
 often people do not give much attention opera 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.120
 soy but it's not that important 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.140
 but I would say that the more not because I am a voice professional I think 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 everyone is a business card she is not the right the right tone is wrong 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000
 it's a sim card 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.060
 and even when I spoke here the first time nor opened technician there 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.709
 necessarily has a business card that is beautiful or ugly healthier 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.840
 it was then that they will be grandparents who presents themselves in a healthy way that gostoso 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.249
 you hear that it is well articulated well placed and has a slope in the 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.019
 bed 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.159
 then it means that this is an identity of the person 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.829
 as much as you want try to imitate singers someone wants to imitate the voice of 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.139
 There are so many people who have killed the people who do this. 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.710
 anyway every voice is a brand is a digital - this action 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.479
 digital if not necessarily the ovals need to be beautiful but it can be 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.910
 pleasing to the ears in the sales recipe in mind the famous work of here one 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.650
 tone up in the beginning 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.699
 because sometimes but it is not is such a wonderful beautiful voice 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.729
 but they still up to you with clear and good good to hear and everyone 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.319
 can do this sector can can reach this 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.379
 Oh, and you know that nice voice. 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.390
 he would say that pretty much everyone who cip much 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.890
 it's dangerous you generalize the scene is everyone sometimes has questions is 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.680
 he son of you who are harder to deal with 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.180
 wins or loses has to detect tumors of stomach and diarrhea 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
 or if you have a school van you want more is the most fanciful piece 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.560
 then you have to resort to other types of treatment not only with the 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.689
 formed 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.389
 finally we are in recess the general so the person can improve the relations 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.340
 this is not ideal the experienced coach and an intonation chapel 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.219

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.099

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.419
