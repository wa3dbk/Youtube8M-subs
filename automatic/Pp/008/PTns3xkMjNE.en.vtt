00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 he three in many ways a new bmw 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.980
 first of all because it is electric 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.349
 built with a frame completely in 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.449
 carbon but having a brand like that 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.790
 linked to performance technology 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.360
 the question is is it really a true bmw 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.190
 we are here in a square where we will do one 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.170
 driving test series to find out 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 precisely if the three of us 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.000
 and really a sports bmw I only remember 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.040
 a data from 0 100 in about 7 seconds are 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.670
 typical performance, for example of a 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.670
 clio rs 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
 let me explain to you in my head the bmw 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 are especially sports cars ad 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.280
 start with the fact that they have traction 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.020
 rear as well as cars equipped with 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 engines technologically at the top 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.380
 also the Bavarian House at the top 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.659
 in the rankings of the best brands 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.100
 automotive premiums and therefore cars 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.479
 with the propeller on the hood they also have the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 task of having to transmit one 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.409
 general feeling of quality as it is 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
 then place the bmw i3 in this 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.049
 way of making cars typical of the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.850
 German brand 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.240
 all that remains is to see how he gets on 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.240
 Street 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.050
 I'm driving the BMW i3 in a yard 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.240
 full of cones to do precisely 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.380
 acidity handling tests remember 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.280
 that the wheels are very narrow and therefore 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.710
 they also have repercussions as well 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.290
 on fuel efficiency also everything 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.330
 a speech of steering responsiveness e 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.400
 then there are the benefits because the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.979
 170 horsepower electric motor as vi 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.580
 I said before to comparable performances 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.250
 to a category of small sports cars 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 of sports territory so this is it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.850
 one side that usually electric cars 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.010
 in general ecological do not have that is 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.800
 that of performance 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
 now I will try to make an acceleration e 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.340
 then since we have it , it's traction 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.080
 rear of course the 170 horses of 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.180
 power and 250 newton meters of torque 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 give the car the typical push of the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.950
 electric motors starting for a 0 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.180
 100 km an hour from 7.2 seconds never in the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.950
 shooting that you have 3 amazes most 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.480
 sink the right foot to paint 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.640
 that surrounds you and the experience really 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.350
 strange for a strange electric car I am 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
 also the external lines of the bodywork 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.350
 that being in carbon fiber 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 allows you to do without the riser 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.650
 central and so the doors open like 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.540
 those of a wardrobe by letting in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.070
 comfortably in a cockpit with four 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.720
 real places inside I really like the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.070
 part pet recycled plastic 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.930
 upper part of the dashboard and fabrics 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.489
 of bent wood seats for the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.519
 console and the two displays of the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.519
 instrumentation 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.859
 another aspect and driving this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.260
 machine I noticed is that practically 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.719
 in the everyday road guide 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.909
 it can be used with a single pedal 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.099
 the accelerator because the brake 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.090
 practically only emergencies are used or 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.709
 to stop firmly because in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.019
 all other occasions 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 just remove the foot from the gas and the 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.859
 let's call it motor brake so that in 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.599
 reality is the regeneration of energy in 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.920
 braking 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.720
 practically stops the machine from 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.230
 alone therefore there is also a whole speech 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.799
 of comfort linked to the fact that you drive 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.799
 with only one full 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.580
 now I'm doing as you can see the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.090
 low speed maneuvers because they are there 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.610
 these are very narrow pins that 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.560
 allow one to appreciate the other 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.120
 advantage of this bmw i3 that the radius 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.010
 very low steering range because of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.760
 wheels as well as being very thin if 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 I remember correctly 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.010
 155 of sections are also from 19 or 20 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.709
 inches in diameter and therefore allow 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 in practice at the wheel 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.780
 then you see images from the outside 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.180
 to steer almost to 90 degrees and then to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.530
 turn around practically themselves now 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.740
 I try to do in a circle is a feeling 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.660
 very strange but also very pleasant of 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.419
 great maneuverability 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.550
 here is pretty much right now 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.550
 turning almost on myself 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.620
 and this is the result seen from outside 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.570
 the images are those of the video shot 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.010
 at the Frankfurt Motor Show for the first time 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.040
 that I climbed on rai three like 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.040
 passenger 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.060
 what do you say the i3 still a bmw 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.800
 permits if I think of driving pleasure 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.260
 that while being so different from one 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.790
 normal bmw does not prevent you from having fun 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.800
 little more than needs to be taken into account 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.320
 36 thousand euros for the electric version from 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.930
 120 150 km of autonomy in actual use 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.720
 or almost 41 thousand for her between features 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.830
 also of the two-cylinder petrol engine 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.270
 650 of displacement that flanks 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.370
 to the electric for autonomy 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.410
 declared 340 kilometers by exploiting 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.480
 at most the driving mode anymore 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.310
 efficient eco pro plus that disability 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.660
 also the air conditioner and with the 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.920
 ability to know about both 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.590
 versions as another means of transport 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.090
 train bus meter use after having 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.800
 parked thanks to the app on 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.950
 smartphone shot in the info system 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.950
 tel 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.670
 yes no
