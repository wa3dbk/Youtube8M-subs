00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 you are watching me success 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.840
 good morning guys I'm mister macintosh 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.700
 one hundred and today I want to show you the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.220
 novelty of ios 6 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.059
 I leave immediately by e-mail and see 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.160
 this news but what it will be practically 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.199
 there is no longer the symbol here for 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.610
 download them and maximum mail here 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:49.280
 see there is this kind of wheel that 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.199
 say hello now we have nothing 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.640
 rules also because two are not controlled 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.070
 minutes ago however then we have another 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.199
 big news than the phone one 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.049
 look at the keypad has changed 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.909
 completely this in my opinion is a 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.860
 well because that keypad was there 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:14.299
 I didn't like it so sincerely before 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:22.899
 so it is much more films on later sorry 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:25.369
 another novelty is that of safari 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.280
 you see there is no bar this bar 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.500
 hateful enough to do so and take off e 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.969
 this is a big news because to me 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.829
 did not like 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.829
 and there is even more part for navigation 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.479
 then another substantial novelty is here 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.929
 in fact, in the bar you see it touches to 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.990
 send a tweet 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:02:01.310
 then okay the messages are like before 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:05.200
 another substantial innovation here 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 ie the maps 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 as you can see the maps now you can do 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:29.659
 see you see now I pulled a 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:33.739
 random route though as you see 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:37.549
 now with tomtom you can do see 40 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.099
 meters turns slightly right into the mouth and 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.760
 so on then the agreement he made 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.569
 apple with tomtom has much has been done well 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.569
 rightly so 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.659
 and this is another novelty finally the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.220
 novelty that I think will almost interest 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.780
 all is that of the settings then 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.079
 as you see a bar above is 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.659
 changed it has become bluish then 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.200
 this does not disturb you the most 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.790
 smart that apple could think 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.069
 because so one can leave the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.230
 phone and select only a few 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.959
 numbers from which he wants to be called 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.150
 in certain hours from which then 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.829
 apple did this this 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.769
 update that we say is fine 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.170
 but there are certain things that still don't 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.730
 they run very well like me when I have 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:48.290
 done the update on my 3gs 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:53.209
 this is the 4 of an enemy that is not turning 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.579
 very well though it is ok on the 3gs second 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.280
 me does not run very well the first few times 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.930
 which is done to the bouquet that is made 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.209
 starting the phone then start to 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.780
 turn pretty decent 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.440
 however as you see purchased this is 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.129
 the store 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:16.299
 our new store ok for a moment 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:20.690
 take the shot and look at it as you see 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.910
 this store has changed so does it for 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.400
 run applications from a certain one 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.539
 point even better because yes 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.380
 however, they also upload an image 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.380
 itunes has changed as well 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:49.660
 see also itunes has changed here too 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.650
 it will turn so now sejir the albums 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.230
 have changed 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.580
 very well very well anyway 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:01.480
 finally the last novelty has changed 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.860
 very important ie very important e 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:11.350
 has revolutionized everything a bit 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.030
 especially two ie the camera and the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.910
 camcorder that are of this color 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.620
 ie below the bar is no longer gray and 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.350
 then music 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:27.370
 let's go to music there is a departure 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.160
 I randomly know why he has me 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.330
 put giorgio gaber as rock oh well 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:37.440
 let's start an iron song 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.440
 maiden the keys 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.830
 you have changed everything in fact the image 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.060
 it's not like it used to be 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.390
 that is, of another color 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.520
 and even here it has become much more beautiful 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.060
 as you see towards this he denounced 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:10.620
 no longer blue but turned orange 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:14.790
 therefore there are substantial innovations 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.900
 this new ios is 6 especially those 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.880
 of design 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.460
 we can say design interface 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.560

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.810
