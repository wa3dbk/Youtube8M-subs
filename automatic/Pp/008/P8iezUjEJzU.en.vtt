00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 lesbian 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.830
 office on isnas under me songs 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.480
 apparently 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 kriga tv and today we talk about such 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.120
 car as fri-76 is also a car of the first 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 level as well as m113 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 and actually is well maybe its 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 direct competitor but here we have 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.170
 slightly different weight categories by 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.769
 at least in size so exactly the first 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 what catches your eye is how much 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.260
 huge body of this Fri-76 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 it's just incredibly huge size and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 cardboard stoningly armor here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 Absolutely not and punch us absolutely 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.250
 all shells but of course not occasionally 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.690
 bounce but it's most likely something 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.750
 so extraordinary 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.030
 Often, of course, the damage passes to us and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 nothing nice of course about it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.560
 but here we have not 660 a820 units 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.619
 strength though whether they are worth this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.110
 increase in size well I don't know but 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.970
 here, too, everything is quite a bit wrong 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.709
 because we don't have to fight on 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.959
 first line u we can not have 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.690
 small sizes we have a long-range 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.280
 powerful gun and she of course 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.580
 must meet our expectations 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.950
 its accuracy is quite at the level 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.539
 it comes down too pretty fast and when 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.580
 this if you put a stabilizer 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.009
 pump that accuracy in general and on the go 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.259
 it will be quite a good while 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.929
 there is a new one in this configuration 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.209
 I have two types of shells it sabers 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.729
 and cumulative I quite myself successfully 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.459
 use cumulative because they 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 do some more damage but for 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.050
 achieving a more stable result 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 have to use sabot 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.160
 they are only for a few damage 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.830
 cause less but the result is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 a little more regular and if you really 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.280
 get into fights against t-62 and the like 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.170
 cars 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.260
 against a bt sabot shells 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.599
 to fight is more convenient than cumulative there 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.489
 everything is not so rosy for us but 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.140
 coming back to ours that's it from 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.569
 big boxes can be with us 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.790
 speed is good alas no we too 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.570
 I can't brag for some reason 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.610
 reminded this car to her 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.900
 the maneuver recalled a ship of some kind 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.250
 such a big group 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 he and because she really 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.860
 quite a long time turns and at the same time 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.689
 does not possess any supernatural 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.090
 speed no good mobility 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.870
 there is no no she is quite a good 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.480
 but no more than that the same m113 he is much 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.209
 Faster is faster well and smaller at the same time and 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.849
 so we can say that on it somehow 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.069
 it is easier to scout the rear here so 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.829
 definitely not worth doing because 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.890
 such a big cardboard box is not for 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.319
 Moreover, we can create it here but with more 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.810
 large percentage of probability successfully 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.930
 to amuse because one-time damage gun 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.450
 allows here we have over 200 units and 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.700
 close skirmishes against twenty 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.049
 millimeter poukalok it is absolutely not 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.599
 our method 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.639
 and not our prerogative as they say 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.069
 because we can shoot 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.439
 the enemy from a long distance when 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.230
 this with a pretty good chance to inflict 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.329
 we will have enough damage to break it 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.310
 but what else is needed for happiness of course 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.739
 do the same punch and in general all 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.900
 will we have in this regard is wonderful but 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.470
 it does not substitute too pretty 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.629
 complicated 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.579
 about any stealth on this 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.799
 unit out of the question 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.449
 and the dimensions themselves allow 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.030
 the enemy is pretty good 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.430
 unfurling towers unfortunately possesses 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.069
 us such a disadvantage that the gun down u 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.569
 We are not inclined from the word at all, and the 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.699
 there is also for the hills we like to shoot 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.430
 we can not always be open our 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:07.019
 huge body while the front part 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.690
 even if we leave somehow 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.000
 neatly board we still get 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.220
 into it before you roll your wash 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.930
 is not right here right at the beginning 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.180
 still closer to the middle of the case 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.549
 certainly not in the middle but all 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 Equal closer to that and it allows 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.630
 the enemy inflict damage on us while we 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.560
 we donâ€™t see them yet but god forbid 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.169
 us on the caterpillar 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.900
 yes it is a tracked vehicle and here you can 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.590
 write gone but such situations honestly 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.300
 in my fights 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.490
 it has not happened yet and I can safely 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.400
 state the fact that if you don't 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.729
 climb on the rampage in melee then 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.740
 all you can do is fine but 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.620
 if you try to take and order 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.750
 same m113 for example diluted on the game because of 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.340
 the house is unlikely to have it out 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.889
 likely to roll out 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.199
 and put you in a whole ribbon you most likely 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.380
 you will die from it but you will inflict two 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.419
 shot but this is not full of his efficiency and he 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.940
 come out of this fight the winner is that 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.220
 in this case you can drink 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.900
 and sew well, rather, just drag it 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.540
 we can't make stealth not 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.210
 allows but the game with some not the first 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.790
 the lines are quite self why not if 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.740
 long-range piercing guns then this 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.810
 the most for our pt 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.120
 while on the rampage of course not to climb 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.910
 not our 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.340
 armor which is not our size but here 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.100
 from some distance from the second line 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.900
 it we always please with this yes we 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.139
 can absorb some amount 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.060
 damage 820 points of strength 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.460
 hint that with one shot we donâ€™t 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.010
 leave and even if suddenly someone wants 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.320
 kill us then he will have to try 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.210
 we can commit one or two and in 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.430
 in some cases more errors and 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.070
 this to remain quite viable 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.919
 state and after that also not bad 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.960
 to kick our offender but in general 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.720
 on this machine all the whole story fits 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.360
 by the end and thats far from a breakthrough machine 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.940
 she has such a nice gun but 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.590
 while it is not quick-in 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.810
 plan if you compare it with 20 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.900
 millimeter tape counterparts and 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.849
 it actually sets our rules 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.620
 do not climb the gameplay 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.930
 forward and neatly tidy 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.479
 sideways sideways and everyone in the jug 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.190
 well with you there was a circle tv if 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.380
 the video was useful and interesting for you 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.300
 be sure to put your thumb 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.490
 I try up for you 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.729
 and bye bye see you in the fields 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.729
 battles
