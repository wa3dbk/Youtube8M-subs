00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.089
 this topic we will consider in context 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.130
 carburetor works 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.800
 basically if the engine is running in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.070
 well-established mode then carburetor like 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
 hard waga guys and don't need enough 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.940
 small tap valve 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 which we can open and close 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.859
 with a small step then once 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.420
 adjusting the supply of fuel we can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 to ensure the operation of the engine but what will 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.840
 if we make a little effort on the shaft 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.690
 engine probably engine will stop 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 Why is this happening 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 leading laboratory experiments 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.120
 engineers noticed that the engine power 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.980
 at change of turns changes too 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 if we install the device on the motor shaft 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.329
 which measures engine power and 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.820
 we will change the frequency of turns 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 the crankshaft then get this 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.160
 the schedule as we see when changing turns 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.609
 crankshaft shaft power too 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.609
 is changing 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.900
 Now let's see how the works 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.130
 engine on car while car 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.680
 standing still 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.080
 crankshaft load is small and 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.930
 constant crankshaft rotates with 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.170
 constant speed in this mode 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 enough and a poor mixture of bits of it a mixture 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.600
 it means less fuel when 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.900
 the car pulls away and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.720
 accelerates momentum grow load on 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.180
 crankshaft increases if this 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.150
 moment immeasurable quality mix then 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.720
 it turns out that it has become richer fuel 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.860
 It became a little more than before for 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.410
 To compensate 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.000
 increased load 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.910
 air-fuel mixture do a little 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.310
 richer as it is done on 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.970
 carburetor car we'll talk on 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 following lessons 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.200
 when the car moves uphill 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.260
 engine load a high revs 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 fall in this mode requires rich 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.930
 mixture 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.240
 it is important to remember that in addition to enrichment 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.420
 air-fuel mixture there are others 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.000
 ways to increase engine power 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.310
 for example, increasing the speed as seen from 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.280
 graphics engine power increases 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.080
 with increasing revolutions and to increase 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 engine speed increase 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.080
 amount of fuel-air mixture 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.030
 which is fed into the cylinders it 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.540
 by opening the throttle 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.540
 dampers 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.790
 let it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.819
 the car accelerated and continues 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.700
 constant speed driving 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:46.040
 the need for a rich mixture is eliminated and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.080
 on fuel economy the mixture is made poorer 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.959
 so on the one hand for 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.890
 compensate for increased loads 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 it is necessary to enrich the mixture 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.860
 and on the other to ensure cost effectiveness 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.620
 and environmental friendliness must be combined 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.750
 mixture therefore during operation 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.910
 car in the modes where required 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.769
 high engine power mixture 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.600
 enrich and in other modes we will get poorer 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.959
 in other words, the carburetor should work 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.360
 so that the quality of the mixture during 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.390
 first did not go beyond the permissible 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.940
 second range changed synchronously 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.670
 with the load change that is how 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.150
 load changes so much and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.489
 the quality of the mixture is such a relationship we 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 can see if we see the map 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.160
 fuel supply in the controller program 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.380
 injection car 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.930
 if you studied basic diagnostics 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.930
 there we talked about this in detail about 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.329
 injector car there is a controller 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.310
 this is the engine control unit inside 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.280
 This unit has a program with 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.700
 calibration tables and a map such 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.380
 fuel supply we see in this figure 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.329
 about the same function but more 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.329
 roughly regulates quality 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.280
 air-fuel mixture carburetor like 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.760
 we remember the carburetor car and 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.109
 appeared before the injection until 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.049
 the carburetor adjusts the quality 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.739
 multiple air-fuel mixture 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.010
 rougher 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.019
 than injection cars for 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.870
 to analyze more work 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.800
 carburetor and facilitate the search for causes 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.620
 faults 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.620
 engine operation is divided into mode and 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.260
 first mode and 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.780
 engine start engine not yet 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.290
 working we turn on the starter and twist 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.350
 crank and flash starts then 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.140
 the engine starts up here is the process between 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.570
 how the engine was not working and then 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.860
 this gap began to work 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.300
 called the engine start mode 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.080
 the next mode is idle 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.640
 This is when the car is standing still and 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.790
 engine crankshaft rotates with 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.000
 constant speed the following is 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.000
 transient mode is intermediate mode 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.630
 between idle and small mode 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.460
 loads 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.280
 when the engine is idling 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.590
 go and we start to open the throttle 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.540
 flap and starts to turn up 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.180
 the next mode is the low load mode 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.300
 this is when the car starts to slow 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.690
 acceleration or moving without acceleration after 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.710
 acceleration that is, we overclocked and then 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.720
 already keep a constant speed while 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.930
 the throttle valve opens very 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.820
 at a small angle and this is the mode 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.450
 small loads and the next is power 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.740
 my mode 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.200
 it is a sharp acceleration or uphill movement 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.680
 while on the car engine 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.540
 have a very large load this 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.310
 mode is characterized by the fact that 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.900
 the throttle valve is fully open 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.650
 or almost completely and as we are already 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.220
 talked 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:13.050
 dividing by mode and this is highly conditional and 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.750
 does not have strict evaluation criteria 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.890
 let's summarize the work of the engine conditionally 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:24.130
 divided into mode and mode of start mode 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:27.400
 idle transition mode 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.560
 small loads and powerful your mode for 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.260
 ensure change quality 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.820
 air-fuel mixture and 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.580
 the carburetor has a special device 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.610
 and the quality of the fuel-air mixture 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.040
 called the deviation of the mixture from 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.550
 metric elements 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.850
 if the proportion of air decreases or the proportion 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.880
 fuel increases this rich mixture 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.640
 and if the proportion of air increases or 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.000
 the proportion of fuel decreases then it is poor 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.880
 mixture 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.850
 you all know this art 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.030
 internal combustion engine and 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.440
 basic diagnostics in each mode 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.110
 quality of the fuel-air mixture 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.150
 have certain parameters and how 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.430
 it is ensured that these 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.740
 parameters of the engine 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.040
 we will know when we study the device 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.070
 and the carburetor's work is in the following 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.070
 lessons
