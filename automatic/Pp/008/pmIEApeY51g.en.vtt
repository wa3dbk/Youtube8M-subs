the original iPad we did a case case is
pretty<00:00:17.760> cool<00:00:18.380> can<00:00:19.380> prop<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> iPad<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.580> for

pretty<00:00:25.410> well<00:00:25.500> except<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.550> went<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.300> all

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
pretty well except that we went to all

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
pretty well except that we went to all
this<00:00:27.660> trouble<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.109> make<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> beautiful<00:00:28.650> design

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
this trouble to make a beautiful design

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.540 
this trouble to make a beautiful design
and<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.789> cover<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.599> case<00:00:31.550> right

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and we cover it up with this case right

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.930 
and we cover it up with this case right
but<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.540> than<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.290> added<00:00:35.010> thickness

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
but more than that we added thickness

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.560 
but more than that we added thickness
and<00:00:36.210> weight<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> product<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.250> we<00:00:39.180> made<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
and weight to the product and we made it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.119 
and weight to the product and we made it
more<00:00:39.750> difficult<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.350> use<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.800> some<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
more difficult to use with some of the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.450 
more difficult to use with some of the
accessories<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.530> thought<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.160> could<00:00:44.190> do

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
accessories so we thought we could do

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
accessories so we thought we could do
better<00:00:44.640> than<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.300> ipad<00:00:45.750> 2<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.230> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
better than this for ipad 2 and we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310 
better than this for ipad 2 and we
started<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.300> beginning<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
started from the very beginning to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400 
started from the very beginning to
design<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.860> case<00:00:50.420> right<00:00:51.420> alongside<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
design the case right alongside the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
design the case right alongside the
product<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.020> done<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:56.250> it's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
product and we have done that but it's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
product and we have done that but it's
not<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> case<00:00:56.910> anymore<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.079> cover<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.219> cover

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
not a case anymore it's a cover to cover

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.380 
not a case anymore it's a cover to cover

engineering<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> ID<00:01:47.610> team<00:01:48.000> came<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.390> with

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
engineering and ID team came up with

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.770 
engineering and ID team came up with
this<00:01:48.630> idea<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:49.320> magnets<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.340> grasp<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
this idea of using magnets that grasp it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.179 
this idea of using magnets that grasp it
and<00:01:52.009> auto<00:01:53.009> align<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.560> always<00:01:55.829> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and auto align it so it's always in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.539 
and auto align it so it's always in
perfect<00:01:56.460> alignment<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:58.130> I'll<00:01:59.130> show<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
perfect alignment and I'll show you a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.980 
perfect alignment and I'll show you a
little<00:01:59.729> video<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.390> won't<00:02:00.509> believe<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
little video this you won't believe it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.160 
little video this you won't believe it
it's<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.439> cool<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.270> remove<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
it's so cool and you can remove it in a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.210 
it's so cool and you can remove it in a
second<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.070> add<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.670> second<00:02:07.220> it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
second you can add it in a second it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.660 
second you can add it in a second it
adds<00:02:09.000> minimal<00:02:09.720> weight<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.229> thickness

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
adds minimal weight and thickness

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
adds minimal weight and thickness
because<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.030> covering<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> top

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
because it's just covering the top

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.339 
because it's just covering the top
it's<00:02:14.040> got<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> microfiber<00:02:15.090> lining<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.959> cleans

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
it's got a microfiber lining that cleans

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's got a microfiber lining that cleans
the<00:02:16.650> screen<00:02:17.010> every<00:02:17.370> time<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.790> move<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.150> open

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
short or something but as you see we

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.560 
short or something but as you see we
actually<00:03:49.440> built<00:03:49.800> magnets<00:03:50.610> right<00:03:50.940> into<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
actually built magnets right into the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.800 
actually built magnets right into the
iPad<00:03:52.200> itself<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:53.160> then<00:03:53.790> there's<00:03:54.000> magnets<00:03:54.630> in

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
iPad itself and then there's magnets in

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.250 
iPad itself and then there's magnets in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
the hinge for the smart cover and it not

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.170 
the hinge for the smart cover and it not

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
only holds the cover on but it auto

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.620 
only holds the cover on but it auto
aligns<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:01.040> it's<00:04:02.040> really<00:04:02.550> cool<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:05.160> course
