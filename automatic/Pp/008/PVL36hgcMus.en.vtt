00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:21.779
 the trailer is a technique to increase the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.600
 expectations of students in relation to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 text that will be read when 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 the teacher presents ideas 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 key or text key scene before 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 start reading 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 just as in movie trailers the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 scenes do not need to follow the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.430
 order of narrative very well today. 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:51.770
 reading I brought is from science today 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 of children and we are going to read a text 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:01:01.859
 about Egypt try to flame if so 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.439
 Egypt, there we go, too, so what? 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.220
 we will see in that text then in the e 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.720
 Egypt 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 We'll know a little about the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.260
 egyptian gods 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 Let's know about the pyramids. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.189
 some curiosities 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.780
 Okay, and let's also know a little bit 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.799
 about mine, who are these? 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.350
 mummy because they look like that 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.619
 if they are scary, right? 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.079
 what they are exactly alright 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.630
 so come on, I'll show you the first 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.630
 illustration 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.140
 never aspire how much the pyramids we 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.509
 we have 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.180
 we saw that the teacher presented ideas 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.399
 that will appear in the text 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 by selecting elements of interest from 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.159
 students 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 she managed to create a climate of suspense 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.850
 for an informative text and character 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.189
 scientific 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.899
 this technique can be applied to 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.899
 different types of text
