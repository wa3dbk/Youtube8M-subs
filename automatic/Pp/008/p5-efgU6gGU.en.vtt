00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
distract Ecco from his ultimate prize
so<00:01:23.340> he<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> work<00:01:24.270> pawing<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so he got right back to work pawing and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429 
so he got right back to work pawing and
diving<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.790> took<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.810> but

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
diving it took a bit of time but

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
diving it took a bit of time but
eventually<00:01:28.590> Ecco<00:01:29.100> realized<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:29.850> could<00:01:30.000> drag

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
eventually Ecco realized he could drag

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
eventually Ecco realized he could drag
the<00:01:30.479> ball<00:01:30.630> closer<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> shore<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.070> his

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the ball closer to shore to make his

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.910 
the ball closer to shore to make his
dives<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:33.180> easier<00:01:33.710> once<00:01:34.710> he<00:01:34.799> got

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
dives a little bit easier once he got

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
dives a little bit easier once he got
the<00:01:35.070> ball<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.640> figured<00:01:36.150> echo<00:01:36.299> would

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the ball I figured echo would

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
the ball I figured echo would
triumphantly<00:01:37.140> chomp<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> sand<00:01:38.310> but

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
triumphantly chomp on it in the sand but

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
triumphantly chomp on it in the sand but
he<00:01:39.060> went<00:01:39.210> right<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:39.990> dropped<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
he went right back out and dropped it in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.300 
he went right back out and dropped it in
the<00:01:40.740> water<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.250> he<00:01:41.310> could<00:01:41.460> dive<00:01:41.670> again<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
the water so he could dive again and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.690 
the water so he could dive again and
again<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:47.390> again

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.510 

I<00:01:51.079> guess<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.229> was<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.350> another<00:01:52.920> reminder

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I guess it was just another reminder

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
I guess it was just another reminder
that<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.850> fun<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> life<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> catch

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that the fun in life is not the catch

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.190 
that the fun in life is not the catch
but<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> chase<00:01:56.219> hope<00:01:57.180> everyone<00:01:57.600> chases<00:01:58.049> after

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but the chase hope everyone chases after

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.250 
but the chase hope everyone chases after
a<00:01:58.380> fun<00:01:58.710> weekend
