up<00:00:37.469> his<00:00:37.590> rocks<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.190> crit<00:00:38.520> him<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.760> an<00:00:38.850> ice<00:00:38.969> beam

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
up his rocks I crit him with an ice beam

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.410 
up his rocks I crit him with an ice beam
so<00:00:40.070> I'm<00:00:41.070> able<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.520> kill<00:00:41.730> him<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.000> another<00:00:42.149> ice

so I'm able to kill him with another ice
beam<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:43.440> not<00:00:43.800> sure<00:00:44.070> how<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.700> actually

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
beam I'm not sure how much that actually

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.610 
beam I'm not sure how much that actually
mattered<00:00:45.329> because<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.079> balloon

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
mattered because I did have my balloon

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.510 
mattered because I did have my balloon
but<00:00:47.329> he<00:00:48.329> brings<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.840> his<00:00:49.140> teriyaki<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.190> I've

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
but he brings in his teriyaki so I've

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.810 
but he brings in his teriyaki so I've
got<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> switch<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.750> go<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.140> sistas<00:00:52.440> or

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
got to switch out I go to my sistas or

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.310 
got to switch out I go to my sistas or
expecting<00:00:53.820> him<00:00:53.969> maybe<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> rot<00:00:54.690> polish<00:00:55.170> with

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
expecting him maybe to rot polish with

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
expecting him maybe to rot polish with
swords<00:00:55.680> dance<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> could<00:00:56.520> hopefully

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
swords dance so that I could hopefully

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
swords dance so that I could hopefully
kill<00:00:57.239> him<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> bullet<00:00:57.870> punch<00:00:58.109> but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
kill him off with a bullet punch but

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.529 
kill him off with a bullet punch but
instead<00:00:58.710> he<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.340> goes<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.180> close

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
instead he just goes for the close

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.740 
instead he just goes for the close
combat<00:01:00.870> which<00:01:01.699> almost<00:01:02.699> kills<00:01:03.210> me<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
with a close-combat which does a lot

with a close-combat which does a lot
more<00:02:20.049> than<00:02:20.109> I<00:02:20.379> expected<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:22.269> actually

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
more than I expected and it actually

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.539 
more than I expected and it actually
kills<00:02:22.989> me<00:02:23.319> thought<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.709> that's<00:02:23.859> not<00:02:24.040> too<00:02:24.250> good

Dory<00:02:47.500> yuzu<00:02:48.040> which<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.549> thought<00:02:49.359> I<00:02:49.389> might

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
Dory yuzu which I thought I might

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.319 
Dory yuzu which I thought I might
survive<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.230> rock<00:02:50.560> slide<00:02:50.769> from<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:51.639> I<00:02:51.669> guess<00:02:52.180> I

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
survive a rock slide from but I guess I

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.659 
survive a rock slide from but I guess I
was<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.599> crack<00:02:53.019> because<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.950> didn't<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.549> then<00:02:54.609> I

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:54.669 
was on crack because I didn't and then I

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.059 
was on crack because I didn't and then I
see<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:54.939> life<00:02:55.150> orb<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.319> really<00:02:56.799> wouldn't

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
see the life orb so I really wouldn't

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.099 
see the life orb so I really wouldn't
survive<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.879> I<00:02:57.909> just<00:02:58.209> bring<00:02:58.359> an<00:02:58.510> item<00:02:58.629> ranit

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
survive so I just bring an item ranit

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.509 
survive so I just bring an item ranit
are<00:02:59.260> hoping<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.709> finish<00:02:59.859> him<00:03:00.129> off<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.310> a

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.800 
superpower because i can dodge
earthquake<00:03:02.470> with<00:03:02.650> my<00:03:02.799> balloon<00:03:03.159> but<00:03:03.599> he<00:03:04.599> hits

pokemon<00:03:11.889> online<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.669> I<00:03:12.879> guess<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.480> must<00:03:13.780> have

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
pokemon online so I guess that must have

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.520 
pokemon online so I guess that must have
been<00:03:14.019> max<00:03:14.260> damage<00:03:14.530> or<00:03:14.829> something<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:16.629> I'm<00:03:17.139> just

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
been max damage or something so I'm just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.170 
been max damage or something so I'm just
gonna<00:03:17.650> bring<00:03:17.889> in<00:03:18.010> my<00:03:18.129> own<00:03:18.159> door<00:03:18.549> yuzu<00:03:18.909> who's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
gonna bring in my own door yuzu who's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.930 
gonna bring in my own door yuzu who's
floating<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.659> a<00:03:19.690> balloon<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.560> kill<00:03:21.489> him<00:03:21.729> and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
floating on a balloon to kill him and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.699 
floating on a balloon to kill him and
dodge<00:03:22.359> his<00:03:22.629> earthquake<00:03:23.019> but<00:03:23.260> instead<00:03:23.560> he

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
dodge his earthquake but instead he

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.159 
dodge his earthquake but instead he
brings<00:03:23.979> in<00:03:24.159> this<00:03:24.250> random<00:03:24.729> rosu<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.299> figured<00:03:26.109> it

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
brings in this random rosu I figured it

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.330 
brings in this random rosu I figured it
would<00:03:26.319> have<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.620> use<00:03:26.769> Stone<00:03:27.069> Edge<00:03:27.099> or

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
would have to use Stone Edge or

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.860 
would have to use Stone Edge or
something<00:03:27.609> first<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:28.000> rate<00:03:28.180> my<00:03:28.299> balloon<00:03:28.659> so<00:03:28.840> I

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
something first to rate my balloon so I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.479 
something first to rate my balloon so I
went<00:03:29.049> for<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.319> swords<00:03:29.650> dance<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.069> he<00:03:30.220> hits<00:03:30.400> me

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
went for the swords dance and he hits me

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.960 
went for the swords dance and he hits me
with<00:03:30.639> a<00:03:30.699> freaking<00:03:31.150> focus<00:03:31.599> blast<00:03:31.810> which<00:03:32.229> I<00:03:32.970> have

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
with a freaking focus blast which I have

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.300 
with a freaking focus blast which I have
not<00:03:34.269> actually<00:03:34.329> seen<00:03:34.840> before<00:03:35.560> but<00:03:36.010> I'm

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
not actually seen before but I'm

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.270 
not actually seen before but I'm
guessing<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.629> means<00:03:37.900> he's<00:03:38.349> probably<00:03:38.650> like

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
guessing that means he's probably like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.699

specs<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.269> encouraged<00:03:40.840> or<00:03:41.019> something<00:03:41.440> and

specs with encouraged or something and

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.520 
specs with encouraged or something and

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
against my little blob thing pretty much

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.909 
against my little blob thing pretty much
confirms<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.319> get<00:03:50.500> up<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> calm
