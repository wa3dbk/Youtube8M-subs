00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.349

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.180
 fresh cheese with herbs further flavored 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.649
 with herbs is with dill and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.010
 olive oil 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 I did the fried a few 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 Normally you can see the curves in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 make a pan you can eat the cold 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 you can eat the warm and I very much 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.890
 Today as a main course as a warm 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.220
 main course with the salad and first 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.439
 I have to peel the potatoes and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.549
 then into a centimeter-sized cube 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 cut then come on a 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.340
 baking tray with a bit of olive oil and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.830
 I have the herd already preheated 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 because the potatoes need something 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.759
 longer than I had salmon preheated 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 to 200 degrees 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.040
 then come the diced potatoes 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 for about 15 minutes in the oven like that 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:46.110
 potatoes I have the dice bit 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:49.200
 Then olive oil comes over and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.939
 then as I said in the preheated oven 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 at 200 degrees 15 minutes and in the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.270
 in the meantime I can get the dax 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.549
 to prepare 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 I'm cutting the brown spots here 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.040
 out tastes harnik and salmon 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 I then dice in about 2 cm 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.880
 big pieces 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.069
 I 've got cream cheese with me now 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.250
 the sour cream in a mix cup 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.810
 she does it powerfully 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.530
 seasoned with salt pepper and nutmeg 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.620
 now come a row to mine 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.640
 Potatoes are already 15 minutes in the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.989
 oven been in there I have one 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 Casserole filled the herbs I have 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.390
 sliced 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.800
 the peas that have frozen in the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 Let me have a look 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.090
 then come because the herbs to 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:04:10.630
 here comes the salmon spread it 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:10.630
 evenly more or less 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.630
 here is also the salt and 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.630
 peppery 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:50.790
 and then I have the mixed eggs 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:54.000
 I said it is temperature 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:58.260
 I reset to 120 degrees 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.470
 top down heat and now comes the form 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.300
 purely for about 35 to 45 minutes and 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.220
 then the free tat stops now 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.740
 that will not grow or be fried 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.420
 but of the stick only and when it too 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.960
 already finished then see you later 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.940
 again so the free theater is now 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.250
 finished you have to pay attention to that 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.890
 that really stopped it is supposed to be nothing 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.990
 more fluid to be there in such a 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.240
 big smokes in front of or in such a 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.010
 thick before needs something more in his 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:34.200
 Great shape then it stops 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.480
 faster, so check it out again 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.930
 that should be stopped that looks delicious 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.660
 I made it today as the main course 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.580
 it is he who is with the salad it tasted 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.730
 It was not hard at all and as always 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.040
 can read the fool recipe quantity 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.700
