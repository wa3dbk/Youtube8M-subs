00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.670
 Welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.269
 fitness better so I am packing today 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.110
 I really delicious for you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.369
 thicker pancakes and how the whole 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.140
 I'll show you that right away 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.210
 Whole is not low carb though 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 fitness suitable so be in the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:30.640
 comparison are two unclear 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:36.520
 80 of these are called the flowers tender 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.110
 oatmeal and 50 grams of your 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.710
 favorite protein powder 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.350
 the thicker the consistency is so from the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.090
 protein powder the less you need 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.980
 of this in the powder and the thinner the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.870
 For example, consistency is shakes 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.910
 the more needed of powder 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.219
 we give 250 and then look 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.070
 Let's get straight to the consistency of 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.760
 we start massively 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.010
 First of all, if I have the eggs 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 I do not think I have to cry 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.170
 that gives you now in this bowl the 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.929
 you have prepared then you take one 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:35.319
 Small brand would now have 80 grams of 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:42.000
 The flowers were packed with delicate oatmeal 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:42.000
 also to go with it the protein 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.539
 you must have 50 grams of a coupon 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:58.869
 about 30 grams so not more than 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:03.819
 the other half for stirring 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.409
 I now with a whisk I have 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.299
 here of course I forgot about that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.160
 need only 100 milliliters 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:23.680
 water that whole wants there now 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:27.940
 through her you can also do another 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.290
 take the taste I took now 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.620
 grease and grease the pan with it 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.209
 on 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.349
 since you take the whole mass and 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.349
 distribute them on this separation 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.569
 the mass should be about 1 centimeter thick 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.659
 so be it from the inside 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.079
 By doing that, you're best at covering it up with this 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.180
 Think of a glass and wait around 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.790
 to two minutes from the one to the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.609
 from the one side slightly seared 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.010
 and then you will do the whole thing if that 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:20.310
 dough now begins to blow lightly 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.310
 can you select all also turn 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.879
 just look at these mega fat ones 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.310
 monster pancake at that's probably 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:37.180
 at least to get really horny 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.720
 1 cm thick for true guys or for 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.000
 women who pump well go have fun 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.290
 when copying 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.750
 who in any case not advertised 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.329
 this is a really delicious part 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 So let me thumb up and we 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.569
 See you next time again 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.720
 small tip on the edge I have for you 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.150
 that prepares who the whole thing too much 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.389
 was too powerful that can be small 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.949
 Cut out protein bars and add to that 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.959
 Take the example with you for work 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.440
 but you have to cool that down 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.949
 to let 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.949
 So again have fun until then
