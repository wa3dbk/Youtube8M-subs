00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome back and welcome to this new me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.899
 video today for the first time 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.910
 we are here to mine is not based on 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.830
 horror games but you never are 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.900
 seen comparison then this says 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.969
 guys discussed below though maybe 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 my intention is not one of the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.260
 better but if you can try turning it off 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.570
 this bulb was seen so then 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.359
 what sense does it have maybe we can't too 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.849
 try it right then seen this way 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.470
 some gameplay therefore practically not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.510
 we are playing the first time and there 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 so let's play a bit 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.880
 we always keep the light on and go 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 forward and in any case it's a room 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 quite closed there are no runners 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 I would know which one to choose 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.989
 anyway we have the right as always you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 you know wait with the button to go 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.480
 which cell space 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:57.870
 no it does not run a perfect oh with anyway 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.430
 this pulls me today I played as well 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.430

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:10.130
 lower or god you do not go light and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.130
 what a fucking judgment I was taking 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:34.630

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.690
 which then is the torch is always a 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:56.110
 lighter I don't know about you but a man has me 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.110
 put in a prison is a madhouse 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.060
 today they seem to sell off this kind of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 game 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:24.050

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.630
 this is where it beats me a thousand 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.700
 I can't take the acid straw 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.220

 I can't see today what we have to do with it 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.470
 I don't always walk straight ahead 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 so at least it appears before me 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.550
 I see why if you suddenly give it to me 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.750

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.730

 I don't know what the fuck happened anyway 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:03.230
 continuous continues another time one is 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.230
 stuck because he doesn't run in front of me 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.720
 what the fuck is blocked as many guys 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.720

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.300

 away away run run run rabbit 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.140
 I still look for that character I think 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.520
 that does not even run did not jump for the 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.730
 wrong time crush a few keys 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.120
 in fact, non- tie jokes I won't say 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.810
 the arctic we go let's go there anyway 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.120
 wall 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:10.010
 no no no, here I went before and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:11.900
 even porous lemons with my son not 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.680
 I have to hear poletti and he has no real non 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.680
 I see I do not see is turned and turned or 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 goodbye 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.760
 and a little breath I don't want to die of 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.950
 heart attack as already happened before 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.080
 oh my god no no no me with true i don't 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.110
 I see I do not see 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.680
 nasty bitch but closed but locked away 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.960
 my escapes run away and I see it in front of me 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.810
 I bet the balls that now wins 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.140
 in front of him this year the le comes out 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:55.180
 cages oh well then we went by radar 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:58.580
 hearts remain and stalin and unjust 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.320
 on the average, the exhortation seeks to 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.440
 amuse myself dental just from not 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.970
 think about it because really if you see 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.690
 check pants that I ca n't find 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.690
 own shit too 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.400
 Amnesty broadens the perfect game to me 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.460
 I see all shots in total precisely that 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.460
 we see him away from San Carlo 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.460
 no I keep pulling continue to 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.930
 turn 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.570
 I don't know what sense this game has but 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.350
 we must always turn beautiful on a 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.430
 There was a map of type maze 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:54.680
 however, to do something concrete 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:57.790
 but excuse a bigger torch not 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.790
 you could take it 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:16.770
 there's blood here you don't want blood 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:19.469
 do ok we passed there is nothing to 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:23.610
 take if you were to take it 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:25.979
 I don't like the blood pages when it's there 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.939
 blood rate or otherwise to go into 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:32.340
 this part sure because it is an area 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:44.389
 which we did not explore then goodbye 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:47.939
 I felt beastly and own goodbye 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:50.099
 I just can't do it anymore I can't 

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:52.830
 more to continue this game 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:54.330
 mammamia to shit under the race nothing 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.490
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.379
 in this case we arrive in life we ​​leave a 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.210
 nice i like it and maybe why not 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:02.129
 continue it because it really is a stuff 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.839
 absurd so I 'm from the hd genre 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:05.839
