probably<00:00:20.510> blackbird<00:00:21.970> because<00:00:22.970> I<00:00:24.189> think<00:00:25.189> it

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
probably blackbird because I think it

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.640 
probably blackbird because I think it
means<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.970> lot<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.300> us<00:00:26.330> means<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.869> lot<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:27.560> the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
means a lot to us means a lot to the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.970 
means a lot to us means a lot to the
fans<00:00:28.420> we<00:00:29.420> enjoy<00:00:29.750> playing<00:00:30.050> it<00:00:30.200> but<00:00:30.259> it's<00:00:30.410> also<00:00:30.560> I

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
fans we enjoy playing it but it's also I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.140 
fans we enjoy playing it but it's also I
think<00:00:31.220> it's<00:00:31.550> there's<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:31.759> certain<00:00:31.970> amount<00:00:32.059> of

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
think it's there's a certain amount of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.750 
think it's there's a certain amount of
responsibility<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:33.350> not<00:00:33.530> just<00:00:34.250> phone<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.610> in

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
responsibility to not just phone it in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.180 
responsibility to not just phone it in
you've<00:00:35.120> got<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.360> go<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.629> place<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.199> it<00:00:37.010> can

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
you've got to go to that place so it can

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.950 
you've got to go to that place so it can
be<00:00:37.309> a<00:00:37.550> challenge<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:38.420> by<00:00:39.230> rewarding<00:00:43.960> probably

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
be a challenge but by rewarding probably

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.890 
be a challenge but by rewarding probably
when<00:00:45.080> we<00:00:45.110> were<00:00:45.410> working<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:46.600> private<00:00:47.600> kilise

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
when we were working on private kilise

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.349 
when we were working on private kilise

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
those two songs came together kind of as

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:53.649 
those two songs came together kind of as
we<00:00:52.489> were<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.179> studio<00:00:53.390> at

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
we were going in the studio at

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.060 
we were going in the studio at
pre-production<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:56.140> can<00:00:57.140> fortress<00:00:57.649> it<00:00:57.949> was

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
pre-production so I can fortress it was

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.680 
pre-production so I can fortress it was
hard<00:00:58.249> to<00:00:58.309> land<00:00:58.519> on<00:00:58.699> our<00:00:58.729> feet<00:00:58.850> after<00:00:59.329> we<00:00:59.390> really

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
hard to land on our feet after we really

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.630 
hard to land on our feet after we really
kind<00:01:00.019> of<00:01:00.140> changed<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.589> time<00:01:00.859> signature<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
kind of changed the time signature and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.520 
kind of changed the time signature and
the<00:01:02.269> whole<00:01:02.359> vibe<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.780> song<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.229> to<00:01:03.320> get

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the whole vibe of the song and to get

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.800 
the whole vibe of the song and to get
back<00:01:03.769> into<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.699> meat<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.000> song<00:01:05.180> was<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> big

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
back into the meat of the song was a big

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.480 
back into the meat of the song was a big
challenge<00:01:06.200> when<00:01:06.380> we<00:01:06.500> land<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:06.950> our<00:01:07.009> feet<00:01:07.070> that

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
challenge when we land on our feet that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.010 
challenge when we land on our feet that
was<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.789> the<00:01:07.850> more<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.479> best<00:01:08.630> moments

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
was one of the more the best moments

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.660 
was one of the more the best moments
yeah<00:01:09.500> yeah<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:09.950> would<00:01:10.189> agree<00:01:10.310> with<00:01:10.460> that<00:01:10.520> I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
yeah yeah I would agree with that I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.639 
yeah yeah I would agree with that I
think<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.090> because<00:01:12.020> those<00:01:12.200> were<00:01:12.350> two<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.530> the

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
think that because those were two of the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.060 
think that because those were two of the
songs<00:01:12.830> we<00:01:13.100> took<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.789> felt<00:01:14.000> like<00:01:14.090> you're<00:01:14.299> taking

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
songs we took we felt like you're taking

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.160 
songs we took we felt like you're taking
more<00:01:16.070> chances<00:01:16.130> with<00:01:16.759> in<00:01:17.299> terms<00:01:17.899> of<00:01:18.110> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
more chances with in terms of the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.649 
more chances with in terms of the
arrangements<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.130> was<00:01:19.220> frustrating<00:01:19.700> but

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
arrangements so it was frustrating but

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.139 
arrangements so it was frustrating but
once<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:21.679> got<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:22.100> we're<00:01:22.640> like<00:01:22.819> you<00:01:22.970> know<00:01:23.000> it's

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
once we got it we're like you know it's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.789 
once we got it we're like you know it's
it<00:01:23.299> he's<00:01:23.450> very<00:01:23.630> fulfilling<00:01:24.080> that's<00:01:24.530> kinda

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
it he's very fulfilling that's kinda

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.830 
it he's very fulfilling that's kinda
that's<00:01:24.920> kind<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.220> what<00:01:25.340> happened<00:01:25.640> with

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
that's kind of what happened with

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.940 
that's kind of what happened with
Blackbird<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:27.020> mean<00:01:27.140> remember<00:01:27.259> Blackbird

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
Blackbird I mean remember Blackbird

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.520 
Blackbird I mean remember Blackbird
years<00:01:28.610> ago<00:01:28.940> we<00:01:29.600> chased<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.049> one<00:01:30.170> down<00:01:30.259> for<00:01:30.500> a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
years ago we chased that one down for a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.730 
years ago we chased that one down for a
long<00:01:30.709> time

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
long time

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.510 
long time
and<00:01:32.160> we<00:01:32.280> finally<00:01:32.730> felt<00:01:33.120> like<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.520> so

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and we finally felt like we got it so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
and we finally felt like we got it so
you<00:01:35.610> feel<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.360> reach<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.290> summit<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you feel like your reach the summit and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
you feel like your reach the summit and
if<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.000> did<00:01:39.120> just<00:01:39.210> kind<00:01:39.480> of<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.090> put

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
if we did just kind of you know put

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.600 
if we did just kind of you know put
whatever<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.050> look<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:44.280> far<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
whatever there look as far as the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.250 
whatever there look as far as the
arrangement<00:01:45.030> went<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.690> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> puts

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
arrangement went and just kind of puts

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.180 
arrangement went and just kind of puts
filler<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:48.030> wouldn't<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.630> been<00:01:49.190> it

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
filler in it wouldn't have been it

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.890 
filler in it wouldn't have been it
wouldn't<00:01:50.460> been<00:01:50.580> as<00:01:50.700> nearly<00:01:51.300> as<00:01:51.360> rewarding<00:01:51.510> I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
wouldn't been as nearly as rewarding I

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.780 
wouldn't been as nearly as rewarding I
think<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> end<00:01:54.890> I'll<00:01:55.890> rise<00:01:56.130> today<00:01:56.340> videos
