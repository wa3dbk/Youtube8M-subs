00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hi so in the second tutorial let me show

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.809 
hi so in the second tutorial let me show
you<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.810> can<00:00:04.200> create<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:05.160> new<00:00:05.580> project

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
you how you can create a new project

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.930 
you how you can create a new project
from<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:07.230> existing<00:00:07.710> blank<00:00:08.040> game<00:00:08.400> project

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
from the existing blank game project

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.249 
from the existing blank game project
that<00:00:09.750> comes<00:00:09.960> with<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:11.099> isogenic<00:00:11.849> Engine

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
that comes with the isogenic Engine

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.589 
that comes with the isogenic Engine
repository<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.370> already<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.120> cloned

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
repository so we already have a cloned

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.340 
repository so we already have a cloned
repo<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.460> did<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.850> tutorial<00:00:18.420> 1<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.289> I'm

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
repo as we did from tutorial 1 so I'm

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.019 
repo as we did from tutorial 1 so I'm
going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.619> into<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.859> folder<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.279> where<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
going to go into that folder now where I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.439 
going to go into that folder now where I
have<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.289> cloned<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.220> IG<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.300> may

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
have actually just cloned the IG you may

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.900 
have actually just cloned the IG you may
have<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> called<00:00:25.199> IG<00:00:25.710> underscore<00:00:26.400> prototype

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
have it called IG underscore prototype

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.320 
have it called IG underscore prototype
but<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.660> basically<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> same<00:00:28.410> thing

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
but it's it's basically the same thing

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
but it's it's basically the same thing
the<00:00:30.330> IgE<00:00:30.689> version<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.130> paid-for

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the IgE version is just the the paid-for

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
the IgE version is just the the paid-for
version<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:34.110> comes<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> few<00:00:34.680> extra

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
version which comes with a few extra

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.180 
version which comes with a few extra
features<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.790> anyway<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
features but anyway so we're going to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
features but anyway so we're going to
that<00:00:38.370> folder<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.850> you'll<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> blank

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that folder and you'll see a blank

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.010 
that folder and you'll see a blank
underscore<00:00:41.040> game<00:00:41.450> folder<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
underscore game folder right here and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
underscore game folder right here and
we're<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
we're going to do is this this is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.779 
we're going to do is this this is
designed<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.059> copied<00:00:45.390> outside<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> IgE

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
designed to be copied outside of the IgE

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.240 
designed to be copied outside of the IgE
folder<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.200> reason<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> don't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
folder the reason for that is I don't

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.619 
folder the reason for that is I don't
know<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.430> anyone<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.789> familiar<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.239> git<00:00:51.449> if

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
know if anyone is familiar with git if

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
know if anyone is familiar with git if
they're<00:00:51.780> watching<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.980> should<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> as<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
they're watching this you should be as a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
they're watching this you should be as a
developer<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.110> haven't<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.770> know

just<00:01:31.950> right-click<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.729> copy<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
just right-click and copy that

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.410 
just right-click and copy that
kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> folder<00:01:36.390> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
kind of go back out to the folder that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.109 
kind of go back out to the folder that
IG<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> paste<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.000> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
IG is in and I'm going to paste that in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.319 
IG is in and I'm going to paste that in
here<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.040> now<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> blank<00:01:41.640> game<00:01:41.880> folder

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here so now we have a blank game folder

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.940 
here so now we have a blank game folder
and<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.049> rename<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:45.350> toriel<00:01:46.350> 2

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and I'm going to rename this to toriel 2

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.819 
and I'm going to rename this to toriel 2
because<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.670> where<00:01:47.909> we're<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.829> I'm

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
because that's where we're at now I'm

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
because that's where we're at now I'm
going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.280> folder<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
going to go into that folder and it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
going to go into that folder and it
comes<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> number<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.320> files<00:01:53.100> already<00:01:53.520> in

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
examples you have to get that web server

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.449 
examples you have to get that web server
up<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.629> running<00:03:15.750> first<00:03:16.169> and<00:03:16.469> there<00:03:17.370> are

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
up and running first and there are

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.009 
up and running first and there are
various<00:03:17.699> tutorials<00:03:17.909> online<00:03:18.359> how<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.720> do<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
various tutorials online how to do that

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.569 
various tutorials online how to do that
so<00:03:19.199> I'm<00:03:19.290> not<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.620> cover<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.280> mind

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
so I'm not going to cover that in mind

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.719 
so I'm not going to cover that in mind
here<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.290> how<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.709> set<00:03:23.010> up<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.459> new

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:23.729 
here so this is how you set up a new

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.330 
here so this is how you set up a new
project<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.659> got<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.959> basic<00:03:25.379> set

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
project so you just got your basic set

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.619 
project so you just got your basic set
up<00:03:26.459> you'll<00:03:26.639> notice<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.209> frames<00:03:27.540> per

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
up you'll notice that the frames per

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.210 
up you'll notice that the frames per
second<00:03:27.959> isn't<00:03:28.139> especially<00:03:28.500> fast<00:03:28.979> that's

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
second isn't especially fast that's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.250 
second isn't especially fast that's
because<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.810> recording<00:03:30.810> software<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.229> have

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
because of the recording software I have

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.670 
because of the recording software I have
running<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.510> don't<00:03:34.079> don't<00:03:34.290> pay<00:03:34.530> any<00:03:34.650> attention

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
running so don't don't pay any attention

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.740 
running so don't don't pay any attention
to<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.189> at<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.459> moment<00:03:35.639> I'm<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.449> open

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
to that at the moment I'm going to open

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.809 
to that at the moment I'm going to open
the<00:03:37.109> browser<00:03:37.530> console<00:03:38.099> quickly<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.699> can

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
the browser console quickly so you can

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.300 
the browser console quickly so you can
kind<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.060> see<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.629> happens<00:03:39.959> when<00:03:40.139> a<00:03:40.349> blank

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
kind of see what happens when a blank

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280 
kind of see what happens when a blank
game<00:03:41.459> loads<00:03:41.699> so<00:03:42.419> I'm<00:03:42.599> holding<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.900> ctrl

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
game loads so I'm holding that ctrl

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.099 
game loads so I'm holding that ctrl
shift<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.889> I'm<00:03:44.370> going<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.579> tap<00:03:44.790> J<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.509> chrome

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
shift and I'm going to tap J in chrome

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.210 
shift and I'm going to tap J in chrome
that<00:03:46.139> opens<00:03:46.620> up<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.040> JavaScript<00:03:48.019> console<00:03:49.220> so

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
you what what the engines been doing if

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.909

getting Mouse events as well that's
that's<00:04:04.109> part<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.620> gland<00:04:04.979> games<00:04:05.220> just

that's part of the gland games just

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.199 
that's part of the gland games just
built<00:04:05.669> in<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.959> that's<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.400> basics<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.970> setting

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
built in so that's the basics of setting

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
up a new project now I don't know if any

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.249 
up a new project now I don't know if any
of<00:04:13.229> you<00:04:13.349> use<00:04:13.620> PHP<00:04:14.489> storm<00:04:14.939> or<00:04:15.150> web<00:04:15.329> storm<00:04:15.599> by

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.649 
of you use PHP storm or web storm by
jetbrains<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.009> this<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.310> by<00:04:17.579> far<00:04:17.659> probably

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
jetbrains but this is by far probably

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:22.730 
jetbrains but this is by far probably
the<00:04:19.229> best<00:04:19.519> IDE<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.060> get<00:04:21.239> for<00:04:21.740> client-side

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
the best IDE you can get for client-side

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.120 
the best IDE you can get for client-side
and<00:04:23.099> server-side<00:04:23.159> development<00:04:24.090> on<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> web

and server-side development on the web

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.530 
and server-side development on the web
you<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.279> have<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.639> pay<00:04:26.789> for<00:04:26.820> it

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
you do have to pay for it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.200 
you do have to pay for it
but<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:27.900> very<00:04:28.380> very<00:04:28.650> much<00:04:28.860> well<00:04:29.640> worth<00:04:29.850> money

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
but it's very very much well worth money

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.080 
but it's very very much well worth money
it<00:04:30.900> really<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.260> absolutely<00:04:31.560> fantastic<00:04:32.160> of

off<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.270> stats<00:05:45.510> quite<00:05:45.810> useful<00:05:46.170> for

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
off the stats quite useful for

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.630 
off the stats quite useful for
development<00:05:46.890> so<00:05:47.070> we're<00:05:47.280> just<00:05:47.310> going<00:05:47.580> to

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
development so we're just going to

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.510 
development so we're just going to
switch<00:05:47.820> that<00:05:47.970> back<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.330> for<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.840> time<00:05:49.020> being

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.000 
you can also just comment that out
instead<00:05:51.930> which<00:05:52.260> is<00:05:52.440> effectively<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.980> same

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
instead which is effectively the same

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.500 
instead which is effectively the same
thing<00:05:53.190> as<00:05:53.490> switching<00:05:53.790> it<00:05:53.880> off<00:05:56.360> we<00:05:57.360> also

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
thing as switching it off we also

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.300 
thing as switching it off we also
switched<00:05:57.690> in<00:05:57.960> debugging<00:05:58.380> settings<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:59.070> true

switched in debugging settings to true

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.310 
switched in debugging settings to true
here<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.730> can<00:05:59.910> switch<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.270> to<00:06:00.420> false<00:06:00.630> if

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
here you can switch that to false if

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.780 
here you can switch that to false if
you'd<00:06:01.500> like<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.800> have<00:06:01.980> all<00:06:02.340> your<00:06:02.550> double

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
you'd like to have all your double

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.470 
you'd like to have all your double
debugging<00:06:03.180> switched<00:06:03.420> off<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:04.620> if<00:06:04.710> we<00:06:04.740> do<00:06:04.950> that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
debugging switched off and if we do that

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.360 
debugging switched off and if we do that
and<00:06:06.480> reload<00:06:06.840> notice<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:07.710> output<00:06:08.100> you're

and reload notice the output you're
getting<00:06:08.670> here<00:06:09.020> if<00:06:10.020> we<00:06:10.170> just<00:06:10.320> reload<00:06:10.500> the<00:06:10.650> page

you won't get any clicks if you look at

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.040 
you won't get any clicks if you look at

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
debugging switch is off as well but

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.190 
debugging switch is off as well but
we're<00:06:21.330> going<00:06:21.540> to<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:21.750> in<00:06:21.870> this<00:06:22.020> tutorial

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
we're going to that in this tutorial

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.090 
we're going to that in this tutorial
either<00:06:22.670> so<00:06:23.670> let's<00:06:23.760> just<00:06:23.880> keep<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.390> true

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
either so let's just keep that to true

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.380 
either so let's just keep that to true
you'll<00:06:26.100> see<00:06:26.280> a<00:06:26.310> couple<00:06:26.700> of<00:06:26.760> game<00:06:26.940> textures

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
you'll see a couple of game textures

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.940 
you'll see a couple of game textures
getting<00:06:27.750> loaded<00:06:27.960> here<00:06:28.230> textures<00:06:28.680> are<00:06:28.800> just

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
getting loaded here textures are just

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.320 
getting loaded here textures are just
images<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.870> it's<00:06:30.870> just<00:06:31.140> a<00:06:31.260> fancy<00:06:31.710> word<00:06:31.830> for

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
images and it's just a fancy word for

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.640 
images and it's just a fancy word for
images<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.450> want<00:06:33.600> to<00:06:33.720> have<00:06:33.870> shown<00:06:34.290> on<00:06:34.500> screen

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
images you want to have shown on screen

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.709 
images you want to have shown on screen
and<00:06:36.440> we're<00:06:37.440> loading<00:06:37.680> a<00:06:37.980> ferry<00:06:38.250> image<00:06:38.669> which<00:06:39.630> is

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
and we're loading a ferry image which is

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:46.079 
and we're loading a ferry image which is
that<00:06:41.849> little<00:06:42.849> dude<00:06:43.119> there<00:06:43.449> and<00:06:44.729> then<00:06:45.729> a<00:06:45.759> simple

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:46.089 
that little dude there and then a simple

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:48.179 
that little dude there and then a simple
box<00:06:46.449> and<00:06:46.749> simple<00:06:47.019> box<00:06:47.199> is<00:06:47.559> actually<00:06:48.159> a

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
box and simple box is actually a

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.559 
box and simple box is actually a
JavaScript<00:06:48.759> file<00:06:48.969> it's<00:06:49.209> what<00:06:49.329> we<00:06:49.389> call<00:06:49.509> a

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:49.569 
JavaScript file it's what we call a

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.100 
JavaScript file it's what we call a
smart<00:06:49.869> texture<00:06:50.759> and<00:06:51.759> that's<00:06:52.149> a<00:06:52.449> sort<00:06:52.869> of<00:06:52.899> a

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
smart texture and that's a sort of a

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.769 
smart texture and that's a sort of a
just<00:06:53.769> a<00:06:54.159> load<00:06:54.279> of<00:06:54.309> them<00:06:54.579> JavaScript<00:06:55.569> calls

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:55.779 
just a load of them JavaScript calls

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:58.559 
just a load of them JavaScript calls
that<00:06:56.079> interface<00:06:56.679> directly<00:06:56.860> with<00:06:57.159> canvas<00:06:57.699> and

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
that interface directly with canvas and

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.169 
that interface directly with canvas and
and<00:06:58.839> use<00:06:58.989> the<00:06:59.139> canvas<00:06:59.349> draw<00:06:59.939> functionality<00:07:00.939> to

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:01.179 
and use the canvas draw functionality to

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.600 
and use the canvas draw functionality to
draw<00:07:01.869> lines<00:07:02.079> and<00:07:02.469> fills<00:07:02.979> and<00:07:03.189> whatever<00:07:03.309> and

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
draw lines and fills and whatever and

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.789 
draw lines and fills and whatever and
you<00:07:04.239> can<00:07:04.269> turn<00:07:04.539> those<00:07:04.629> into<00:07:04.839> textures<00:07:05.499> as<00:07:05.619> well

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:05.799 
you can turn those into textures as well

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:08.659 
you can turn those into textures as well
so<00:07:06.009> you<00:07:06.069> can<00:07:06.279> have<00:07:06.699> those<00:07:06.789> drawn<00:07:07.089> on<00:07:07.239> screen

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
so you can have those drawn on screen

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:11.429 
so you can have those drawn on screen
then<00:07:09.669> we<00:07:09.849> we<00:07:10.389> wait<00:07:10.539> for<00:07:10.689> the<00:07:10.809> textures<00:07:11.199> to<00:07:11.319> be

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:11.439 
then we we wait for the textures to be

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.439 
then we we wait for the textures to be
loaded<00:07:11.799> we<00:07:12.429> create<00:07:12.669> a<00:07:12.699> front<00:07:12.939> buffer<00:07:13.119> which<00:07:13.419> is

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449 
loaded we create a front buffer which is

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.949 
loaded we create a front buffer which is
actually<00:07:13.989> just<00:07:14.079> the<00:07:14.289> canvas<00:07:14.949> element<00:07:15.959> after

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:16.959 
actually just the canvas element after

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:19.439 
actually just the canvas element after
that<00:07:17.499> we<00:07:17.709> ask<00:07:18.009> the<00:07:18.189> engine<00:07:18.489> to<00:07:18.579> start<00:07:18.879> and<00:07:19.149> we

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
that we ask the engine to start and we

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.540 
that we ask the engine to start and we
register<00:07:19.839> a<00:07:19.959> callback<00:07:20.229> method<00:07:21.069> which<00:07:21.279> is<00:07:21.429> this

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
register a callback method which is this

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.850 
register a callback method which is this
thing<00:07:21.610> here<00:07:22.199> so<00:07:23.199> once<00:07:23.379> the<00:07:23.499> engine<00:07:23.709> has

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
thing here so once the engine has

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.519 
thing here so once the engine has
started<00:07:24.249> up<00:07:24.399> we<00:07:24.789> can<00:07:24.939> proceed<00:07:25.239> with<00:07:25.529> creating

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:26.529 
started up we can proceed with creating

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:30.299 
started up we can proceed with creating
our<00:07:27.309> scene<00:07:27.669> object<00:07:28.409> then<00:07:29.409> our<00:07:29.529> viewport<00:07:30.069> and

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:30.309 
our scene object then our viewport and

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:34.379 
our scene object then our viewport and
then<00:07:30.369> a<00:07:31.059> couple<00:07:31.329> of<00:07:31.539> a<00:07:32.110> few<00:07:32.499> rotating<00:07:33.389> method

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:34.389 
then a couple of a few rotating method

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.290 
then a couple of a few rotating method
through<00:07:34.809> rotating<00:07:35.229> entities<00:07:35.999> and<00:07:36.999> these<00:07:37.149> are

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
through rotating entities and these are

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.839 
through rotating entities and these are
rotator<00:07:37.749> classes<00:07:38.499> and<00:07:39.279> as<00:07:39.399> you<00:07:39.519> can<00:07:39.610> see<00:07:39.669> in

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:39.849 
rotator classes and as you can see in

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:41.429 
rotator classes and as you can see in
the<00:07:39.939> comment<00:07:40.269> it's<00:07:40.809> declared<00:07:41.079> in<00:07:41.259> game
