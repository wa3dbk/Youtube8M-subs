00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.009
 so let's go to the next part that we're 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.679
 talking about what stands that stands 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.160
 is the number three in which they are if 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.900
 we are talking about what kind of 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.380
 materials are available and which ones 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 types of materials are those that we 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.990
 basically 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.230
 It is convenient for us to have to exhibit our 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.350
 cake there are for example we start there are 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.480
 which stands that are plastic and also 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.880
 We have exhibitors that are metal 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.699
 clear that the metal is a little bit more 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.649
 expensive but it's also a very good idea if 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.469
 you are going to start your pastry or 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.780
 wants to work for a bakery or 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.149
 he wants the cakes to come more 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.249
 pretty then you need more than anything 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.710
 these exhibitors if we go to the party 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.260
 number 4 that we also have it in 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.010
 our in our role we are 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.350
 talking about the spatulas now at 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.749
 spatulas are very good to cover the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.630
 Chantilly cake and also work 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:06.500
 in the parts in the next parts 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.360
 if we go to part number 5 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.550
 we started talking about the pipes 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 the parking English are called here not 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.630
 I know how they call him in Spanish but in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 English call him English more than anything 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 are the pipes to make different 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.620
 types of decoration types and there 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 would be that we can we can write 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.280
 have letters is usually the number 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.680
 three and it 's a little hole that has 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.460
 the tip we also have to make 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 stars there is that it is usually 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.410
 different than the others then right now 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'm going to show you the differences that 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.310
 exist here here we can look at them 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.650
 it also serves as here we have the tip 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 and we have stars to do this kind 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.570
 of different design we also have this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.570
 design to make this different the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.060
 tips are different and they give us 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.400
 different effects this tip is for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.880
 make the roses and this tip is for 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.920
 do the leaves then more than anything 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.590
 it's a matter of practice and it's a matter of knowing 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 which of this tip gives you the effect that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.829
 you are looking good 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.829

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.590
 about the bags to the bags for 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.160
 plastic well nylon air and also from 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.830

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.140
 tools already well placed then already 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.180
 You can look for one of more good quality 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.390
