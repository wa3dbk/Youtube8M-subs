 take a seat so we can start 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.939
 I'm the only one 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.629

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.629
 back 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.930
 is part of the imperial delegation not 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.230
 can decide who called the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.970
 advice 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.500
 while I'm walking him if we have to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
 negotiate the terms of the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.060
 negotiations we will not reach any 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 part 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.710
 maybe it's a good time to listen 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.829
 what he has to say 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.420
 with respect to this case it is not that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.420
 We were going to go hostile and you'll see 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 to the present 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.260

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.260
 my mother how much riff-raff this is more 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 uncomfortable that when the man then went 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.320
 to ask for a book from the library 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 good 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.180
 good morning, I came to ask for a book 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 please do not attack me attack 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:28.920
 the one who just wants a book wanted the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 last book of twilight 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.750
 I came for that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 of damn attacks 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.570
 dammit 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.030
 Do not run or run, we must continue in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.030
 before I have something to say 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.810
 how heavy are you 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.920
 there's nothing else to talk about unless 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.840
 is not finally willing to give up 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.940
 his unfair claim of government and I 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 but we have come to complete the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.750
 terms of a temporary truce so that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.240
 Saturday of cold can fall is more 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.420

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.880
 more brand as 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 I tried to escape 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.230
