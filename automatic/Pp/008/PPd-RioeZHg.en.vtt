for a halo reach port into the game but
let's<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.909> honest<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.330> porting<00:01:27.810> reach<00:01:28.049> into

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
let's be honest here porting reach into

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
let's be honest here porting reach into
the<00:01:28.619> game<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.040> much<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.729> difficult<00:01:29.970> than

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the game is much more difficult than

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
the game is much more difficult than
porting<00:01:30.720> Halo<00:01:30.990> 3<00:01:31.020> ODST<00:01:31.290> there's<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.280> work

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
porting Halo 3 ODST there's more work

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
porting Halo 3 ODST there's more work
involved<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.750> mean<00:01:33.960> we're<00:01:34.320> getting<00:01:34.590> all

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
involved and I mean we're getting all

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.530 
involved and I mean we're getting all
this<00:01:34.829> stuff<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.340> free<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this stuff for free so there really is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
this stuff for free so there really is
no<00:01:36.810> reason<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> complain<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.490> think

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
no reason to complain about it I think

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
no reason to complain about it I think
we<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.150> also<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.780> optimistic<00:01:39.990> about

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
we can also be very optimistic about

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.289 
we can also be very optimistic about
this<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.310> fact<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:42.000> able

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this because the fact that they are able

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.139 
this because the fact that they are able
to<00:01:42.659> port<00:01:43.079> Halo<00:01:43.500> 3<00:01:43.530> ODST<00:01:43.799> into<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> master

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to port Halo 3 ODST into the master

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.340 
to port Halo 3 ODST into the master
chief<00:01:45.329> collection<00:01:45.360> means<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
chief collection means there is a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
chief collection means there is a
possibility<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.340> eventually<00:01:47.970> maybe<00:01:48.210> just

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
possibility that eventually maybe just

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.719 
possibility that eventually maybe just
one<00:01:48.899> day<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.740> halo<00:01:50.009> reach<00:01:50.280> make<00:01:50.549> its

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
one day we will see halo reach make its
