I<00:00:44.879> had<00:00:45.719> made<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.379> circuit<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.160> 24<00:00:47.969> volts<00:00:48.360> but

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I had made a circuit for 24 volts but

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.270 
I had made a circuit for 24 volts but
now<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.620> testing<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.520> an<00:00:50.670> car<00:00:51.420> battery

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
from say 12 point for up to 15 volts so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.619 
from say 12 point for up to 15 volts so
I'm<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> test<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.670> how<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.940> meter<00:01:03.239> how

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I'm going to test now how this meter how

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.700 
I'm going to test now how this meter how

the pointer moves when I change the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.240 
the pointer moves when I change the

for<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.750> car<00:01:16.020> battery<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:18.320> now<00:01:19.320> I'm<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.860> to

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
for a car battery and now I'm going to

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.999 
for a car battery and now I'm going to
certain<00:01:23.009> 0.2<00:01:23.610> volts<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.299> hope<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.470> pointer<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

point<00:01:33.090> eight<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
point eight so you see that there is a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.539 
point eight so you see that there is a
quite<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> long<00:01:39.030> scale<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.130> same

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
quite a long scale and that's the same

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.300 
quite a long scale and that's the same
from<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> circuit<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.350> has<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> kind<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
from this circuit it has a kind of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.410 
from this circuit it has a kind of
extended<00:01:45.090> scale<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.130> measures<00:01:47.340> only<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
extended scale so it measures only in a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.830 
extended scale so it measures only in a
limited<00:01:48.780> range<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> use<00:01:51.540> such<00:01:51.810> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
limited range and when you use such a

limited range and when you use such a
circuit<00:01:52.409> sorry<00:01:53.100> such<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.659> macro<00:01:54.659> parameter<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
circuit sorry such a macro parameter in

circuit sorry such a macro parameter in
a<00:01:56.100> normal<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.030> will<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.290> instance

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
a normal way you will see for instance

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.389 
a normal way you will see for instance
that<00:01:59.060> 12<00:02:00.060> volt<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.399> fourteen

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that 12 volt is here and fourteen

that 12 volt is here and fourteen
folders<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> case

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
folders here but that's not the case

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
folders here but that's not the case
when<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> use<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.640> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:09.619> current

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
when you use this kind of current

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.940 
when you use this kind of current
amplifier<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.629> think<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.020> call<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.379> this<00:02:13.500> way

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
amplifier I think I can call it this way

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
amplifier I think I can call it this way
but<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.000> exactly<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
but I don't know that exactly but I

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.550 
but I don't know that exactly but I
think<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> useful<00:02:20.340> circuit<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.410> testing<00:02:22.410> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
think is a useful circuit and testing it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.740 
think is a useful circuit and testing it
now<00:02:22.769> with<00:02:24.950> potentiometers<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.750> when

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
now with potentiometers here and when

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.100 
now with potentiometers here and when
all<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.930> aligned<00:02:28.530> well<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> replace

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
all is aligned well I'm going to replace

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.650 
all is aligned well I'm going to replace
this<00:02:31.110> potentiometer<00:02:31.680> by<00:02:32.310> two<00:02:32.910> fixed<00:02:33.330> value

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
this potentiometer by two fixed value

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.589 
this potentiometer by two fixed value
resistors<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.610> Here<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> am<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.330> do<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
resistors and Here I am going to do the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.190 
resistors and Here I am going to do the
same<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> develop<00:02:39.870> such<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
same so that's the way to develop such a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.740 
same so that's the way to develop such a
circuit<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.280> develop<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:42.360> circuit

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
circuit and you can develop this circuit

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.220 
circuit and you can develop this circuit
for<00:02:42.930> all<00:02:43.110> kinds<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.530> voltages<00:02:44.480> say<00:02:45.480> six<00:02:45.930> volt
