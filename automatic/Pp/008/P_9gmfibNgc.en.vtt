00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.030 
occurs wonder what people in the future
would<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> was

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
would think what that was

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.139 
would think what that was
the<00:02:02.040> paintings<00:02:02.520> almost<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> time<00:02:03.119> machine

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the paintings almost like a time machine

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.200 
the paintings almost like a time machine
in<00:02:03.540> itself<00:02:03.899> maybe<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.369> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
in itself maybe one of the things that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.020 
in itself maybe one of the things that
we<00:02:06.659> try<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.200> when<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:07.799> making<00:02:07.920> images<00:02:08.489> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
we try to do when we're making images is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
we try to do when we're making images is
to<00:02:09.390> preserve<00:02:09.929> we're<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.500> capturing

things I hope that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.699 
things I hope that
for<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.500> long<00:02:14.459> period<00:02:14.519> of<00:02:14.909> time<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.239> making

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
for that long period of time of making

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.240 
for that long period of time of making
that<00:02:16.879> some<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:19.049> concentration<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.010> some

that some of that concentration and some
of<00:02:20.370> those<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.939> time<00:02:21.720> spent<00:02:22.370> get<00:02:23.370> soaked<00:02:23.909> up

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
of those that time spent get soaked up
