00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.030
 Y 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.140
 very good everyone here you robot android 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.540
 have a new video today we are going to 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.910
 learn how to make a nesquik boat 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.189
 decorated very well this is simply going to 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.230
 be to reuse it this video I do 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.250
 because I had it at home and I did not know what 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.500
 do with him 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.779
 or is that good materials we will 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.110
 use is going to be a little bit of paper 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.180
 wrapping gifts also items 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.070
 decorative in this case I will use 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.050
 lyrics you can do yourself 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.600
 I say I need and scissors and a punctual 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.240
 if you do not have you can use the one of a 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.190
 compass I do not know how good we are going to move to 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.560
 the construction well the first thing that 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.040
 we will do will be to completely return the 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.300
 paper the pot with paper well not yet what 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.560
 we are going to paste the simply what 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.140
 we will fix 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.230
 and clear 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.329
 set this part the straight part the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.300
 we will put up here and then with 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 our punch will be marking the other 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.420
 part 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.770
 good marking the will continue to break 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.770
 the producers delicated 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.780
 here it will take 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.130
 so for all the paper it's worth I'm going to 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.110
 do and now I'll be back 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.980
 when the head has to stay something 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.930
 thus they remained 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.890
 and now the next thing we will do is 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.800
 take glue I have it here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.900
 bar because it is the best will 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.610
 get the paper 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.500
 and the only thing that we will have to do 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.560
 it's going to be putting glue like that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.079
 OK 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.899
 and we have any little if you prefer 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.450
 You can start with this part although not 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.450
 you put it as an example nothing 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.550
 and we will apply will be to place this part 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.690
 here come the two parts like this 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.690
 with which I'm not seeing 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.680
 twenty 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.120
 that being quite focused on 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.670
 our city and it will go wrong 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.280
 and the bottom part the bottom part 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.879
 it will simply be to put the one above 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.590
 down well also so I'm going to go 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.980
 doing and now I will show you how 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.980
 those 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 ah 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 ah 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.260
 well as you see this is no longer 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.740
 leaving pretty well is this part that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.740
 justly 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.950
 I had not thought it would come 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.829
 you see this has already changed a bit 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.680
 way and what we could do now is 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.230
 place letters and in this case form 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.920
 the word robot because my channel this 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.209
 Android robot and then I do not know about you 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.209
 you can write your names 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.470
 for example in coffee the word coffee and 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.299
 inside you keep coffee like that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.569
 well I 'm sticking it and now we'll go 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.569
 seeing 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.740
 well as you see this has already taken its 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.400
 way and the only thing that we would have left 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:03.400
 seriously inside everything I would like 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 it is ours would be where they removed 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.489
 it's quite simple but good the idea is 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.830
 have to see what you have at home 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.319
 reuse it is worth it to be a simple 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.000
 drogba the important thing is that we have 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.859
 reused something and this can serve 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.780
 like a piggy bank to store the colors 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.660
 for example this is called is for some 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.210
 children because for example they have the mouse 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.040
 mickey mouse and I do not know everything is oriented 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.110
 well more for children because this paper 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.720
 I do not even know how many years it takes me 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.389
 house but good what is important is that what 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.120
 that we reuse something we had and so 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.880
 get us something that is cool and also 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.980
 Another use that you can give is links a 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.200
 hole to the top floor what 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.170
 you are putting coins and so for example 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.900
 in the future now if you buy something something 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.730
 that you like and good today's video has 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.110
 been very simple but you know what 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.240
 important is to reuse that is if you 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.080
 he liked to give you like favorites and 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.270
 comment 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.270
 I mean good come on until later 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.060
 hot
