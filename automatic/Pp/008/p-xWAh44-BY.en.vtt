00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.670 

I<00:00:00.800> see<00:00:01.800> really<00:00:02.010> mixed<00:00:02.550> messages<00:00:03.589> being<00:00:04.589> sent

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
I see really mixed messages being sent

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.619 
I see really mixed messages being sent
by<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.100> school<00:00:05.339> reform<00:00:05.730> movement<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.420> teacher

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
by the school reform movement to teacher

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.810 
by the school reform movement to teacher
so<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.170> one<00:00:07.319> hand<00:00:07.379> we're<00:00:08.370> saying<00:00:08.639> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
so on the one hand we're saying to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.879 
so on the one hand we're saying to
teachers<00:00:09.179> teachers<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.170> great<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.650> love

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
teachers teachers are great we love

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
teachers teachers are great we love
teachers<00:00:11.250> they're<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.820> important<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
teachers they're so important and on the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.039 
teachers they're so important and on the
other<00:00:13.679> hand<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.460> saying<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.880> teachers<00:00:15.299> we

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
other hand we're saying to teachers we

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.150 
other hand we're saying to teachers we
wouldn't<00:00:16.350> trust<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.770> our<00:00:16.800> neighbor's

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
wouldn't trust you with our neighbor's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.029 
wouldn't trust you with our neighbor's
dog<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:19.050> gonna<00:00:19.109> micromanage<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
dog and so we're gonna micromanage you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.630 
dog and so we're gonna micromanage you
essentially<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.359> think<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
essentially and I think that the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.980 
essentially and I think that the
consequences<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> those<00:00:23.850> mixed<00:00:24.240> messages<00:00:24.810> are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
consequences of those mixed messages are

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.439 
consequences of those mixed messages are
pretty<00:00:25.199> tragic<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.180> hand

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
pretty tragic so you know the one hand

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
pretty tragic so you know the one hand
we've<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.869> teachers<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.920> important<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we've got teachers are so important and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.690 
we've got teachers are so important and
what<00:00:30.300> happens<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.500> teachers<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.430> held

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
what happens is that teachers get held

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.100 
what happens is that teachers get held
responsible<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.540> things<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.899> can't

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
responsible for things they can't

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.400 
responsible for things they can't
possibly<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:35.219> held<00:00:35.430> responsible<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.410> like

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
possibly be held responsible for like

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.030 
possibly be held responsible for like
the<00:00:37.649> effects<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.070> poverty<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.950> think<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the effects of poverty I think it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
the effects of poverty I think it
actually<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.640> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.940> cruel<00:00:42.270> joke<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
actually it's a kind of cruel joke so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
actually it's a kind of cruel joke so
what<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.340> country<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
what we really have in this country is a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
what we really have in this country is a
poverty<00:00:45.210> gap<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.750> someone<00:00:46.649> along<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> way

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
poverty gap and someone along the way

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.910 
poverty gap and someone along the way
renamed<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.989> achievement<00:00:49.260> gap<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
renamed it as an achievement gap and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.540 
renamed it as an achievement gap and
held<00:00:50.190> teachers<00:00:51.120> accountable<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.550> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
held teachers accountable for it and so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
held teachers accountable for it and so
on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.270> hand<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> teachers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
on the one hand we think that teachers

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
on the one hand we think that teachers
can<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
can do more than they can do which is to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
can do more than they can do which is to
close<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> poverty<00:00:59.100> gap<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> other

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
close the poverty gap and on the other

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
close the poverty gap and on the other
hand<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.960> don't<00:01:01.109> allow<00:01:01.469> them<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.859> as

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
hand we don't allow them to be as

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
hand we don't allow them to be as
effective<00:01:02.280> as<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.879> could<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.840> we

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
effective as they could be because we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
effective as they could be because we
undermine<00:01:04.500> their<00:01:04.860> professional<00:01:05.400> judgment<00:01:05.430> on

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
undermine their professional judgment on

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
undermine their professional judgment on
every<00:01:06.960> possible<00:01:07.229> level<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.439> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
every possible level and you know I

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.649 
every possible level and you know I
think<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.189> pretty<00:01:11.400> simple<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:11.939> in

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
think that it's pretty simple because in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
think that it's pretty simple because in
a<00:01:13.080> thriving<00:01:13.409> democracy<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.640> need<00:01:14.909> are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
a thriving democracy what you need are

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.170 
a thriving democracy what you need are
empowered<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> engaged<00:01:16.290> citizens<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
empowered and engaged citizens and I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
empowered and engaged citizens and I
don't<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> schools<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.409> possibly

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
don't think that schools can possibly

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
don't think that schools can possibly
help<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.549> shape<00:01:20.759> empower<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> engage<00:01:21.570> citizens

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
help to shape empower to engage citizens

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
help to shape empower to engage citizens
when<00:01:22.710> teachers<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.490> people<00:01:24.090> who<00:01:24.330> spend

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
when teachers the very people who spend

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.760 
when teachers the very people who spend
the<00:01:24.630> most<00:01:24.659> time<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.080> our<00:01:25.170> children<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the most time with our children are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
the most time with our children are
disempowered<00:01:26.369> themselves<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:33.119> know

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
disempowered themselves and so you know

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.170 
disempowered themselves and so you know
the<00:01:34.079> effect<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.700> punitive

the effect of the this this punitive
school<00:01:36.600> reform<00:01:37.020> movement<00:01:37.130> has<00:01:38.130> been<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> strip

teachers have to continue their graduate

teachers have to continue their graduate
education<00:01:57.570> while<00:01:58.170> they're<00:01:58.350> teaching<00:01:58.560> many

can't actually do the things that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.319 
can't actually do the things that
they're<00:02:05.430> learning<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.969> graduate

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
they're learning in this graduate

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
they're learning in this graduate
education<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:07.079> their<00:02:07.170> own<00:02:07.320> classrooms<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
education in their own classrooms and so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.309 
education in their own classrooms and so
I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.789> sometimes<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.390> effect<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> really

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I think sometimes the effect of a really

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.380 
I think sometimes the effect of a really
good<00:02:10.500> graduate<00:02:11.009> teacher<00:02:11.489> education<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.360> a

good graduate teacher education is a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.800 
good graduate teacher education is a
kind

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810

professional depression because you're

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
professional depression because you're

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
learning about this powerful pedagogy

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.520 
learning about this powerful pedagogy
and<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.450> allowed<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> use<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.500> your

standardized teaching that's in place

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.910 
standardized teaching that's in place

and so you know again thinking about

you<00:02:33.209> know<00:02:33.330> they've<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:33.569> those<00:02:33.930> scripted

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you know they've got those scripted

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.589 
you know they've got those scripted
computerized<00:02:35.010> menus<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.790> place<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.300> make<00:02:36.450> you

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
computerized menus in place to make you

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.089 
computerized menus in place to make you
think<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.989> they've<00:02:37.319> got<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.560> customer

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
think that they've got a customer

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.830 
think that they've got a customer
service<00:02:38.310> department<00:02:38.849> right<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.209> those

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
service department right and those

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.780 
service department right and those
scripted<00:02:40.319> menus<00:02:40.709> are<00:02:40.920> pretty<00:02:41.099> bad<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.459> finding

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
scripted menus are pretty bad at finding

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.820 
scripted menus are pretty bad at finding
your<00:02:41.880> lost<00:02:42.030> luggage<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:43.170> even<00:02:43.440> worse

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
your lost luggage and they're even worse

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.170 
your lost luggage and they're even worse
for<00:02:44.220> teaching<00:02:44.580> children<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.260> think<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:48.120> is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
for teaching children so I think this is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.210 
for teaching children so I think this is
a<00:02:48.330> problem<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.019> can't<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.350> solved<00:02:49.830> by<00:02:49.890> just

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
a problem that can't be solved by just

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.309 
a problem that can't be solved by just
fiddling<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.000> particulars<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
fiddling with the particulars of the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.199 
fiddling with the particulars of the
reform<00:02:52.709> movement<00:02:53.190> or<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.430> language<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
reform movement or the language of the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
reform movement or the language of the
standards<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.959> think<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.620> even<00:02:55.709> teenagers

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
standards I think that even teenagers

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.180 
standards I think that even teenagers
know<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.330> actually<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.769> Michigan

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
know this so I actually in Michigan

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
know this so I actually in Michigan
about<00:02:59.400> five<00:02:59.610> years<00:02:59.819> ago<00:03:00.180> they<00:03:00.750> created<00:03:01.260> these

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
about five years ago they created these

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.070 
about five years ago they created these
grade<00:03:01.799> level<00:03:02.160> content<00:03:02.340> expectations<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.510> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
grade level content expectations and I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.420 
grade level content expectations and I
think<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.410> were<00:03:04.470> trying<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.920> fiddle<00:03:05.130> with

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
think they were trying to fiddle with

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.949 
think they were trying to fiddle with
the<00:03:05.519> particulars<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.209> language<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.840> make

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the particulars of the language to make

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.780 
the particulars of the language to make
them<00:03:07.170> sound<00:03:07.380> less<00:03:07.709> authoritarian<00:03:08.280> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
them sound less authoritarian and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.449 
them sound less authoritarian and
intimidating<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.410> one<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.980> eighth<00:03:11.130> grade

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
intimidating so one of the eighth grade

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.490 
intimidating so one of the eighth grade
content<00:03:12.060> level<00:03:12.299> expectations<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.170> language

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
content level expectations for language

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.940 
content level expectations for language
arts<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.760> went<00:03:15.150> exactly<00:03:15.599> like<00:03:15.750> this

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950

students<00:03:16.950> will<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.280> enthusiastic<00:03:18.150> about

the<00:04:02.400> base<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.569> punitive<00:04:04.410> school<00:04:04.829> reform

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the base of this punitive school reform
