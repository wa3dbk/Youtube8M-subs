 then there is all the dialogue goes well and by 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 consequently we should bet all the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.190

 I will also do a mission guide 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 because this mission a little more 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.049
 demanding of the first I will need a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.820
 sniper meanwhile I tell you if you have the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.439
 silencer still average however also 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 I'm a sniper 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.009
 ok here I suggest you to take it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.540
 even the car fast enough 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.400
 because there will be no time to do everything 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.579
 if you do n't have a fast car, here it is 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.130

 that boat they call yachts 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.860
 however this is a bit more difficult 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.860
 that's why the boat moves 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:08.610

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:15.270
