 is that I warned 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.550
 as much as chiles 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.960
 once it's smooth we're going to 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.780
 liquefy 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.310
 and we're going to liquefy them, we're just going 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.900
 to put a small piece of garlic and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.720
 this and here as I see I have chops 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.140
 body these are coming as well as with a 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.440
 I'm going to make them in bits in 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.250
 cubitos cuadritos guys and I'm going to 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.140
 put in a pan to fry I'm going to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:35.740
 fry until they are sewed very well 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.260
 and only after they put them in 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.860
 I will season them with salt and 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.570
 pepper is all I 'm going to 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 season once you cut the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.090
 ulna and put them in the arts 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 i 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 do not 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.520
 carmen de puerto our internet of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.190
 money making ports 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.190
 this is the calcite that we educate in this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.480
 quake 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 then part of a little 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.240
 Well, we do not want our sauce 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.240
 is multicooker because how are we going 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.090
 to make the broth 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.950
 so 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.540
 and more or less 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:41.780
 only now 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.849
 you have to leave it that kid bar and that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.750
 you have to rectify your taste of salt if you 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.460
 it takes 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.550
 and this 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.710
 and that's how our pork with 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.569
 salsita 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.310
 that while carlos a 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.030
