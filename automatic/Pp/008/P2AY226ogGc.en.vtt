00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that I'm in tune if I just change the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.359 
that I'm in tune if I just change the
display<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> back<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.970> it's<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:07.369> second

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
display at the back here it's the second

display at the back here it's the second
one<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.930> goes<00:01:10.110> through

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
one and just see it goes through

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.810 
one and just see it goes through
different<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> first<00:01:15.119> setting

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
different so that's the first setting

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:33.030 
different so that's the first setting
who's<00:01:17.820> number<00:01:18.000> two

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.290 

so<00:01:34.040> someone<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.430> get<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> green<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.090> middle

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
so someone to get a green in the middle

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:52.430 
so someone to get a green in the middle
here's<00:01:35.450> number<00:01:35.630> three

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.710 

and<00:01:53.440> here's<00:01:53.680> number<00:01:53.920> four<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:58.479> more<00:01:58.659> like

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
and here's number four that's more like

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.200 
and here's number four that's more like
the<00:01:58.990> Peterson<00:01:59.470> sort<00:01:59.740> of<00:01:59.890> strobe<00:02:00.159> thing<00:02:00.490> it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the Peterson sort of strobe thing it

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.210 
the Peterson sort of strobe thing it
depends<00:02:01.600> upon<00:02:01.690> which<00:02:02.020> display<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.740> find<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
depends upon which display you find the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.600 
depends upon which display you find the
easiest<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.700> work<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:06.190> nice<00:02:06.430> and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
easiest to work with it's nice and

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.410 
easiest to work with it's nice and
bright<00:02:06.790> so<00:02:07.149> in<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:08.649> gig<00:02:08.979> situation<00:02:09.610> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
bright so in the in a gig situation you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.210 
bright so in the in a gig situation you
can<00:02:10.600> visually<00:02:11.020> see<00:02:11.050> exactly<00:02:11.770> what<00:02:12.069> you're

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
can visually see exactly what you're

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.979 
can visually see exactly what you're
doing<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.440> last<00:02:14.650> one

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.259 

and<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.319> devote<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.739> ammonia<00:02:26.120> which<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
and then we devote an ammonia which is

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.660 
and then we devote an ammonia which is
the<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:27.540> outside<00:02:27.840> currently<00:02:28.349> use<00:02:28.670> very

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the one outside currently use very

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.320 
the one outside currently use very
usable<00:02:30.230> great<00:02:31.230> tuna<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.980> lot<00:02:32.849> more<00:02:33.000> expensive

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
usable great tuna a lot more expensive

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.910 
usable great tuna a lot more expensive
than<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> little<00:02:34.019> ones<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.739> this

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
than the little ones that you get this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.770 
than the little ones that you get this
is<00:02:35.099> about<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.459> 68<00:02:36.000> pounds<00:02:36.239> something<00:02:36.660> like

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
is about the 68 pounds something like

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.050 
is about the 68 pounds something like
that<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.190> turns<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.640> string<00:02:38.940> at<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
that but as it turns one string at a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.600 
that but as it turns one string at a
time<00:02:39.269> it's<00:02:39.870> very<00:02:40.230> good<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.459> works

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
time it's very good and it works

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.339 
time it's very good and it works
