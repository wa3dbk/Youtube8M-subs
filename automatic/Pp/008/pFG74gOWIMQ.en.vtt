this<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.130> piece<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.550> need<00:02:11.580> right

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is the piece that you need right

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.150 
this is the piece that you need right
here<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:13.080> happens<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
here and what happens is if you take a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.500 
here and what happens is if you take a
look<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:15.740> we<00:02:16.740> put<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.420> basically<00:02:18.420> right

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
look at it we put that basically right

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.510 
look at it we put that basically right
there<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:19.110> not<00:02:19.290> an<00:02:19.410> exact<00:02:19.710> fit<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.370> your

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
there it's not an exact fit so your

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.130 
there it's not an exact fit so your
that's<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:20.940> you're<00:02:21.120> gonna<00:02:21.210> need<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.990> knife

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
that's what you're gonna need the knife

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.650 
that's what you're gonna need the knife
for<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.310> fits<00:02:23.550> snugly<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
for is that so that it fits snugly and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.650 
for is that so that it fits snugly and
then<00:02:24.840> fits<00:02:25.110> down<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.500> top<00:02:26.120> all<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.510> after

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
then fits down on top all right so after

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.770 
then fits down on top all right so after
you've<00:02:27.900> done<00:02:29.120> modifying<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:30.600> see

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
you've done modifying as you can see

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.470 
you've done modifying as you can see
it's<00:02:30.930> not<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.490> perfectly<00:02:32.970> aligned<00:02:33.300> but

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
it's not it's not perfectly aligned but

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.970 
it's not it's not perfectly aligned but
just<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.750> show<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.960> how<00:02:34.140> little<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.590> actually

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
just to show you how little it actually

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.040 
just to show you how little it actually
is<00:02:35.130> those<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.420> little<00:02:36.630> shavings

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
is those are all the little shavings

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.740 
is those are all the little shavings
that<00:02:37.230> I've<00:02:37.320> used<00:02:37.590> from<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> knife<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.750> when

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
that I've used from the knife and when

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.420 
that I've used from the knife and when
you<00:02:39.840> put<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.400> should<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:42.530> fairly<00:02:43.530> snug<00:02:43.710> I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
you put it on it should be fairly snug I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.450 
you put it on it should be fairly snug I
mean<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.380> basically<00:02:46.380> feels<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.190> should

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
mean it's basically feels like it should

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.400 
mean it's basically feels like it should
be<00:02:47.640> there<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.060> snaps<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.110> going

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
be there it snaps on and it's not going

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.780 
be there it snaps on and it's not going
anywhere

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
anywhere

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.740 
anywhere
so<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> first<00:02:51.360> part<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
so this is the first part of the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.270 
so this is the first part of the
modification<00:02:54.590> all<00:02:55.590> right<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> next<00:02:56.070> thing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
modification all right so the next thing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
modification all right so the next thing
you're<00:02:56.430> gonna<00:02:56.580> do<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.030> after<00:02:57.690> you've<00:02:58.020> done

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you're gonna do is after you've done

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.200 
you're gonna do is after you've done
that<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.560> smooth<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.280> inside<00:02:59.640> well

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that and you smooth out the inside well

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.940 
that and you smooth out the inside well
you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.660> hour<00:03:00.780> later<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.320> look

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you can do that an hour later you look

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.880 
you can do that an hour later you look
on<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.270> little<00:03:03.480> groove<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.800> of

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
on here there is a little groove kind of

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500 
on here there is a little groove kind of
hard<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> see<00:03:05.220> on<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.550> you're<00:03:06.210> basically

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
hard to see on here you're basically

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.840 
hard to see on here you're basically
going<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.780> that's<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.320> line<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.650> cut<00:03:07.850> with

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
going to that's your line to cut with

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.090 
going to that's your line to cut with
your<00:03:08.880> hacksaw<00:03:09.470> cut<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:12.740> so<00:03:13.740> after

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
your hacksaw cut right there so after

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.770 
your hacksaw cut right there so after
you've<00:03:14.220> cut<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.550> in<00:03:14.640> half<00:03:14.850> you're<00:03:15.510> gonna<00:03:15.630> have

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you've cut it in half you're gonna have

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.300 
you've cut it in half you're gonna have
two<00:03:15.959> pieces<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.740> piece<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.190> you're

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
two pieces this is the piece that you're

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.520 
two pieces this is the piece that you're
going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.520> use<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.360> part<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.720> we<00:03:18.840> shaped<00:03:19.350> out

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
going to use the part that we shaped out

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.720 
going to use the part that we shaped out
the<00:03:19.620> inside<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:21.180> other<00:03:21.360> side<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:22.740> just

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
the inside for the other side you just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.140 
the inside for the other side you just
toss<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:25.890> can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.760> inside

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
toss it as you can see that the inside

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.199 
toss it as you can see that the inside
is<00:03:27.360> very<00:03:27.390> very<00:03:27.750> rough<00:03:28.490> so<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:29.850> need<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.060> have

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
is very very rough so we need to have

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.660 
is very very rough so we need to have
this<00:03:30.360> as<00:03:30.630> absolutely<00:03:31.050> smooth<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.380> possible<00:03:31.830> so

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
this as absolutely smooth as possible so

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.010 
this as absolutely smooth as possible so
that's<00:03:32.790> where<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> sandpaper<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> gonna<00:03:33.870> come

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
that's where a sandpaper is gonna come

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.940 
that's where a sandpaper is gonna come
into<00:03:34.140> play<00:03:36.350> okay<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.410> after<00:03:37.650> you've<00:03:37.920> used

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
into play okay so after you've used

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.610 
into play okay so after you've used
sandpaper<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.760> literally<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.230> all<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
sandpaper and literally that is all the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.270 
sandpaper and literally that is all the
sandpaper<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.130> used<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.959> want<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.260> get<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
sandpaper I used and you want to get the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.310 
sandpaper I used and you want to get the
the<00:03:44.640> edges<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.390> smooth<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:48.170> clean<00:03:49.170> as

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
the edges to be as smooth and clean as

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.130 
the edges to be as smooth and clean as
possible<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:50.610> when<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.080> when<00:03:52.080> you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
possible because when you when you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.320 
possible because when you when you
actually<00:03:52.290> glue<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.130> lens<00:03:53.310> onto<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.090> want

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
actually glue the lens onto it you want

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.720 
actually glue the lens onto it you want
it<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.720> pretty<00:03:55.410> tight<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.250> an<00:03:56.340> easy<00:03:56.459> way<00:03:56.610> to

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
it to be pretty tight so an easy way to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.110 
it to be pretty tight so an easy way to
do<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.630> put<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.020> along<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.380> table<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
do it is to put it along the table and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.610 
do it is to put it along the table and
then<00:04:00.120> see<00:04:00.360> if<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.630> see<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.140> any<00:04:01.320> light

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
then see if you can see like any light

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.520 
then see if you can see like any light
as<00:04:02.430> you're<00:04:02.580> turning<00:04:02.880> around<00:04:02.970> if<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.390> do<00:04:03.630> you

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
as you're turning around if you do you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.990 
as you're turning around if you do you
can<00:04:04.680> tell<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.980> it's<00:04:05.160> uneven<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.820> might

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
can tell that it's uneven and you might

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.830 
can tell that it's uneven and you might
need<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.810> stand<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.290> part<00:04:07.530> down<00:04:07.680> but

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
need to like stand that part down but

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.570 
need to like stand that part down but
for<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> get<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.370> done

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
for right now I have to get that done

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.040 
for right now I have to get that done
you're<00:04:11.700> gonna<00:04:11.790> take<00:04:12.030> your<00:04:12.120> sharpie<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.690> you

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
you're gonna take your sharpie and you

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.150 
you're gonna take your sharpie and you
are<00:04:13.890> going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:15.470> darken<00:04:16.470> out<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.799> gonna<00:04:16.950> black

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
are going to darken out your gonna black

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.129 
are going to darken out your gonna black
out<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.880> inside<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.330> this

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.020 

okay<00:04:22.139> so<00:04:22.199> after<00:04:22.470> you've<00:04:22.860> blackened<00:04:23.850> out<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
okay so after you've blackened out the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.080 
okay so after you've blackened out the
inside<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.389> did<00:04:24.750> about<00:04:25.260> three<00:04:25.590> passes<00:04:26.070> with<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
inside I did about three passes with the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.879 
inside I did about three passes with the
sharpie<00:04:27.600> there<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:27.960> let<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.139> draw<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.740> did

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
sharpie there and let it draw in and did

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.650 
sharpie there and let it draw in and did
it<00:04:28.979> again<00:04:29.190> because<00:04:29.430> anything<00:04:30.180> is<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.510> want

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
it again because anything is you want

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.450 
it again because anything is you want
that<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.990> be<00:04:31.110> as<00:04:31.229> black<00:04:31.650> as<00:04:31.860> possible<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:32.400> that

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
that to be as black as possible so that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.969 
that to be as black as possible so that
you<00:04:32.669> don't<00:04:32.850> get<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.080> reflection<00:04:34.440> from<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
you don't get the reflection from the

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.969 
you don't get the reflection from the
white<00:04:35.190> back<00:04:36.120> on<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.330> inside<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.830> next

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
white back on the inside so the next

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.810 
white back on the inside so the next
thing<00:04:38.070> we're<00:04:38.190> gonna<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:39.320> get<00:04:40.320> our<00:04:40.440> lens

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
thing we're gonna do is get our lens

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.129 
thing we're gonna do is get our lens
this<00:04:41.820> one<00:04:42.000> those<00:04:42.180> 58<00:04:43.340> millimeters<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:45.139> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
this one those 58 millimeters and the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.070 
this one those 58 millimeters and the
reason<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:47.240> went<00:04:48.240> with<00:04:48.389> this<00:04:48.510> one<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.870> because

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
reason I went with this one is because

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.700 
reason I went with this one is because
of<00:04:49.680> how<00:04:50.370> close<00:04:50.699> it<00:04:50.910> actually<00:04:51.300> fits<00:04:51.650> all<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
of how close it actually fits all the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.129 
of how close it actually fits all the
way<00:04:53.010> around<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.860> how<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.070> looks<00:04:56.630> if<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.960> use

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
way around to how that looks if you use

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.200 
way around to how that looks if you use
a<00:04:58.169> different<00:04:58.530> bottle<00:04:59.130> than<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.790> one<00:04:59.940> that<00:04:59.970> I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
a different bottle than the one that I

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.420 
a different bottle than the one that I
used<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:00.600> this<00:05:00.720> video<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.919> may<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.280> to

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
used in this video you may have to

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.760 
used in this video you may have to
remesh<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.060> get<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> different<00:05:03.540> UV<00:05:04.380> filter

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
remesh and get a different UV filter

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.070 
remesh and get a different UV filter
lens<00:05:05.300> but<00:05:06.300> we're<00:05:06.450> just<00:05:06.630> checking<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.020> make

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
lens but we're just checking to make

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.629 
lens but we're just checking to make
sure<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.410> everything<00:05:07.800> is<00:05:07.889> actually<00:05:08.310> fitting

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
sure that everything is actually fitting

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.100 
sure that everything is actually fitting
and<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:09.300> looks<00:05:09.510> like<00:05:09.570> it's<00:05:09.780> gonna<00:05:09.870> fit

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
and it looks like it's gonna fit

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.830 
and it looks like it's gonna fit
perfectly<00:05:12.500> alright<00:05:13.500> so<00:05:13.770> after<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.190> get<00:05:14.840> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
perfectly alright so after you get the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.320 
perfectly alright so after you get the
lens<00:05:16.110> measured<00:05:16.590> you're<00:05:17.160> going<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.580> epoxy<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
lens measured you're going to epoxy the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.930 
lens measured you're going to epoxy the
piece<00:05:19.169> of<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.970> bottle<00:05:20.970> that<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.240> got<00:05:21.419> onto<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
piece of the bottle that we got onto the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.120 
piece of the bottle that we got onto the
the<00:05:23.940> cage<00:05:24.150> itself<00:05:24.600> so<00:05:25.440> like<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.620> said<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.950> stuff

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
the cage itself so like I said the stuff

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.909 
the cage itself so like I said the stuff
that<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.310> was<00:05:26.430> using<00:05:26.610> was<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.720> Loctite<00:05:28.320> epoxy

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
that I was using was the Loctite epoxy

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.610 
that I was using was the Loctite epoxy
sets<00:05:29.370> in<00:05:29.520> about<00:05:29.700> a<00:05:29.729> minute<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.139> don't<00:05:31.500> have

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
sets in about a minute so you don't have

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.350 
sets in about a minute so you don't have
very<00:05:31.650> long<00:05:31.830> so<00:05:32.490> just<00:05:32.520> make<00:05:32.820> sure<00:05:32.970> that<00:05:33.000> around

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
very long so just make sure that around

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.800 
very long so just make sure that around
each<00:05:33.600> side<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:34.410> looks<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:34.650> everything<00:05:35.250> is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
each side it looks like everything is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.640 
each side it looks like everything is
covered<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:37.050> there<00:05:37.169> are<00:05:37.289> no<00:05:37.440> empty

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
covered and that there are no empty

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.650 
covered and that there are no empty
spots<00:05:38.070> you<00:05:38.669> can<00:05:38.700> probably<00:05:39.090> dunk<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.539> in<00:05:39.630> water

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
spots you can probably dunk it in water

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.990 
spots you can probably dunk it in water
at<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.289> point<00:05:40.410> just<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.490> make<00:05:41.669> sure<00:05:41.700> that

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
at this point just to make sure that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.730 
at this point just to make sure that
there<00:05:42.120> are<00:05:42.240> no<00:05:42.389> spots<00:05:43.139> you<00:05:43.320> want<00:05:43.349> to<00:05:43.530> make<00:05:43.620> sure

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
there are no spots you want to make sure

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.770 
there are no spots you want to make sure
that<00:05:43.800> there's<00:05:43.979> no<00:05:44.250> water<00:05:44.479> coming<00:05:45.479> in<00:05:45.630> through

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
that there's no water coming in through

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.330 
that there's no water coming in through
here<00:05:46.020> because<00:05:46.229> this<00:05:46.320> needs<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.860> be<00:05:46.950> watertight

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
here because this needs to be watertight

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.800 
here because this needs to be watertight
there<00:05:47.729> can't<00:05:47.910> be<00:05:48.000> any<00:05:48.180> water<00:05:48.389> in<00:05:48.479> there<00:05:48.570> after

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
there can't be any water in there after

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.489 
there can't be any water in there after
we're<00:05:49.050> done

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:51.499 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.709 

final<00:05:52.499> step<00:05:52.680> making<00:05:53.580> sure<00:05:53.849> that<00:05:53.999> it<00:05:54.150> is<00:05:54.180> epoxy

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
final step making sure that it is epoxy

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.170 
final step making sure that it is epoxy
Don<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.199> then<00:05:55.860> all<00:05:56.099> the<00:05:56.400> way<00:05:56.520> around<00:05:56.819> you<00:05:57.029> want

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
Don and then all the way around you want

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.959 
Don and then all the way around you want
to<00:05:57.210> make<00:05:57.270> sure<00:05:57.509> that<00:05:57.689> there<00:05:57.870> are<00:05:58.020> no<00:05:58.199> places

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
to make sure that there are no places

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:02.360 
to make sure that there are no places
for<00:05:59.969> air<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.389> get<00:06:00.539> in<00:06:01.099> anywhere

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
for air to get in anywhere

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.969 
for air to get in anywhere
