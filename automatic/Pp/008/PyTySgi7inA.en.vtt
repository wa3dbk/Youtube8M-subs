there the analogy I'd like to make is

there the analogy I'd like to make is
towards<00:01:27.450> stringed<00:01:28.049> instruments<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.009> the

towards stringed instruments just the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.810 
towards stringed instruments just the

anything like one another they are based

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.359 
anything like one another they are based
on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:36.990> principle<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.979> string

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

things<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:08.009> you'll<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.580> pictures<00:02:09.390> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
things that like you'll see pictures of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
things that like you'll see pictures of
two<00:02:09.899> got<00:02:10.080> two<00:02:10.410> guys<00:02:10.560> playing<00:02:10.950> at<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> same

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
two got two guys playing at the same

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.520 
two got two guys playing at the same
time<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.730> an<00:02:11.819> orchestra

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
time at an orchestra

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.650 
time at an orchestra
it's<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> whole<00:02:13.790> world<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.360> them<00:02:14.510> out

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
it's really a whole world of them out

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's really a whole world of them out
there<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.140> I'm<00:02:15.650> not<00:02:15.800> really<00:02:15.980> an<00:02:16.160> expert<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.819> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
there and I'm not really an expert but I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.470 
there and I'm not really an expert but I
took<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.410> weekender<00:02:18.920> out<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.459> bought<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.450> just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
took the weekender out I bought it just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.710 
took the weekender out I bought it just
for<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.990> guys<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.530> what<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.550> does<00:02:22.819> is<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.420> The

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
for you guys and what it does is it The

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.050 
for you guys and what it does is it The
Tremeloes<00:02:23.959> got<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.770> when<00:02:25.610> you're<00:02:25.760> when<00:02:25.910> you're

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
Tremeloes got to when you're when you're

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.180 
Tremeloes got to when you're when you're
playing<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:27.050> two<00:02:27.260> notes<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.830> notes<00:02:27.980> are

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
playing the two notes the notes are

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.030 
playing the two notes the notes are
offset<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.030> pitch<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.900> get<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.230> neat<00:02:30.560> sort<00:02:30.950> of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
offset in pitch to get this neat sort of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.620 
offset in pitch to get this neat sort of
sort<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.489> effect<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.150> think<00:02:32.180> they<00:02:32.569> were

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
sort of effect and I think they were

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.100 
sort of effect and I think they were
used<00:02:33.430> for<00:02:34.430> different<00:02:34.520> types<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:35.030> folk<00:02:35.300> music<00:02:35.330> I

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
used for different types of folk music I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.380 
used for different types of folk music I
think<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.770> them<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.160> campfire<00:02:37.550> harps<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
think of them as like campfire harps and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.600 
think of them as like campfire harps and
what<00:02:39.110> you'll<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:39.860> neat<00:02:40.160> let<00:02:40.400> me<00:02:40.489> see

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
what you'll get is this neat let me see

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.430 
what you'll get is this neat let me see
if<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.910> do<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.870> sort<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.200> beating

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
if I can do it here that sort of beating

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.380 
if I can do it here that sort of beating
sound<00:02:45.920> that's<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.640> two<00:02:46.880> notes<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.300> are

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
sound that's the two notes that are

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.940 
sound that's the two notes that are
slightly<00:02:47.540> off<00:02:47.750> pitch<00:02:48.050> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.680> working

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
slightly off pitch kind of working

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.530 
slightly off pitch kind of working
together<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.430> make<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.000> make<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> different

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
together to make up to make a different

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.720 
together to make up to make a different
note<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> figured<00:02:52.550> out

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
note and so what what I figured out

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.750 
note and so what what I figured out
recently<00:02:53.800> because<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.890> just<00:02:55.070> got<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.580> really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
recently because it just got it I really

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.979 
recently because it just got it I really
don't<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:56.209> know<00:02:56.360> what<00:02:56.480> I'm<00:02:56.570> doing

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
don't really know what I'm doing

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.880 
don't really know what I'm doing
is<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.190> need<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.550> think<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.769> think<00:03:00.769> of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
is that you need to think of think of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.120 
is that you need to think of think of
these<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:02.980> clusters<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.010> four<00:03:04.819> because<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:06.709> in

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
these in clusters of four because the in

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.420 
these in clusters of four because the in
that<00:03:07.519> cluster<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.030> flow<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.600> four<00:03:09.050> one<00:03:09.860> row<00:03:10.100> is

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that cluster of flow of four one row is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.970 
that cluster of flow of four one row is
the<00:03:10.640> blow<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.120> one<00:03:11.300> row<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.750> draw<00:03:12.170> so

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the blow and one row is the draw so

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.590 
the blow and one row is the draw so
you're<00:03:13.130> not<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.550> get<00:03:13.790> because<00:03:14.330> there's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
you're not going to get because there's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.460 
you're not going to get because there's
there's<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.989> there's<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.290> this<00:03:15.620> two<00:03:15.769> notes<00:03:16.010> per

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
there's a there's a this two notes per

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.009 
there's a there's a this two notes per
per<00:03:18.470> column<00:03:19.070> if<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.370> will<00:03:19.630> you're<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:20.810> going

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
per column if you will you're not going

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.270 
per column if you will you're not going
to<00:03:21.079> be<00:03:21.200> able<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.410> play<00:03:21.620> blow<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:21.980> draw<00:03:22.100> on<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
to be able to play blow and draw on the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.800 
to be able to play blow and draw on the
same<00:03:22.489> note<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.910> sort<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.269> have<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.450> think

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
same note so you sort of have to think

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.770 
same note so you sort of have to think
of<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.079> as<00:03:24.549> as<00:03:25.549> one<00:03:26.030> hole<00:03:26.209> as<00:03:26.360> being<00:03:26.600> that

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
of it as as one hole as being that

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.229 
of it as as one hole as being that
cluster<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.200> four<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.670> seems<00:03:29.060> like

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
cluster of four and then it seems like

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.270 
cluster of four and then it seems like
the<00:03:29.540> tuning<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.049> something<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:31.010> middle

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
the tuning is something like the middle

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.130 
the tuning is something like the middle
of<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.459> diatonic<00:03:31.940> or<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.329> chromatic<00:03:32.870> harmonica

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
of a diatonic or a chromatic harmonica

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.580 
of a diatonic or a chromatic harmonica
so<00:03:33.890> sort<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.790> an<00:03:34.910> in/out<00:03:35.209> pattern<00:03:35.750> will<00:03:36.350> give

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so sort of an in/out pattern will give

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.039 
so sort of an in/out pattern will give
you<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.489> basic<00:03:37.940> major<00:03:38.150> type<00:03:38.540> scale<00:03:38.840> see

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
you that that basic major type scale see

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.110 
you that that basic major type scale see
if<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.170> can<00:03:39.290> do<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.680> think<00:03:40.459> it's<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.760> C<00:03:40.970> but

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
if I can do it I think it's in C but

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:50.699 
if I can do it I think it's in C but
it's<00:03:41.269> not<00:03:41.390> stamped<00:03:41.840> on<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.200> what<00:03:42.350> do<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.470> know

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.990 

so<00:03:51.709> there's<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:51.980> there's<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.250> C<00:03:52.459> scale<00:03:52.760> so

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
so there's that there's a C scale so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.210 
so there's that there's a C scale so
what<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.180> did<00:03:53.269> was<00:03:53.570> um<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.109> don't<00:03:54.829> even<00:03:54.980> know<00:03:55.100> what

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
what I did was um I don't even know what

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.650 
what I did was um I don't even know what
the<00:03:55.310> numbers<00:03:55.579> are<00:03:55.700> but<00:03:57.910> it's<00:03:58.910> blow<00:03:59.269> draw<00:03:59.630> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
the numbers are but it's blow draw a
