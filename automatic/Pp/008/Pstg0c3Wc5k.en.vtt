notice<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.140> went<00:03:56.350> first<00:03:56.500> foot<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.040> try<00:03:57.190> and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
notice I went first foot to try and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.880 
notice I went first foot to try and
again<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.090> alert<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.840> other<00:03:59.410> members<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.800> the

again to alert the other members of the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.479 
again to alert the other members of the
Patrol

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
Patrol

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.010 
Patrol
it<00:04:00.880> doesn't<00:04:01.209> work<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.570> time<00:04:01.840> unfortunately

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
it doesn't work this time unfortunately

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.740 
it doesn't work this time unfortunately
so<00:04:02.890> we<00:04:03.310> try<00:04:03.520> a<00:04:03.550> few<00:04:03.670> random<00:04:04.060> shots<00:04:04.510> and

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
so we try a few random shots and

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.670 
so we try a few random shots and
grenades<00:04:05.080> just<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.470> get<00:04:05.590> their<00:04:05.709> attention

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
grenades just to get their attention

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.820 
grenades just to get their attention
the<00:04:08.680> reason<00:04:08.980> for<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.370> it<00:04:09.550> brings<00:04:09.850> out<00:04:10.120> the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
the reason for this is it brings out the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.740 
the reason for this is it brings out the
load<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:12.040> next<00:04:12.280> patrol<00:04:12.670> out<00:04:12.940> into<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.390> open

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
load the next patrol out into the open

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.030 
load the next patrol out into the open
and<00:04:18.630> out<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> open<00:04:19.989> are<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.470> lot<00:04:20.620> easier<00:04:20.650> to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
and out in the open are a lot easier to

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.250 
and out in the open are a lot easier to
take<00:04:21.310> out<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.910> now<00:04:22.510> we've<00:04:22.690> got<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:22.960> retention

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
take out so now we've got the retention

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.500 
take out so now we've got the retention
we'll<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.040> take<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> few<00:04:24.520> shots<00:04:24.730> up<00:04:25.000> there<00:04:25.030> and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
we'll just take a few shots up there and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:38.220 
we'll just take a few shots up there and
finish<00:04:26.169> them<00:04:26.380> up

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.660 

there's<00:04:39.230> about<00:04:39.290> six<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.950> them<00:04:40.130> by<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.370> looks

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
there's about six of them by the looks

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.250 
there's about six of them by the looks
of<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.940> from<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:41.630> I<00:04:41.870> think<00:04:42.050> having

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
of it from this because I think having

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.110 
of it from this because I think having
active<00:04:42.680> warriors<00:04:43.040> up<00:04:43.190> they<00:04:43.400> have<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.670> annoy<00:04:43.880> to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
active warriors up they have to annoy to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.060 
active warriors up they have to annoy to
obtain<00:04:44.360> four<00:04:46.660> media<00:04:47.660> area<00:04:48.020> done<00:04:48.230> fine<00:04:49.040> a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
obtain four media area done fine a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.600 
obtain four media area done fine a
little<00:04:49.430> bit<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.530> little<00:04:52.100> bit<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.370> problem

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
little bit is a little bit of a problem

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.340 
little bit is a little bit of a problem
with<00:04:52.880> some<00:04:53.150> Gilley's<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.690> we've<00:04:53.840> got<00:04:54.050> off<00:04:54.200> in

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
with some Gilley's that we've got off in

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.580 
with some Gilley's that we've got off in
the<00:04:54.470> distance<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.310> now<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.450> area<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.230> very

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the distance and now this area is very

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.310 
the distance and now this area is very
hard<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.190> what<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.150> a<00:04:59.240> good<00:04:59.360> idea<00:04:59.750> is<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.110> take

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
hard so what it's a good idea is to take

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.460 
hard so what it's a good idea is to take
a<00:05:00.350> take<00:05:01.280> a<00:05:01.310> shot<00:05:01.700> from<00:05:01.910> them<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.750> find<00:05:03.230> out<00:05:03.350> the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
a take a shot from them and find out the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.400 
a take a shot from them and find out the
direction<00:05:03.710> like<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.340> did<00:05:04.550> just<00:05:04.790> then<00:05:05.170> by<00:05:06.170> using

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
direction like I did just then by using

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.490 
direction like I did just then by using
the<00:05:06.740> hip<00:05:06.890> marker<00:05:07.280> in<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.460> compass<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:09.350> that

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the hip marker in the compass so that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.070 
the hip marker in the compass so that
you<00:05:09.590> can<00:05:09.710> read<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.010> target<00:05:10.570> now<00:05:11.570> although<00:05:11.930> it

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
you can read the target now although it

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.510 
you can read the target now although it
doesn't<00:05:12.260> look<00:05:12.470> like<00:05:12.650> I've<00:05:12.830> hit<00:05:13.040> him<00:05:13.310> I

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
doesn't look like I've hit him I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.970 
doesn't look like I've hit him I
actually<00:05:14.180> have<00:05:14.660> which<00:05:15.440> we<00:05:15.620> find<00:05:15.800> out<00:05:15.950> later

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
actually have which we find out later

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.800 
actually have which we find out later
because<00:05:16.250> obviously<00:05:16.700> he's<00:05:17.120> not<00:05:17.240> shooting<00:05:17.510> at

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
because obviously he's not shooting at

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.930 
because obviously he's not shooting at
us<00:05:17.960> anymore<00:05:18.230> there's<00:05:19.100> five<00:05:19.280> Gilley's<00:05:19.670> in<00:05:19.790> this

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
us anymore there's five Gilley's in this

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.750 
us anymore there's five Gilley's in this
next<00:05:20.180> area<00:05:20.620> there's<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.770> second<00:05:22.160> off<00:05:22.310> in

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
quite close just in in between the tree

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.600 
quite close just in in between the tree
and<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.900> fence<00:05:51.170> if<00:05:51.770> you<00:05:51.980> need<00:05:52.160> to<00:05:52.310> look<00:05:52.430> from
