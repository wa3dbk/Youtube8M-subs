you<00:02:20.670> blend<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.239> two<00:02:21.269> colors<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.319> just

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you blend the two colors because it just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.990 
you blend the two colors because it just
kind<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.800> creates<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.580> kind<00:02:23.879> of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
kind of creates this kind of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.720 
kind of creates this kind of
transformation<00:02:24.950> from<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.160> light<00:02:26.340> color<00:02:26.580> to

transformation from the light color to
the<00:02:26.819> dark<00:02:27.000> color<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> tip<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.580> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
them I know it's that so I just used a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.300 
them I know it's that so I just used a
little<00:04:06.569> bit<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.410> add<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.769> little<00:04:08.069> depth

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
little bit of that to add a little depth

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.640 
little bit of that to add a little depth
to<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.459> crease<00:04:08.989> in<00:04:09.989> here<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.349> add<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
liner nothing spectacular the only thing

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.870 
liner nothing spectacular the only thing
different<00:04:13.260> i<00:04:13.440> guess<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.739> i<00:04:13.799> did<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.579> course<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
different i guess that i did of course I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.750 
different i guess that i did of course I

I'm<00:04:18.799> just<00:04:19.430> instead<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.150> just<00:04:20.419> lining<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.319> I

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
I'm just instead of just lining the I

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.740 
I'm just instead of just lining the I
from<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.949> middle<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.520> end<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.030> lining<00:04:23.660> it

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
from the middle to the end and lining it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.600 
from the middle to the end and lining it
from<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.139> inner<00:04:24.560> corner<00:04:24.710> all<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.250> way<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
from the inner corner all the way to the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.760 
from the inner corner all the way to the
outer<00:04:25.819> corner<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.199> don't<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.680> know

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
outer corner so I don't you know

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.350 
outer corner so I don't you know
sometimes<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.430> don't<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.819> but<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.060> wanted

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
sometimes I don't do that but I wanted

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.749 
sometimes I don't do that but I wanted
to<00:04:29.479> kind<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.050> connect<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.160> bottom<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:31.870> upper

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
to kind of connect the bottom and upper

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.790 
to kind of connect the bottom and upper
line<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.630> I'm<00:04:35.720> lining<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.199> bottom<00:04:36.560> with
