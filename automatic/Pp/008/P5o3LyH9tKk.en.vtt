00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.590
 I'll talk to you today about the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.359
 rolex zinho that is the levezinho the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:28.369
 levezinho should not be news for 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.760
 that because I combine with colleagues 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.239
 1234 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 I had a big class can be 2050 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.879
 a walk in the mall 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.510
 Why are you saying that this is what happened? 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.760
 so strange in this absolutely nothing 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 nothing should happen but in san 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 Paulo and Rio de Janeiro happened the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 what happened to the people who combined 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 to walk 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 nothing happened even if they were 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.710
 try to walk 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 The problem was that these people are not 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 the traditional consumers of shopping 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.960
 are peripheral boys who have combined 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 stroll in the mall and like them 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.890
 told to see the girls to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.909
 watch what's new 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 finally to attend what your 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.740
 siblings and their parents did not 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.960
 were able to attend roseanne sarney is 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.850
 completely right 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.030
 Brazil is having violence because 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.290
 Improved is incredible as it seems 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.780
 that's right 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.549
 when you improve the conditions 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 financial resources of a 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.729
 the urban metropolises grows and the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.469
 violence but it also appears that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:11.009
 also appears that desire of the people 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.490
 the poorer suburbs and attend 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.470
 the places your 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.450
 the elderly and my parents do not 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.630
 could attend 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.530
 nothing more natural for the people of 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.410
 periphery takes the subway comes to the center 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.530
 and they want to go to malls because they 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.890
 What is the big problem with this? 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.210
 problem is that they mark the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 encounter together and this set 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.170
 it's a stain inside the mall that goes 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.060
 walking is a strange spot is not a 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.570
 natural stain is not that stain of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 young 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:56.920
 then clearly middle class 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.170
 appears what appears the strangeness 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.050
 store owners begin to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.810
 wonder that audience is not going to 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.950
 nothing happens, just let that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.200
 public walk but it happens that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 owners in some places 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.450
 freaked out with those figures 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.100
 and call the police when the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.870
 police are called 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.200
 She does not think she's going to be called to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.090
 watch a young people stroll 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.040
 She thinks she's been called because she's 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.380
 happening a theft is happening 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.950
 something strange so it comes with 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.150
 the purpose of repression she comes to look at 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.160
 She thinks it's strange, too. 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.620
 those people in that place because 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.530
 those people in that place do not always 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.170
 are seen and it departs for a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.310
 bellicose behavior with those 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.830
 people and of course this will 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.320
 clash will make a mess 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.190
 How do you solve this if you solve it? 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.800
 this simply by understanding that with 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.440
 any color with any way with 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.350
 any clothing smell 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.610
 people can stroll on the street can 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:19.959
 shopping malls there can be no 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:23.140
 no silencing but if I go 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.330
 use the word yes if by prejudice 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.659
 the police are called to a group 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.090
 of different young people let's say 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.240
 different from what the patrons are 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.419
 Obviously the caller is already 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.610
 calling for repression to contain 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.629
 those which then becomes 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.849
 imagine that 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:50.810
 and then what happened is now 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:56.210
 everybody scared to death behind 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:59.030
 You have to look in the mirror and 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.190
 see your color if you're good, right? 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.169
 mounted and cap 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.479
 if you look like a kid of 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.909
 middle class so you can combine 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.919
 with a colleague your father make a roll 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.139
 but if you do not look like 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.750
 you can not combine with colleagues I 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.479
 Why do not you go? Why? 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.099
 the rich walks the case of the periphery does 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.789
 roll down zezinho 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:26.090
 even this has already been invented 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.560
 so from now on there will be 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.199
 mobilization of people 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.029
 especially those who remained 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.860
 outraged at this type of 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:41.719
 against young people in the sense of 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.009
 protest the malls by 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:48.339
 time they will have to organize themselves and 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:52.370
 understand understand once and for all 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:55.639
 that grow a little improve a 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.529
 just the salary people start to 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:03.080
 appear in places they were not 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:06.469
 I think it's good that we 're going to 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.589
 getting used to it the fastest 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.589
 possible
