00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello very good to all kids are still 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 commenting welcome at level 7 you have 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.120
 inform and prost you this is found 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.880
 in pits castle 1 raining on 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.380
 burned this level and touch is not that I 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.330
 I really like the third currency I know where 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.320
 it's good but nothing comes out 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.720
 quietly 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.220
 of ice as ice comes 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 basically what we have to do in 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.930
 this level is to reach a p button of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.630
 these that converts the coins into 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.119
 blocks and vice versa can be done 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.610
 quite pretty fast if you just 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.350
 then you run through the level basically 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:44.690
 until you get to a switch these are 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.090
 I called the addition is right in the area 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.180
 of the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.560
 of the third currency 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.560
 we passed the area 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.470
 this 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.770
 to see care 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.560
 Be careful because this area 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 It is very tedious because as you can see how 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.580
 you escape some white platform or 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 but well 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.010
 let's go back here we have it and by far 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 watch out 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.080
 avoiding the meteorites 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.780
 run run there is how you see the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.780
 currency 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.670
 and I do not overlook almost almost not what 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.670
 with him 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.250
 same until we reach the level the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.250
 banderita sorry 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.280
 best way and here we have the way 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.280
 secret of this world secret level 7 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.439
 that takes us along the side of the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.439
 castle 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.650
 and it generates us a fair world in the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.550
 side of it 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.320
 we go out there directs the level not 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.260
 I have not even seen how it's called climbing 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.420
 scorching castilla of pitch 4 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.849
 so nothing will see how not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.319
 always for special levels 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.319
 they are on rails why 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.540
 go a good kid because know here 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.489

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.489

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.390

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.239
 up and something we're going we go between those 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.930
 holes I tell you that they will be the second 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.150
 seaweed coin 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.060
 if they do not kill me 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.020

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.760
 great well worth skilled as 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.270
 always in those 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.420
 in those things 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.000
 the black seaman gives me bad but what 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.300
 is usually done many crazy things many 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.300
 times 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.870
 good thing is that there is something more 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.980
 Thank you 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.329

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.859
 tail piece 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:10.620
 we reach some good area 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.620
 I'm not going to take that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.950
 to see where the balls come from 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.810

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.230

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.580
 fixed fall of some old council 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.580

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.419
 I do not want to die 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.680
 I have taken the three coins great 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.600
 that is, I do not care when it reaches 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.230
 level 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.250

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.250

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.539

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.940

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.790

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.990

 everyone has gotten the coins or not 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.260

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.760
