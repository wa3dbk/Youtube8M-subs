00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.250
 This is not the first claim of the British 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 regulator to us we believe that these 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.809
 claims are certainly a way to make 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 us change our editorial policy 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.670
 but put pressure on us and the cat affect us 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.920
 what they tell us they tell us your 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 Ukraine's lighting is biased and not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.510
 balanced I can find every day 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.890
 and every hour on air bbc mass 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.660
 examples of bias and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.340
 imbalances in their lighting 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.189
 Ukraine only this will come Austin 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.270
 imbalance of another kind 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 It turns out that the British regulator 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 draws attention and blames channel 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.090
 that they answer something 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.379
 light come then when the position 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.149
 TV channel at odds with the position 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 actually british state 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 when you do not disagree you can manifest and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.210
 autumn will come and balance but it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 pure censorship is pressure 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 attempt to change our editorial 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.360
 of course we will not change it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 we hope that there are other ways 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.629
 us find a common language with the British 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 regulator something confused me 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.680
 you understand there are 4 materials of some kind 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.070
 specific things and now if you can 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 more that they why now and we 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.950
 we do not know what exactly we are told 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.049
 we believe that this lighting was 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 unbalanced but we here believe that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.130
 coverage of anything that makes russia 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 in the British media 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.869
 to put it mildly not balanced and sometimes 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.130
 just borders on wildness now what are you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 imagine if Russian 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.939
 the regulator began to make a warning 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.320
 bbc and threatens to turn them off on 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.509
 because it seems to them 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 lighting unbalanced it would be 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.140
 for the whole world such a crash that is not enough 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 no one thought but when 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 going on with us 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.549
 Of course this same Russian dare can 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.549
 and you can not treat a pity 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.689
 ladies we called someone said 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 look here in this plot 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.170
 such on materials such and such reports 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.149
 position of Russia is not reflected all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 unbalanced very biased us 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 said oh you know we don't regulate 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 activity would hang in versailles these 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.140
 there is a media regulator that regulates 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.509
 the activities of all media and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 on the territory of all TV channels on 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.260
 the territory of Great Britain is not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.150
 regulates the activities of the most important 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.470
 hanging on the activities 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.240
 hang do you have to them some 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.300
 claims contact davis 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.970
 and also read you too 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.340
 tie in with the launch of your london 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.580
 studios here also tell me in more detail from 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.140
 claims to spring where 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 claims which claims are published 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 Now to our March materials to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.810
 March we literally a few days 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.090
 ago launched their studio in london with 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 she caused a lot of comments 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.990
 the press had a lot of articles and notes 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.840
 the big reaction was the audience we her 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.340
 opened right in front of mi-6 all are healthy 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 and it takes a wonderful few days 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.480
 British regulator comments on our 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.340
 activities say that can deprive 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.260
 Because we consider our license 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.290
 March coverage of Ukrainian events 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.330
 not balanced well, very difficult 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.790
 see in this really 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.040
 fighting for the interests of the British audience 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.430
 fight for freedom of speech for truth 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.440
 democracy we don't see it in that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.540
 really what leverage does this have 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.890
 media regulators can really 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.480
 make a shutdown of course may want 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.840
 can if they want to turn us off 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.120
 they instead of blue put hear 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.430
 blue or i like that blue they 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.350
 would have had to say say blue yes and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.239
 based on this we will be disconnected 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.830
 you understand one thing if we 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.230
 made claims about 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.390
 distortions by us of some facts about 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.480
 I flip something about the fact that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.640
 we violated someoneâ€™s private rights 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.739
 life but no we are told that your 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.200
 lighting is unbalanced and biased 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.820
 but this is very subjective terminology 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.900
 well that means unbalanced will come 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.400
 and what I'm saying now 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.530
 unbalanced biased to someone 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.330
 any media broadcast may seem 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.370
 any channel unbalanced 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.959
 prejudiced when looking overwhelming 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 I have most of the western TV channels 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.170
 indignation boils inside from 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.700
 imbalance bias and then 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.650
 what does it mean to know that they should be in Russia 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.450
 disable if it seems to Russians 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.190
 unbalanced by coming there but it's the same 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.400
 just funny this is no freedom of speech 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.860
 no relationship at all what what are they 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.920
 require to apologize 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.570
 they and the traditional policy of shaniki they 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.359
 want us to change our 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.750
 editorial policy they want us 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.510
 reflected those events and as it seems to them 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.310
 right, we will not do this, we 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.170
 then we are not needed at all if we are 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.240
 do the same thing that bb does and 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.130
 our imbalance bias 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.410
 will be one to one with balance 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:39.700
 and bias bi bios and advance 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.700
 pris ready for anything ready
