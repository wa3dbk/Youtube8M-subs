00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:10.590
 in that bed and says I put here to martÃ­n 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.100
 malharro we miss him son of good to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.189
 tribute and today answered this was the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.199
 video nor do I leave the skin the girl for 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.820
 obviously you can take it all the time 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.259
 who want to stop all the details 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.169
 that you want if you want more than 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.079
 two noses teeth the recuerditos 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.759
 it depends on your imagination and 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:33.630
 you do an interest and the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.730
 next craft is going to be nothing more and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.020
 nothing less take note because I'm going to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:45.900
 give all materials and supplies 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:52.350
 economic umbrella paint for fabric 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:55.230
 Sponge brush clay and plastic cups 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.219
 afterwards and what do you think I'm going to create 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.089
 fast to my island to see an island without 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:09.979
 79 much I have here already steps 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.979
 why do you think 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 it is assumed that the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 umbrella inside a closed place but 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.729
 as here the imagination does not have 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.190
 limits and they did not see me is the most 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.690
 easy then I saw it I already gave it for 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 but the problem is that this 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.520
 shows if I had in the fall that yes 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 I 'm bored with this boy and I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 I'm not going his what was happening that I stopped 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 it's so boring it's so bad but 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.830
 If we have to put a wave on it, let's 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.990
 wave then to see that with this corner 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.990
 When your favorite color I like the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.370
 purple on the green given the purple green 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 and green 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.910
 like the two of us will be enough 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.340
 well because moving one is stopped by the other 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.670
 floor and so also the white can can 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.160
 work and see what contrast 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.740
 here we are, I like it 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.020
 ok the glasses we are going to use them for 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 make the figures we can fill here 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.830
 with your fingers or with a paint brush 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.840
 according to the colors that they like the most and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.420
 then magic magic magic good 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.690
 then we start trees that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.520
 we started to give to demonstrate long 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.900
 you have to give one one I put 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.900
 you put the gold or the green 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.099
 let's see if I can not open the era 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.099
 someone of the motorcycle by studs 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.630
 purple green I like them I like these 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.630
 colors 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.590
 but as if not another truth another one more 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.240
 alive green and the green cited looks father 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.640
 but a yellow would also look very 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.960
 well because that's not how it contrasts so much 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.960
 so then I'll leave you there 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 let's see what happens to us to see 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.410
 imagination and I have already I know instead of 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.930
 just paint the outline of the glass and make 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.250
 the figure so what I'm going to do is 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 paint half of the base of the glass with 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.670
 the color 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.090
 and the other half I paint with another color 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.510
 right now you will see why 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.090
 but I do not think it 's a vast painting that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.190
 do not stay like that, how much entourage is left 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 so have a lot of paint you want to 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 man being woman 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.710
 so 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.370
 and we turn it around a little bit and the project is 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.849
 then mix a little 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.849
 colors 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.770
 you saw is mixing with another color 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.480
 then also with another color we can not 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.020
 go doing the filling and it looks like 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.230
 electrical medium as well as you know 11 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.820
 destroys as electronic as electric 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:17.140
 a brutality called satan explained more 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:21.040
 beautiful second no and me and I am going to use 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.890
 the white jetecate nothing but the beauty 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.910
 what are we going to do 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.910
 look no more 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.339
 hsbc 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.870
 what's up that I think is what happened I do not know 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.870
 nothing of what 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.320
 yes i am a great guy 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.570
 please walk in search of 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.570
 being in search of s 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.800
 and those who say they are the best are 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.800
 the worst 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.639
 fill your heart 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.639
 good good the umbrella there 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.770
 since we walk with the green west you 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.820
 like the wave well on 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.080
 If you have life, I'm rather shy 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.080
 and I vent the colors 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:48.550
 look we are putting ideas 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.960
 different for example the heart and the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.480
 circle that we did for how it is 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.210
 different 8 youtube but they are ideas for 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.540
 that you make the whole umbrella as 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.570
 a clear idea and why not of what 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.400
 throw another design let's see the step 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.770
 to add I think we're going to see 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.930
 you need to be very clear about what the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.610
 design what do you want to do with the help of 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.860
 the clay that is the small square that is 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.020
 used to paint on fabrics then 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.970
 you make the brand and the design already when 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.580
 have all the brands you start 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.199
 paint slowly calmly the brushes 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.509
 sponges are very useful to do 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.070
 lines or circles with the help of 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.350
 plastic cups you can also make 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.539
 circles and they are very pretty as 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.340
 It is advisable to start with the center and 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.259
 and then towards the shores so we 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.090
 spots remember that it has to be 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.169
 fabric paint to last longer your 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:44.630
 design and then right now we are looking at 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.630
 Diana how do you draw with the stands 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.310
 and if you do not know that already once you go 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.740
 seeing this from the imagination to the plane 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.840
 here in the hands already when you draw it is 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.470
 much simpler and I love them 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.860
 I want to teach them how to teach him 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.070
 his umbrella was left to my next future 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.850
 girl the girl for of flown that the 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.850
 paid girl 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.580
 what causes a lot of wave very good wave to 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.680
 all the colors that you want up to 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:26.320
 a shepherd to make it rain because I 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.320
 because it's a funny rain 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.440
 Well, now let's see a 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:39.410
 third 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.600
 craft and two while here my girl 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.140

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.420

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:51.420
 Underlying garbage
