00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 which I use in separate small bottles 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.530
 care of my skin

 today I'm using to remove the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.750
 makeup this argan oil is not oil 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 coconut in the trips because the oil that 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.730
 consuming condensate and glass and is more 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.370
 difficult to travel mentally I 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.280
 I prefer argan oil besides caring for it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.320
 very well from my skin it removes 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.390
 incredible makeup 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.880
 Role of his rose can, yes, take care of it. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 much of the skin moisturized enough to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.729
 take off the makeup I usually use 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.130
 Cotton wool or handkerchiefs 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.540
 depends on my routine 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 depends on what my skin is 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.100
 need that soap that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.560
 I'm using that, see that bottle. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.040
 Little is the famous clinical soap 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.840
 that I always wear my fur and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.840
 I wash very well afterwards, do not go river and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.479
 I'll tell you later, I like the water. 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.049
 cool enough to leave 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.439

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.000
 the whole treatment begins 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 one of those who train that is to give kiko to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.040
 It is easy to carry that was the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.500
 I really like this credit to take these 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.810

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.970
 brightness it handles very well for the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.520

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.140

 very 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.370
