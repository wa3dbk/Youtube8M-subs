00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.650
 Hello everyone, lidar murtazin and u 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.230

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 speakers budget tablet with 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.000
 10 inch screen hd resolution 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.970
 which has great viewing angles because 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.089
 what is it and the peas matrix but not from this 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.050
 should just screen such a nice tab 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.650
 a 10 is the top of the budget line from 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.710
 lenovo 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.870
 worth it is not a budget written worth 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 about 12 thousand rubles seems to me all 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.590
 Still budget is when the device is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.809
 somewhat less money if we talk about 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.359
 performance they release with multicolored 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.690
 here is a dark blue body which 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.090
 Russia is delivered literally for everyone 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.230
 these devices dolby inscription because 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.079
 two stereo speakers and dolby micro and here 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.670
 im micro usb card spree 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.500
 double key supported 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.750
 volume control three and a half 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.750
 millimeter for audio tightly closed 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.430
 so the 5 megapixel camera is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.710
 front-camera 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.120
 Now I am offered as if 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.590
 The first front camera is located 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.160
 here when you first start me 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.600
 It is proposed to configure this device I 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.600
 accept agreement 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.860
 let's say i want 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.460
 so i want to set up connection now 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.090
 not very clear 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.690
 and 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.370
 fine 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.910
 get the first run 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.030
 That's how all the lenovo tablets run 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.660
 without exception, that is, here we can 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.850
 watch a video about this tablet weather 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.190

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.209
 2 media so 83 82 enough 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.790
 productive solution it costs at 8 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.370
 800 6582 Tablet 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.310

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.380
 gigabytes of internal memory and enough 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.890
 A good screen, that is, of all 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.260
 tablets and a series of the most good 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.739
 the screen is the power controller which 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.230
 accustomed to other tablet from lenovo 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.010
 that is, the settings that are here 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.880
 this neck 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.670
 Sigt hd is the synchronization of all your 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.780
 contacts archiving them in the cloud on 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.610
 sd card and plus of course this tablet 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.570
 you can call it 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.500

 there is all the index services is a disk than 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.920
 disk disk 1 index another google disk 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.920

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.130
 taxi there and slender radio radio not from 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.220
 Yandex Yandex maps and Yandex top that is 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.829
 everything is quite typical here on my 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.650
 look here i will just show how you changed 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.920
 standard things are generally characteristic 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.560
 for lenovo you can't call it a shell 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.239
 here it is android 4 2 2 updates 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.650
 arrive often enough but when 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.880
 update will arrive 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.289
 straight on 43 or 44 unknown not worth it 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.150
 probably count on what it is 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.479
 will happen here literally tomorrow and in general 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.729
 what will happen you buy 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.370
 a tablet that has everything already 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.830
 necessary it works not bad 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.700
 on stereo speakers performance 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.460
 dolby mobile debts support 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.090
 that is, here you can customize these 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.599
 We'll see if I find the badge for a long time. 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.880
 will find 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.620
 let's see how it looks with 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 points of view 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.290
 equalizer settings like this i can for 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:04.030
 music is all the same doing enough 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.919
 not bad in my opinion the device works 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.050
 for a long time im that is not playing 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.410
 the converted video is about eight 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.590
 and a half hours if we talk about 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.490
 at maximum screen brightness if 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.100
 talk about other characteristics then we 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.110
 can brightness by the way automatically in 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.220
 budget devices here are not 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.490
 is regulated 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.500
 Now I set the maximum brightness 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.870
 if we talk about other characteristics 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.970
 this apparatus but here i am right away 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.590
 flew update that I can 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.790
 put for example 33 megabytes now 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.860
 boot and install it then they 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.960
 characteristic for android tablets this 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.389
 good working horse which can be 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.510
 feel free to take a half two three years 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:55.850
 maybe longer it will work but 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.120
 rather morally obsolete faster than 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.970
 something happens to her this parade 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.910
 First of all I like my ip osb 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.789
 the panels are really a plus 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.570
 2 plus is stereo speakers 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:14.810
 but not loud enough and here in general 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:21.940
 can we give the profile and sound 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.940
 look here you can talk about what 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.430
 not sure what you have through my microphone 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:42.630
 it will be heard but not bad in general 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:49.080
 their I I would say that even well that is 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:51.230
 there is no problem if you talk 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.170
 about the possibility of working with this device 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.110
 you can send sms you can receive 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.710
 text messages about calls separate 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.020
 story 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.970
 principle there is a secret how to set it up 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.300
 so that it was all by default with 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.100
 boxes can not call it but 10 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.970
 inches again hardly you will go 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.760
 down the street so attach it and call 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.950
 on this machine in general, how am I 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.290
 the device seems to be interesting 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.570
 quite good by the ratio 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.610
 price-quality details of course 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.310
 read the review on mobile review where we are 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.780
 happy to wait good luck 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.780
 moods for new meetings yet
