oh you have to excuse the fountain noise
I've<00:00:07.980> got<00:00:08.189> my<00:00:08.370> filter<00:00:08.820> part<00:00:09.090> because<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.900> am

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
I've got my filter part because I am

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
I've got my filter part because I am
putting<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> new<00:00:12.750> tank<00:00:13.700> on<00:00:15.320> this

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
putting the one for the new tank on this

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.500 
putting the one for the new tank on this
tank<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.070> get<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> started<00:00:17.880> now<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.390> I'm

doing<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.910> new<00:00:21.119> filter<00:00:22.550> has<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:25.250> section<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
doing the new filter has a section like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.740 
doing the new filter has a section like
this<00:00:28.010> that's<00:00:29.010> supposed<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.730> half<00:00:30.090> carbon

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
this that's supposed to have half carbon

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
this that's supposed to have half carbon
and<00:00:30.990> half<00:00:31.439> bio<00:00:32.040> media<00:00:32.460> well<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.759> putting<00:00:33.000> all

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and half bio media well I'm putting all

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.080 
and half bio media well I'm putting all
bio<00:00:33.600> media<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:35.340> these<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.579> bags

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bio media in it I got these little bags

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.380 
bio media in it I got these little bags
that<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.420> perfect<00:00:36.899> size<00:00:37.610> I've<00:00:38.610> got<00:00:38.850> two<00:00:39.059> kinds

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that are perfect size I've got two kinds

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.220 
that are perfect size I've got two kinds
of<00:00:39.420> bio<00:00:39.629> media<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.260> I've<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> cenotes

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
of bio media here I've got the cenotes

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
of bio media here I've got the cenotes
which<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:45.059> completely

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which are if you can see just completely

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.290 
which are if you can see just completely
covered<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.500> bacteria<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
covered in good bacteria so I'm going to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
covered in good bacteria so I'm going to
take<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> quarter<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.230> them<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> here

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
take about a quarter of them out of here

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.810 
take about a quarter of them out of here
and<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:51.350> them<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.340> these

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and put them in there and then put these

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740 
and put them in there and then put these
which<00:00:54.390> I've<00:00:54.570> also<00:00:54.750> been<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:56.750> there

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
which I've also been in here in there

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
which I've also been in here in there
and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> filter

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and then I'm going to get this filter

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
and then I'm going to get this filter
running<00:01:01.640> because<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:04.140> more<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.830> bacteria

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
running because the more good bacteria

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.609 
running because the more good bacteria
we<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.450> thing<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
we have in this thing when I get the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.410 
we have in this thing when I get the
tank<00:01:07.920> started<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> quicker<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
tank started the quicker it's going to

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.730 
tank started the quicker it's going to
cycle<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.570> said<00:01:12.780> before<00:01:12.930> between

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
cycle so like I've said before between

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
cycle so like I've said before between
I'm<00:01:14.420> putting<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> water<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> what

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I'm putting this water in there and what

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
I'm putting this water in there and what
I've<00:01:18.659> done<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.200> stuff

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I've done with this stuff

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
I've done with this stuff
it<00:01:20.250> should<00:01:20.490> cycle<00:01:20.909> fairly<00:01:21.270> fast<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> I'm<00:01:23.729> going

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it should cycle fairly fast so I'm going

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.130 
it should cycle fairly fast so I'm going
to<00:01:23.939> set<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.659> we're<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> see

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to set this up and we're going to see

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.249 
to set this up and we're going to see
how<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:27.500> okay<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:30.259> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
how it's going okay so you can see this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
how it's going okay so you can see this
with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.759> stuff<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> bottom

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
with the really good stuff on the bottom

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
with the really good stuff on the bottom
the<00:01:33.750> stuff<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.200> been<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the stuff that's been in there for a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:51.730 
the stuff that's been in there for a
week<00:01:34.979> or<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.759> top<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:38.790> die<00:01:39.030> primed<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.380 

something<00:01:52.550> isn't<00:01:52.730> hooked<00:01:53.090> up<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:55.390> so

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
something isn't hooked up right so

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.450 
something isn't hooked up right so
little<00:01:56.810> air<00:01:57.050> bubble<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.620> back<00:01:57.830> there<00:01:58.130> you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
little air bubble in the back there you

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.760 
little air bubble in the back there you
can<00:01:58.670> hear<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.030> kind<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.570> spittin

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.610 

that'll<00:02:07.460> clear<00:02:07.640> out<00:02:07.940> what<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.350> doing<00:02:09.619> is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
that'll clear out what that is doing is

to go in there now one thing I may do is
just<00:02:47.660> stir<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.590> gravel<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> little<00:02:49.459> bit

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
just stir up the gravel a little bit

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.370 
just stir up the gravel a little bit
just<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.600> get<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:53.570> just<00:02:54.200> to
