 in the first game in the first leg to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.590
 We do not by 1-0 the milan team that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.570
 I'm using the other and find you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 cap team who is chelsea 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 we will do this starting now 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.820
 and the capital with a very naughty 4212 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.340
 they play the sketch of a 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.270
 right on this stage in Chile and the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 square 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.750
 the style of play of which is very similar 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.119
 with ours he likes to keep possession 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.979
 he likes to spin the game he 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.530
 likes to go there so play with him is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.210
 always very cool games are very 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 cool people tried to do nothing much 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.710
 abusive people try not to keep trying 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 play just to win we tried 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.900
 play with one beautiful playing and if you can 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.490
 see what I was at the goal attempted a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.840
 touch coverage and maybe make a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.229
 play a little more with the people we talk 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.509
 We suggest that then we will work 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.340
 ball and with the pack entered the vacancy of 21 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.770
 minutes the cap is having difficulty 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 take the ball from us arrived deserves of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 back in the boaventura we try still 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 an out- of-area finish but was 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.070
 very very very bad was not good 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 This play is very classic when 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 I'm very close to the time to hit the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.780
 lack I think I will not get 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.149
 ladinho robot to see if I can get the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.280
 kick closer to the goal the goalkeeper him 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.350
 managed to intercept but look at this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.100
 short took the marking pedalou 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.729
 pressing the ground and 2 to 0 it there 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.950
 guys 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.649
 2 to 0 the first match of the leg was 1 to 0 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.380
 for you get the mark of 39 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.660
 minutes 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.860
 this very important little bit to give 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.530
 tranquility for us people 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.590
 able to turn the first time yet 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.240
 winning is a very important step in 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 search of the people to win the challenge 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.470
 We can steal this ball in the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.270
 44-minute mark but then a source 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.020
 clothes back to throw a ball 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.960
 perfect and I said before that left 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.480
 on the ground leaves the ground crazy loses the goal more 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.650
 in the rebound the cab gets the tie I 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 told us to get the second half 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.070
 achieving in this score of 2 to 0 in the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.780
 score added to people was very 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.170
 close to achieving more with the second 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.570
 whether you have to keep an eye're 2 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
 to 1 on the aggregate score very important 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.740
 that we do not stay in the cameras that the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.920
 Guys do not make a fool of getting smart. 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.530
 because he plays very well and his victory is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.230
 still possible to finish the first half 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.970
 with more ball possession and more rare kick 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.200
 even the games that I have a way 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.200
 Generally I get a little more 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.700
 possession but he had many 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.380
 chances in the first time the child 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.140
 second was to adjust me but look that 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.670
 play from your team took everyone but 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.280
 and then he went after unintentionally and so 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.200
 It was very difficult for us to get 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.210
 area of â€‹â€‹the other time of glory the people 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.740
 playing it also took playing but 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.590
 It's very difficult sometimes we have 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.930
 up there until the square kicks out of the area 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.270
 and in this move of the Chilean cap it 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.340
 get a good dribble but we 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.290
 also behind closed is that 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.209
 province of farah in the area and has no 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.190
 very lucky that they can with bike already 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.810
 in the 90 minutes they did not have many 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.060
 chances in the second half the game was 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.520
 really well balanced none of the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.230
 players had a lot of time only 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.110
 space to achieve something more 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
 important I tried to close the file with 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.010
 My player decided to put his foot in the ball. 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.260
 And that's it, guys, the end of the first 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.850
 We challenge people to earn OPEC by 2 to 1 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.130
 on the aggregate score it will make me 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.959
 wrong be sure to pass a car 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.060
 break to check the path series 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.800
 does not leave the pilot also the first 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.590
 first match of Spain had its 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.510
 first match in the real but finally this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.190
 there it does not give you a fan what the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.049
 people have a notion if you liked or 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.669
 Not in content, that's it, people do not 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.960
 is in the car worked here 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.960
 that hug said
