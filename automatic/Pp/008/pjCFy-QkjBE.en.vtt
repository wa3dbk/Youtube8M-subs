00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.579
 never talked to economists 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.970
 It's a waste of time 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.089
 I'll make an exception with you for you seems to add economist kutcher 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.400
 Actually, I'm not the rules. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.490
 I speak and it is that he listens to you 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.190
 there will be no questions 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.580
 I do not know your case but understand this 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.800
 there is only one case 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 they are a situation 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 so you will not have to waste full time 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760
 if you pay attention to our channel 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 the paths to the rules and we'll be quick 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 regulation 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 who wants then 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 the saler 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.480
 8 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.689
 'I'm looking forward to you' come back with tomato I want tomatoes that have good 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.400
 what do we do 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.510
 an exchange 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 a simple exchange for example the new one for each take 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.640
 that's how things were at the beginning 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
 but of course sometimes your tomatoes from the best worst times 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 or maybe I want to buy a horse and I do not know how many eggs 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 I need 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 but if we are as a reference for example is a simple example a bit of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 gold 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 by last 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.939
 villa and it's not too much 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.340
 is valuable 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.930
 so we can do a conversion run if a dozen eggs 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.900
 worth the same as a gold nugget and a horse costs synthetic easy to know 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.060
 that a horse is worth the same as me 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.279
 we wanted simple goal mistakes 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.459
 gold thus becomes a bargaining chip 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 to simplify 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.239
 efe can no longer buy a horse the rest also in the villages by 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.239
 coins needed a goal in favor 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.999
 with this plan 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.539
 That is the first step 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.969
 everything is more or less the same as the beginning 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.260
 it's something we now need just to buy the things that we drive 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.259
 lecce meat 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.879
 the person who invented the system has an establishment 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.879
 a place where what we want was stored 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.699
 the man the actress clarified they do not want to give us the gold was enough for 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.199
 lend it to us 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.309
 for example serving 10 coins 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.309
 they are borrowed for a period of 12 months 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.269
 just ask a reasonable interest logic put the child 10% 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.680
 yes he risks his roll did not risk anything so he needs a 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.789
 guarantee to cover the possibility that I no longer fulfill my part of the path 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.269
 Would you mind hitting those knives more? 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.269
 they are for juice 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.469
 in your case if you also want gold you will mortgage luck 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.959
 so the man preceded him 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.819
 in exchange for their templates 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.969
 2 is followed with its tomatoes and green areas 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.019
 you do not have to undo anything and that's why the referee 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.719
 you only have to return to the bank a cost coins after a year so it is 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.639
 that they lent him 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.009
 women 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.349
 I keep your products dead and you have a whole year 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.139
 only if he does not meet the bank he keeps the game 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.389
 the agreement 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.049
 He has problems 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.049
 in July 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.999
 imagine that the bank owns a total amount of dirham os 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.370
 which is the total amount of gold that exists 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.370
 time ago 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.210
 besides the good man we exist other 10 people 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.900
 a network or maybe a couple of ranchers 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 a seamstress 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.909
 ten people in total 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.349
 we all need gold to buy titles we have asked for a loan 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.189
 10 coins for each 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.189
 a total of 100 megabytes 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.969
 they get lost 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.419
 the banker has given us all his savings 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.129
 with absolute generosity 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.499
 And in exchange for what 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.849
 a simple 10% 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.849
 one coin per person 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.279
 But that is 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.120
 According to Pythagoras we have a problem 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.190
 if after twelve months we have to pay 11 coins each 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.360
 while we are going to take out 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.300
 ponce coins each are 110 coins that means there are 10 coins in 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.050
 interests 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.529
 that they will never be able to stop 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.529
 petalotis 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.789
 no problem 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.460
 the bank was invented to make things easier to complicate 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.680
 there is a reasonable solution 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.680
 save me only interest one coin every second 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.599
 next year 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.599
 You already told me will be the amount initially borrowed 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.819
 the first 10 coins in short 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.990
 but nevertheless 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.240
 however if we return a coin we will have nine 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.869
 the truth to 1 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.189
 so if still 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.499
 we must foot coins 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:49.499
 some year we will continue with the same problem and also 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.469
 we have less money 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.580
 some coins less than the previous year 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.340
 if we repeat the operation for ten years and that always stops paying us 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.919
 only the interest 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:01.940
 at that time 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.839
 we are left with nothing 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:06.159
 all the money disappeared 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.300
 however, we will continue to have this province 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.129
 the bank will have recovered all the gold 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:14.379
 we will not have anything 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.050
 and we will still owe what they lent us the beginning 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.759
 100 coins among all 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.759
 that we can never return because simply 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.469
 so we will have the lands 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:36.249
 animals the food that we protect as a guarantee the principle 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.039
 ten years ago 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.889
 in ten years the bank will have what it had at the beginning plus all our 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:42.919
 possessions 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:44.770
 we will not have anything 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.210
 absolutely nothing 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.659
 with what in practice 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:50.110
 we will have become slaves of the bank 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.460
 and because 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.529
 and for nothing
