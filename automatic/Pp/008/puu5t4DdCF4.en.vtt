using too much of it or my hair was a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.850 
using too much of it or my hair was a
wet<00:04:48.330> map<00:04:48.570> because<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.870> does<00:04:49.050> say<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.409> applying

wet map because it does say it applying
soaking<00:04:50.400> wet<00:04:50.580> hair<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:52.260> yeah<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.710> was<00:04:52.860> flaking

like that I didn't use a leave-in the
first<00:04:54.780> time<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.889> my<00:04:56.070> third<00:04:56.940> time<00:04:56.970> using

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
feel like it's flaking but not as bad

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.820 
feel like it's flaking but not as bad
like<00:05:02.789> you<00:05:02.820> can<00:05:03.030> see<00:05:03.270> some<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.289> spots<00:05:04.560> are

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
like you can see some of the spots are

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.159 
like you can see some of the spots are
either<00:05:05.030> wet<00:05:06.030> or<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:06.510> can<00:05:06.659> start<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.990> see<00:05:07.139> it

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169

either wet or you can start to see it
starting<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.740> flake<00:05:07.949> so<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:08.970> don't<00:05:09.240> know<00:05:09.300> I

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
starting to flake so I don't know I

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.850 
starting to flake so I don't know I
never<00:05:09.570> read<00:05:09.930> some<00:05:10.169> reviews<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.560> lot<00:05:10.650> of<00:05:10.770> people

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
never read some reviews a lot of people

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.469 
never read some reviews a lot of people
haven't<00:05:11.250> say<00:05:11.460> anything<00:05:11.729> experienced<00:05:12.240> flaking

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.110 
haven't say anything experienced flaking
with<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.110> don't<00:05:13.289> know<00:05:13.440> what<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:14.060> but<00:05:15.060> I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
with it so I don't know what it is but I

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.510 
with it so I don't know what it is but I
am<00:05:15.389> experiencing<00:05:16.169> flaking<00:05:16.500> with<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:17.010> when<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
am experiencing flaking with it when the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.300 
am experiencing flaking with it when the
bottle<00:05:17.849> it<00:05:17.970> says<00:05:18.000> um<00:05:18.860> for<00:05:19.860> additional

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
bottle it says um for additional

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.399 
bottle it says um for additional
moisture<00:05:20.460> curl<00:05:20.970> definition<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.690> apply<00:05:21.990> their

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
moisture curl definition to apply their

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.330 
moisture curl definition to apply their
hair<00:05:23.280> lotion<00:05:23.789> or<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.900> curl<00:05:25.560> activator<00:05:25.740> as<00:05:26.310> a

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
hair lotion or the curl activator as a

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.490 
hair lotion or the curl activator as a
leave-in<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.150> maybe<00:05:27.389> I'm<00:05:28.020> guessing<00:05:28.409> that

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
leave-in so maybe I'm guessing that

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.170 
leave-in so maybe I'm guessing that
maybe<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.039> might<00:05:29.280> be<00:05:29.430> contributing<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:30.030> why

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
maybe that might be contributing to why

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.710 
maybe that might be contributing to why
we<00:05:30.690> are<00:05:30.720> experiencing<00:05:31.620> flaking<00:05:31.889> um<00:05:32.720> I'm

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.240 
we are experiencing flaking um I'm
assuming<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.139> you<00:05:34.289> have<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.620> use<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:35.039> their

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
assuming that you have to use all their

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.520 
assuming that you have to use all their
products<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.729> conjunction<00:05:36.060> with<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.780> but<00:05:37.500> I

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
products in conjunction with this but I

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
did not do that

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.520 
did not do that
so<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:39.449> so<00:05:39.599> overall<00:05:39.930> are<00:05:40.169> they<00:05:40.289> like<00:05:40.409> the
