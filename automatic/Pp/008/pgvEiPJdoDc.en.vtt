to<00:01:30.240> throw<00:01:30.360> accurate<00:01:30.960> passes<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> remember<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
to throw accurate passes so remember the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.940 
to throw accurate passes so remember the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
more you practice the easier you'll find

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it at this distance you'll also probably

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
it at this distance you'll also probably
need<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> step<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> pass<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.700> generate

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
need to step into the pass to generate

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
need to step into the pass to generate
enough<00:01:39.360> power<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> pass<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.560> carry<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
your partner make sure you practice

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.600 
your partner make sure you practice
stepping<00:01:43.649> forward<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:44.009> both<00:01:44.340> feet

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
arm also you'll need to throw passes
