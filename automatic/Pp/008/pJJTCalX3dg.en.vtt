00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
recovery was worse than these maybe than

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.750 
recovery was worse than these maybe than
the<00:01:06.420> burn<00:01:06.570> itself<00:01:06.930> no<00:01:07.740> certainly<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.370> I<00:01:08.610> mean

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the burn itself no certainly was I mean

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.450 
the burn itself no certainly was I mean
when<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.870> burned<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.410> severely<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.220> did

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
when you get burned as severely as I did

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
when you get burned as severely as I did
at<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.480> moment<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> burning<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.560> no

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
at the moment of the burning there's no

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.740 
at the moment of the burning there's no
pain

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
pain

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.840 
pain
I<00:01:14.780> guess<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.280> know<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.700> way

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
I guess that's just you know the way

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.560 
I guess that's just you know the way
your<00:01:17.570> body<00:01:18.080> shutting<00:01:18.560> off<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.420> what<00:01:20.420> is

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
your body shutting off to what is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.810 
your body shutting off to what is
unbearable<00:01:21.230> but<00:01:21.680> later<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.490> becomes

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
unbearable but later it becomes

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.660 
unbearable but later it becomes
unbearable<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.050> then<00:01:24.830> it's<00:01:24.980> that<00:01:25.250> way<00:01:25.460> for

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
unbearable so and then it's that way for

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.990 
unbearable so and then it's that way for
months

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
months

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.780 
months

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
yeah right was there any worry that yeah
