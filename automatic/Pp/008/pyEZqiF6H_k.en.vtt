00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.639
 mister then championship that reopens 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 with this match, according to her it is 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.750
 truly elusive 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 tell us so but we know before 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.689
 game that was an important occasion 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 for us to win to take more 6 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.140
 on the Naples to return to minus 6 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.040
 on the juve then we have exploited 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 this opportunity we have seen in this 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 week that juve is not 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 unbeatable but it's a great team and me 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 I said we don't have our destiny 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.910
 in our feet but we must be 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.739
 ready if the front teams back 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.020
 dear a little and we did this 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.480
 this and this afternoon hold a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.710
 pjanic totti florenzi on the bench come 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.390
 a game in Verona anyway 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.040
 important because it is a competition e 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.360
 probably reopens championship thing 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 it means that the roma really is one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 big rose and she is very good at that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 above all I already said turnover 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 when we have not injured or 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 choices 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 and possible on the important bench 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 because we have seen that all three 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 players who came out nainggolan 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.070
 the right side of the floors there is the year 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.869
 they did really well but it is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.990
 especially when others enter 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:43.439
 come in with jobs like how it is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:46.170
 they had started the race is that one 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.640
 our strength I think a couple of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.350
 weeks ago there was benitez 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.569
 in his place we asked him to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.789
 giorgino and he told us I didn't see him 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.060
 giorgi left after two days 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.690
 I ask her to take offense today she saw it is a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.119
 player that she likes but I think in 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.580
 all Italy that there is no disturbance a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.740
 strong player but and of the verona 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.690
 nothing else to say the latest 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 what if it tells me something about rigor like 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.280
 I saw she did not see it I can not 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.510
 say nothing but 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.790
 I know I know I know that rigor has arrived 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.520
 on 2 1 already out of boredom and for me it doesn't change 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.400
 nothing on 2 1 we won the wind 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.260
 in the same way 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.220
 something about the first time it seemed 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.319
 the return of the start of the championship 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.510
 when the first time on the ancestors 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.450
 the second theme reported to the opponent 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.540
 it happened it is happening like this again 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.459
 in the last one, however, I don't think I don't think 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.010
 I didn't like my team on 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.390
 first half but on the second half yes 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.550
 we really did great 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.140
 second half minus the goal because we have 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.080
 got a goal in the second half we have 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.880
 made mistakes on this goal but on 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.819
 second time we played a lot more 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.530
 much simpler fast with a lot more 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.510
 movements 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.480
 that's what I want to see from the beginning 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.550
 although we know that playing here at 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.709
 Verona is always difficult for them to do 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.650
 almost all their points at home but 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.230
 even though they played very defensive e 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700
 they put the game a bit first 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.860
 time on the physical plane 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.000
 we have to do much better a lot 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.080
 best we did in the first half 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.140
 mister emiliano and cervino that that she is 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.810
 memories i know so well but him 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.610
 it's a good time he scored against the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.910
 Juve has scored today and above all has 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.880
 made the sea ​​on the first goal but i 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.790
 but he can still improve 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.380
 what matters that the estimate of all 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.010
 his companions then the michele trust 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.290
 from the important team because he he 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.390
 so can can play his game his 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.260
 game and aim the jumping opponent 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:14.510
 man exploited in depth and when 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:17.690
 play like this is devastating if good evening 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.180
 Good evening, I wanted to ask this now 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.030
 championship starts in the second part 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.910
 in the decisive phase it is afraid that yes 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.500
 they can poison things from the point of 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 arbitration view yesterday there were 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.640
 controversy at the Olympic in the match with 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.300
 the Lazio in the Italian Cup were there 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.530
 controversy and just got a tweet from 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.780
 reina who says but what rigor they have 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.700
 voted in favor of Rome 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.060
 does not fear that this second part of the 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.700
 arbitrage season can yes 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.300
 year begins to spark controversy over 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.690
 refereeing 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.810
 thank you above all we must leave 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.340
 quiet arbiters that yes because there 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.630
 there are so many people who always scream 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.630
 after a negative result 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.490
 here in italy they are there are 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:14.080
 good damage gives the best in the field 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:17.449
 as miners and players 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.419
 We coaches can misplace 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.139
 player also referees also but 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.699
 that is not 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.889
 the most important thing is the most thing 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.860
 important already I said it is that we and I 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.949
 want or the people who see the game in 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.560
 tv sees the slow motion ten times 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.550
 then the referees have half a second 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.879
 to choose their decision 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:46.189
 we must respect the referees and do 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.189
 so as to help them above all
