install a new paper towel holder but
first<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.519> discuss<00:00:09.000> about<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
first I'm going to discuss about the

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.919 
first I'm going to discuss about the
variety<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.580> paper<00:00:11.940> towel<00:00:12.240> holders<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.870> are

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
variety of paper towel holders that are

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.160 
variety of paper towel holders that are
available<00:00:13.290> today<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.880> that's<00:00:15.660> actually

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
available today and that's actually

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.310 
available today and that's actually
probably<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.619> hardest<00:00:16.949> part<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> job<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
probably the hardest part of the job is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.939 
probably the hardest part of the job is
picking<00:00:19.320> out<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> one<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.609> best<00:00:20.880> suits<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
picking out the one that best suits you

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.820 
picking out the one that best suits you
this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.279> example<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.960> plastic<00:00:25.439> model

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this is an example of the plastic model

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
this is an example of the plastic model
and<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.849> has<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> advantage<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.599> being

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and it has the advantage of being

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.609 
and it has the advantage of being
economical<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> has<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> disadvantage<00:00:30.619> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
economical but it has a disadvantage it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.500 
economical but it has a disadvantage it
may<00:00:31.859> eventually<00:00:32.219> break<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:33.030> mine<00:00:33.270> did

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
may eventually break like mine did

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.340 
may eventually break like mine did
that's<00:00:34.380> why<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.880> replace<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.989> selected

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that's why to replace it I have selected

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.310 
that's why to replace it I have selected
a<00:00:37.649> stainless<00:00:38.100> steel<00:00:38.129> model<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.780> select<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a stainless steel model and I select the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.360 
a stainless steel model and I select the
one<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.760> doesn't<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.600> hinges<00:00:43.370> so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
one that actually doesn't have hinges so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
one that actually doesn't have hinges so
there's<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> chance<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
there's not going to be a chance of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
there's not going to be a chance of
breaking<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.890> bought<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.760> amazon.com<00:00:48.270> and
