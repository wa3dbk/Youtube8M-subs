and I think they sends how important it
is<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.340> I<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:53.969> been<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.480> tremendous

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
is and I think there's been a tremendous

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.750 
is and I think there's been a tremendous
benefit<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.550> her<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:58.500> being<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
benefit for her in in being in a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.570 
benefit for her in in being in a
community<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.649> she<00:01:01.649> feels<00:01:04.339> it's<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.549> of
