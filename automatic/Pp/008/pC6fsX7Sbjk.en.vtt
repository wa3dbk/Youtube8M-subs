00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.880 
appreciate that if that were true then
you<00:03:28.340> cannot<00:03:28.730> assemble<00:03:29.330> these<00:03:29.810> fragments<00:03:30.470> back

you cannot assemble these fragments back

in time as I've assembly it's a physical

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.150 
fragments as I hope you can all
appreciate<00:05:17.990> this<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.620> where<00:05:18.770> they<00:05:18.860> came<00:05:19.100> from

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
appreciate this is where they came from

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.709 
appreciate this is where they came from
them

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
them

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.959 
them
they<00:05:19.929> were<00:05:19.989> eroded<00:05:20.589> mechanically<00:05:21.369> eroded<00:05:21.819> and

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
they were eroded mechanically eroded and

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.119 
they were eroded mechanically eroded and
been<00:05:22.389> washed<00:05:23.049> down<00:05:23.289> the<00:05:23.319> rivers<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
been washed down the rivers and

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.369 
been washed down the rivers and
deposited<00:05:24.759> in<00:05:25.029> these<00:05:25.239> sedimentary<00:05:25.899> basins

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
deposited in these sedimentary basins

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.809 
deposited in these sedimentary basins
it's<00:05:26.709> all<00:05:26.860> you're<00:05:27.009> doing<00:05:27.219> moving<00:05:27.459> back<00:05:27.669> in

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
it's all you're doing moving back in

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.609 
it's all you're doing moving back in
time<00:05:27.999> is<00:05:28.089> just<00:05:28.239> simply<00:05:28.539> returning<00:05:29.019> them<00:05:29.110> back

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
time is just simply returning them back

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.439 
time is just simply returning them back
to<00:05:29.769> where<00:05:29.889> they<00:05:30.009> came<00:05:30.219> from<00:05:30.279> and<00:05:30.849> similarly

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
to where they came from and similarly

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.999 
to where they came from and similarly
the<00:05:31.599> volcanic<00:05:31.929> rocks<00:05:32.259> they<00:05:32.439> come<00:05:32.649> from<00:05:32.860> the

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
the volcanic rocks they come from the

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.679 
the volcanic rocks they come from the
mantle<00:05:33.369> so<00:05:33.579> you<00:05:33.639> just<00:05:33.849> simply<00:05:34.029> return<00:05:34.509> them<00:05:34.659> to

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 
mantle so you just simply return them to

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.239 
mantle so you just simply return them to
the<00:05:34.869> mantle<00:05:35.229> and<00:05:35.379> the<00:05:35.529> Granite's<00:05:35.889> and<00:05:36.159> the

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:36.249 
the mantle and the Granite's and the

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.819 
the mantle and the Granite's and the
water<00:05:36.459> and<00:05:36.759> so<00:05:36.939> on<00:05:38.099> these<00:05:40.289> what's<00:05:41.289> left

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:41.829 
water and so on these what's left

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.009 
water and so on these what's left
these<00:05:42.399> crustal<00:05:43.059> fragments<00:05:43.449> are<00:05:43.569> watch<00:05:43.719> left

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:44.019 
these crustal fragments are watch left

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:47.309 
these crustal fragments are watch left
and<00:05:44.589> as<00:05:45.549> I<00:05:45.610> was<00:05:46.029> alluding<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:46.689> before<00:05:46.839> on<00:05:47.289> a

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
and as I was alluding to before on a

and as I was alluding to before on a
plate<00:05:47.589> tectonic<00:05:48.099> scenario<00:05:49.139> this<00:05:50.139> would<00:05:50.379> be<00:05:50.589> an

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:50.679 
plate tectonic scenario this would be an

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:53.699 
plate tectonic scenario this would be an
impossible<00:05:51.219> situation<00:05:51.659> where<00:05:52.659> these<00:05:53.349> same

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:53.709 
impossible situation where these same

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:56.059 
impossible situation where these same

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.469

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
plate tectonic people do not use this

plate tectonic people do not use this
oceanic<00:06:12.059> mapping<00:06:13.259> so<00:06:14.259> they<00:06:15.039> cannot<00:06:15.369> get<00:06:15.669> to

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
oceanic mapping so they cannot get to

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.769 
oceanic mapping so they cannot get to

an outline of the location of the
present-day<00:06:29.289> continents<00:06:30.039> which<00:06:30.159> you<00:06:30.339> won't

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:30.519 
present-day continents which you won't

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.699 
present-day continents which you won't
be<00:06:30.639> able<00:06:30.729> to<00:06:30.849> see<00:06:31.149> but<00:06:31.539> just<00:06:31.839> flashed<00:06:32.110> past<00:06:32.439> but

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:32.709 
be able to see but just flashed past but

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.159 
be able to see but just flashed past but
was<00:06:32.800> Antarctica<00:06:33.489> Greenland<00:06:34.089> and<00:06:34.629> Hudson<00:06:35.079> Bay

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
was Antarctica Greenland and Hudson Bay

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.009 
was Antarctica Greenland and Hudson Bay
so<00:06:35.349> that's<00:06:35.499> America<00:06:36.389> is<00:06:37.389> trying<00:06:37.659> to<00:06:37.809> sneak

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.019 
so that's America is trying to sneak

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:40.409 
so that's America is trying to sneak
down<00:06:38.409> the<00:06:38.559> side<00:06:38.769> in<00:06:38.949> so<00:06:39.189> America<00:06:39.789> and

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
down the side in so America and

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.649 
down the side in so America and
Australia<00:06:40.809> is<00:06:41.110> tucked<00:06:41.409> in<00:06:41.559> there

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
Australia is tucked in there

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.399 
Australia is tucked in there
Antarctica<00:06:43.829> India<00:06:44.829> etc
