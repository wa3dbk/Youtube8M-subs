open<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.469> piece<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> one<00:00:53.879> piece

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
open it up this piece here is one piece

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.410 
open it up this piece here is one piece
and<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:56.190> rest<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.969> wraps<00:00:57.210> around

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and the rest of this just wraps around

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
and the rest of this just wraps around
there<00:00:58.370> but<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.960> three<00:01:00.960> clips<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there but there are three clips on one

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.490 
there but there are three clips on one
side<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.579> two<00:01:02.940> clips<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.719> that's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
side and two clips on the other that's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
side and two clips on the other that's
basically<00:01:05.010> what's<00:01:05.250> holding<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> together

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
basically what's holding it together

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.170 
basically what's holding it together
the<00:01:06.869> tops<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> bottom<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> ones<00:01:09.119> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the tops on the bottom are the ones that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.750 
the tops on the bottom are the ones that
are<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> hardest<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.290> remove<00:01:10.760> approach'

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
are the hardest to remove approach'

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.260 
are the hardest to remove approach'
unclip<00:01:12.360> aside<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.939> once<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> get

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
unclip aside from that once you get

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.609 
unclip aside from that once you get
those<00:01:16.200> five<00:01:16.799> Clips<00:01:17.479> loose<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:19.320> you'll<00:01:19.500> be

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
those five Clips loose then you'll be

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
those five Clips loose then you'll be
able<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.950> remove<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> drive<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.210> let's<00:01:21.630> go

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
able to remove the drive so let's go

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.750 
able to remove the drive so let's go
ahead<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> start<00:01:22.500> working<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
ahead and start working on it

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760 
ahead and start working on it
so<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.840> what<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:25.990> understand<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.530> can<00:01:26.650> just

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
so for what I understand you can just

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.010 
so for what I understand you can just
pry<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:27.190> off<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:28.390> I'm<00:01:28.450> just<00:01:28.630> hoping<00:01:28.780> my

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
pry this off so I'm just hoping my

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.610 
pry this off so I'm just hoping my

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
mostly rubber on the one side I'm hoping

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.039 
mostly rubber on the one side I'm hoping
that<00:02:47.739> that's<00:02:47.890> not<00:02:48.040> going<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> scratch<00:02:51.269> okay<00:02:52.269> in

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
that that's not going to scratch okay in

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.100 
that that's not going to scratch okay in
case<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.349> decide<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.680> use<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.930> external<00:02:55.930> case

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
case I decide to use that external case

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.479 
case I decide to use that external case
again<00:02:57.269> let's<00:02:58.269> go<00:02:58.480> ahead<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.989> try<00:02:59.890> they<00:03:00.069> loosen

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
again let's go ahead and try they loosen

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.430 
again let's go ahead and try they loosen
up<00:03:00.580> as<00:03:00.700> much<00:03:00.879> as<00:03:01.030> they<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:02.019> think

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
up as much as they can here I think

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.319 
up as much as they can here I think
that's<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.799> for<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.130> side<00:03:03.430> I'll<00:03:04.090> try<00:03:04.269> the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
that's it for this side I'll try the

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:24.070 
that's it for this side I'll try the
other<00:03:04.480> side<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:08.440> if<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.069> same<00:03:09.599> luck

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.119 

that's<00:03:24.740> right<00:03:25.180> there<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.240> go

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.610 

look<00:03:30.129> at<00:03:30.219> that<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.319> a<00:03:32.379> much<00:03:32.590> shorter

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
look at that this is a much shorter

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.830 
look at that this is a much shorter
video<00:03:33.310> than<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.819> lot<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.180> people<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.629> see

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
video than a lot of people that I see

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.369 
video than a lot of people that I see
online<00:03:35.260> then<00:03:36.060> I've<00:03:37.060> already<00:03:37.959> gotten<00:03:38.140> an

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
online then I've already gotten an

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.530 
online then I've already gotten an
opening<00:03:38.769> with<00:03:38.859> long<00:03:39.040> tool<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.670> lot<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.329> people

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
opening with long tool a lot of people

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.420 
opening with long tool a lot of people
seem<00:03:40.719> to<00:03:40.810> be<00:03:40.930> struggling<00:03:41.170> with<00:03:41.469> it<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.829> I'm

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
seem to be struggling with it and I'm

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.059 
seem to be struggling with it and I'm
not<00:03:42.609> saying<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:42.939> I'm<00:03:43.569> a<00:03:43.629> pro<00:03:43.900> with<00:03:44.079> this<00:03:44.230> but

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
not saying that I'm a pro with this but
