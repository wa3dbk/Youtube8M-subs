00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'll show you a new video today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.000
 ice cream sandwich on the htc sensation 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.830
 and we unlock it first 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 Let's go to settings and in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 the phone info if you look 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 software information we can sound 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.699
 Seeing that it is Android 4.0.1 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.679
 with the htc sense version 3.5 has something 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.489
 has changed 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.670
 first down here bar you can 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.329
 now do the eps individually sorry 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 if you look someone then we have there 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.930
 market there we can put such folder in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 refer to the individual and to a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 others do when open it then come there 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.969
 the apps are displayed so if we have that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 to lock all 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.480
 make noisy then here are quite normal 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.299
 the applications you get in the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.049
 Quick selection, you have the whole then 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.119
 can pull ring 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.799
 but then you can stop there too 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.640
 Create a folder underneath 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 what goes of course is among the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.659
 apps do not work that out 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.159
 is still going up and down 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.250
 later it goes to the left and to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.250
 right 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.650
 what you can still adjust is the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.390
 Facial unlocking under security there 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 you could then lock the form below 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.930
 Set face lock and yourself 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 set up 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.040
 then we come to the under 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.630
 proper center here we have now in 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.869
 moment, no notifications 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.869
 in it 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.880
 but if we have short settings here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.840
 then we'll see about that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.649
 wireless connection and below mobile 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.600
 network wlan and bluetooth save our 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.140
 flight mode and the normal day 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 Manager 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.740
 My feeling has this rom I currently 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.850
 have a little more memory for 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.850
 disposal where to go to settings 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.620
 and a mobile network 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.900
 not much has changed 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.610
 if you use it that it is 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:48.420
 new one can already here its all 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 mobile data the one about the mobile 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.900
 net has nice manage and manage 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 unlock 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.770
 depending on how much you already consumed 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.770
 have the data roaming 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.720
 so now I show something quite cool 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:16.750
 let's go to all the apps then we go 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.750
 on it and then we are looking for notes 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:31.000
 go on and then we'll try 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.000
 just the language input down here 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.040
 This is a test note 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.620
 a text note 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:03.319
 I'm just testing the language input 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:07.450
 android point that works pretty well 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.450
 well let's see how it goes on 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.090
 As you can see, that works quite well 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.190
 and that takes a sometimes already 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.290
 a lot of work off if you like something 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.300
 has to write and quickly just per 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.300
 want to say input 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.490
 which, of course, is also possible, for example 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.480
 drive cologne 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.240
 that must be 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.240
 accept 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:27.050
 and then we would also cologne to control 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.220
 by gps what, of course, it is synonymous 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.890
 example sender a sms 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.890
 I'll come later today 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.030
 I'll come later that's great 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.129
 then you can work up here 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.349
 can still choose names synonymous 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:57.659
 say but that understands some 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:06:02.190
 unfortunately not yet but otherwise it was 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:05.569
 even the basic material and we see 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.569
 us then in the next video
