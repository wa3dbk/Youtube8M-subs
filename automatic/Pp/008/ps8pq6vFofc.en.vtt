drawing of a frozen palm tree and then I

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.890 
drawing of a frozen palm tree and then I
made<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:47.890> drawing<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.909> melted<00:01:49.330> palm<00:01:49.570> tree

made this drawing of a melted palm tree

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.560 
made this drawing of a melted palm tree
bed<00:01:50.170> look<00:01:50.409> see<00:01:50.620> we<00:01:51.190> did<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.120> I<00:01:52.150> put<00:01:52.420> those

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
bed look see we did it so I put those

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.080 
bed look see we did it so I put those
ideas<00:01:52.870> together<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.830> your<00:01:54.400> idea<00:01:54.729> about<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
ideas together with your idea about the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.030 
ideas together with your idea about the
weather<00:01:55.270> factory<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.050> then<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.409> scientists

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
weather factory and then the scientists

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.530 
weather factory and then the scientists
idea<00:01:57.400> about<00:01:57.670> being<00:01:57.940> able<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.150> control<00:01:58.300> the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
idea about being able to control the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.510 
idea about being able to control the
climate<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.470> they<00:01:59.620> eventually<00:01:59.830> turned<00:02:00.250> into

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
climate and they eventually turned into

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.190 
climate and they eventually turned into
what<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:04.000> different<00:02:04.180> from<00:02:04.510> any<00:02:04.870> of<00:02:05.080> you

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
what is really different from any of you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.910 
what is really different from any of you
have<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.500> bubs

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
have it bubs

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.830 
have it bubs
it's<00:02:06.130> like<00:02:06.280> there's<00:02:06.549> no<00:02:06.640> bed<00:02:07.060> right<00:02:07.390> movies

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's like there's no bed right movies

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's like there's no bed right movies

like<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> perfect<00:02:36.519> fit<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.209> mean<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.230> hard

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
like the perfect fit I mean it's hard

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.530

it's a story about a man who tries to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.229 
it's a story about a man who tries to
control<00:02:41.019> nature<00:02:41.590> because<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:42.730> got<00:02:42.849> no<00:02:42.879> words

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
control nature because it's got no words

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.759 
control nature because it's got no words
in<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.540> people<00:02:43.870> from<00:02:44.049> all<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.319> ages<00:02:44.650> and
