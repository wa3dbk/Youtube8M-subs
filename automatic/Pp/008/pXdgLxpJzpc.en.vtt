00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.910
 the dakar is the hardest race of the 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.190
 world for cars for pilots and also 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.050
 for the whole group that you surround here like this 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.240
 that we take the experience of the year 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.310
 past with the duster that we think is not 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.520
 it was fine of course we saw that it was 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.700
 possible of improved and with the support 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.840
 technician who gave us reindeer and also with 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.180
 new advisors we had for this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.309
 year like tito pérez apart from seeing 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.340
 that made us an improvement in the engines 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.750
 we also work with gustavo penín that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.050
 we work a lot in the peripherals of the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.320
 engine and we achieved a lot of power 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.680
 we improve almost 47 horses of the 4 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.379
 thousand 800 laps at 5500 and in a 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.940
 average of 35 horsepower in 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.830
 the wheel we improve this year in the place 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.559
 the car that is 15 horses more what 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.600
 We wanted to improve by optimizing 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.170
 what air filtration has to do 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.970
 not without ceasing to focus on that which is 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.580
 very important for the durability of 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.040
 engine in the car we lose 150 kilos of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.020
 weight that is very much and we are the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.780
 regulation limit since we use a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.100
 6-cylinder engine 3.5 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 it's not easy to carry that weight and what 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 we also achieve 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 very much in logistics because it is a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.240
 career that logistics there is also 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.590
 much of this year's competition 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 we are going to have many more vehicles 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.509
 of assistance we have also contracted 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 the service of a race truck 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.500
 epsilon which is the best provider of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.149
 services of this type of vehicle 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 career is really what that does 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.789
 truck with a pilot and a navigator 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.539
 expert is to take the spare parts to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.539
 to continue in the race 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.750
 apart we will also have with 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.190
 compared to last year more trucks 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.740
 assistance we have two vehicles of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.490
 assists more and with all that what 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.490
 we want to try 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.709
 not a race of 14 stages but 14 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 racing in that is what we work 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.939
 mentalizing our to our group of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.159
 mechanics, not every day there is a 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.750
 new career and we are sure we are 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.549
 much better prepared for this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.310
 dakar so good we hope that the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.170
 things go as planned and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.430
 good and be able to finish with a better 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 result what can happen to us
