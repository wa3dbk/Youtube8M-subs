00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 he wandered very hard at the effort he 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.819
 can go ahead he knows how to do it all 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.720
 this as well for a stamp but hey there 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.090
 I still had a first chance 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
 so I did not want to miss it 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.150
 now he has won really easy 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.019
 you know by heart now he 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 continues to progress 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 yeah and then I find they do the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.890
 much better races than before what he 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.279
 there is less tense so it's very 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.320
 important 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.000
 it is exceptional but grove it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.500
 was coming back to what I saw 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 when I had my three choices agree 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 weave good wagon because bolt is not going 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.500
 serious and billy either what they have in 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.000
 head of two they will burn so 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.950
 so here are the two what state of mind 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 there because after three the test of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.989
 first three places of a group on 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 was still 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.649
 it's crazy yeah it never happens to me 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.790
 arrived day made it a first or 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.110
 second 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 a boarding school does if I can help my 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.590
 proofs and 2nd 3rd it's great anyway 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.420
 bolt that confirms his supremacy 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.730
 it's a phenomenon it's a choice I 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 put a ride like that too cool the ua 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 before he knows how to do everything and my faith he 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.260
 is not yet fully finally I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.040
 not even if it came out I believe that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.830
 I do not like what led to 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.630
 it is a hanger also associates 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.739
 superb yeah because you aboard the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.600
 proto came back a little on them on the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 horse but wildlife and I think I 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.210
 have had better a month ago price day 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 of america they were more 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.940
 sharp to the twins were passed 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.350
 a bit of shape at the shoulder a bit stitched 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 so here are my classes great when 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.450
 not even legal it's you are everything 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 still young to be the horse of life 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 that's for sure it's the belleville horse 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.900
 that's it it's obligatory maybe it's 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.400
 the horse can be the horse of the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 decade of the next decade 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.990
 it's really finally I have not all the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.369
 world has seen what is exceptional there the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 result up 4 it's still 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.340
 not bad it was elastic 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.490
 today so for the old ones it was 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.710
 impossible mission but he knew it 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 already in November in the month of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.920
 December Sebastian told me that aladdin 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.149
 could not make it 25 meters so 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.400
 we are still a little bit 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.970
 a little quiet my asset we have 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.280
 always afraid 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.330
 something happens and then 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.160
 champions like that we do not want 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.620
 whether they be beaten when 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.630
 I was little I still remember 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.380
 when ourasi did not win this fourth 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 price of america 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.820
 in the summer we were all very very sad 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.670
 and today I would have been very sad 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.830
 that bowl of not win but in any case it 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.869
 did it he did well with tremendously 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 to facilitate how you how lived 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.040
 his races you in the stands that's 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.800
 you seem hard is why I 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.540
 look there it seems to me hard and a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.690
 moment see it's pretty unreal 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 the race had to last lasted two minutes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.450
 and half I feel like it lasts 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.940
 30 seconds 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.940
 this is a dream a dream
