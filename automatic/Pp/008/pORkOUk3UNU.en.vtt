00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.709
 good of all my name is Rami and today I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.749
 I bring a very interesting video in 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.870
 which will explain what are the controls 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:11.879
 alternative to my many people but 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 very much asked me why I take 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.609
 the weapons with the y and not with the x as is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.130
 normal then well that 's because I have 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.170
 the alternative controls efforts in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 this video I will explain the possible 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 advantages that controls may have 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.640
 alternatives on controls 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.059
 normal 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.010
 I personally put less because 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.570
 because they change some buttons and for 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.370
 example when making world bones 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 there is only one button that is 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 I avoid unnecessary cartwheels to 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.970
 the time to do the same bones partner put 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.130
 an example here are the controls 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.350
 normal 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.870
 and that is the unnecessary flip to the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.700
 I mean, I'm with the controls 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.640
 alternative does not happen because there is only one 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.530
 button that is the button to and only serves 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.980
 to do to stick the walls and 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.570
 do the walt bones here I'm going to put 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.290
 the example with the controls 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.290
 alternative 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.190
 as you have seen has left me pretty 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.450
 well I have not done any kind of 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.220
 somersault and that's why it's basically 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.160
 because I take these controls 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.010
 basically because that way he avoided that kind of 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.340
 unnecessary flip with which with the 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.320
 that I can die on many occasions 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.480
 and well here are more examples of why 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.150
 I also use it here the enemy is going to 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.500
 throw an ink and the only way to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.130
 survive would be giving a cartwheel 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.170
 backwards but so on earth 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.840
 position my enemy in the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.270
 sniper and I would take it 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.030
 in their normal mountains instead with the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.280
 alternative controls this is no longer 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.649
 can do with the normals it would give a 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.409
 somersault so I would not be stunned and there I would go 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.869
 towards the enemy in most of the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.490
 song that I've done this is something 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.000
 victorious because the enemy does not 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.069
 expect him to do that then the majority 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 of the times on the ground I win and I'm going to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 show the last small advantage that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.010
 can give us we both beat the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 same time he has the controls 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.930
 normal and I the alternative ones 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.940
 we quickly give him and him to have 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.630
 the normal controls unintentionally 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.569
 by quickly looking for then in that 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.030
 unnecessary return and I have 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.799
 alternative because I give to the do and not 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.500
 I do is bulky and such with what 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.150
 I can kill very easily and good now 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.430
 I'm going to show you how to change the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.019
 controls here as you are watching I can 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.329
 take the object with the X I have the 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.220
 normal controls and to change the 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.170
 where are we going to be options 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.959
 I send 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.750
 and below all it puts control scheme 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.630
 so it will come by default and we give it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.410
 to the right and we change it as 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.150
 alternative 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.750
 now we give the to save 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.260
 we close and how are you going to see there already 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.150
 we can take the objects with the and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.250
 basically I just get 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.990
 these controls to not do this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.660
 turn that necessary at the time of doing 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.460
 same eye bones that I do not want to say for 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.400
 nothing that can be done better world 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.140
 bones simply that it seems to me that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.740
 the scheme of alternative controls 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.930
 because it's been better to do the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.990
 Bones war and edited more before 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.420
 avoid unnecessary cartwheels to the 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.980
 time to do the same and explained 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.780
 the small advantages that we can 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.120
 offer in the alternative controls 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.340
 let's see now a scheme where we 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.220
 shows some of the changes in 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.800
 control buttons normal to control 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.890
 alternative and good I will go naming 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.069
 those in from top to bottom ok 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.890
 run crouched or is to paint in the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.130
 normal control is the button and in the 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.220
 alternative control the button x the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.520
 somersault in normal control is the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.880
 button a in the alternative control is the 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.970
 button x cover or make the world bones 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.190
 in the normal control is the ar button and in 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.500
 the alternative control is also the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.590
 button 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.829
 catch objects like weapons in grenades 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.000
 ammunition and catch the body of the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.880
 enemies as a human shield 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.350
 in the normal control is the x button on the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.270
 alternative control is the button and 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:39.580
 and execute or the view in the view is by 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.750
 example when an ally of ours 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.990
 knock down then we hit the button and we 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.490
 the camera enters the screen towards that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.460
 point is the dejected ally 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.880
 well execute and the view in the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.640
 normal control is the button and and in the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.610
 alternative control is the stick button 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.160
 right and good I think I do not deserve 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.350
 no button those are those four are 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.060
 they change in the lx the yy the right stick 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.060
 well now I would like you to look at the 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:21.860
 alternative control bar 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.139
 and as you can see there is only the button to 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.660
 do to cover or to make wild 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.350
 bones then this is just my opinion 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.230
 ok in my opinion is that control 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.000
 alternative is better to make the hual 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.340
 pons since it only has one button 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.460
 specialized let's say paste the 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.250
 walls or good make equal bones 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.979
 I carry these controls 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.620
 basically for everything that for everything 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:52.320
 I said earlier Because 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.620
 you can be better the white bones 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.249
 and good and those tiny advantages that 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:03.159
 can provide alternative control 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:08.270
 and if I have to say any some 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:11.930
 inconvenience about this this control 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.230
 I would only say one drawback and neither is 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.470
 so important the convenient would be the 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:22.420
 time in which then we take in 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:27.620
 adapt to this control in I say I 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:30.620
 It took me a while to adapt in two days and good 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.870
 that in adapting me let's say regular then 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.889
 take a week to adapt more or 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.569
 less well 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.419
 and I define well 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.809
 when I'm not wrong with any button 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:46.029
 or anything to jump for a week in let's say 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.909
 not wrong 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:52.389
 in controlling it as with control 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.979
 normal is worth so good that 's the 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.929
 only possible inconvenience that I see him 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.860
 but as I said, it's not for nothing 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:01.699
 important 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.789
 in short I have tried to explain the best 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.700
 that I could have the subject of those controls 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:10.169
 alternative 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.169
 and good if you have any doubt 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:16.560
 me of these controls but any 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.900
 Well, you just leave me the 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.270
 comments with this kind of doubt 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.080
 in this same video and well I'll try 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.080
 answer it 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.290
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:32.800
 has helped and well, see you in 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.800
 another video
