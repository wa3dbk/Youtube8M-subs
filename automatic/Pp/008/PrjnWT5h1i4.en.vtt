everything in and then we'll go ahead
and<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> static<00:01:45.180> test<00:01:45.740> ok<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.950> plugged

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and do the static test ok we're plugged

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
and do the static test ok we're plugged
in<00:01:47.369> let's<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:47.880> ahead<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.119> turn<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.780> arm

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
in let's go ahead and turn it on and arm

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.600 
in let's go ahead and turn it on and arm
it<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:49.649> we'll<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.890> ahead<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.100> run<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it and then we'll go ahead and run it up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.830 
it and then we'll go ahead and run it up
and<00:01:50.729> afterwards<00:01:51.240> we'll<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> look<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and afterwards we'll take a look at the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
and afterwards we'll take a look at the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
okay let's go ahead and take a look at

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.900 
okay let's go ahead and take a look at
the<00:02:26.150> numbers<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> want<00:02:26.840> meter<00:02:27.760> okay<00:02:28.760> it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
the numbers on the want meter okay it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.820 
the numbers on the want meter okay it
feels<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.480> ESC<00:02:29.870> barely<00:02:30.200> got<00:02:30.350> warm<00:02:30.620> to

review<00:02:47.780> thoughts<00:02:48.050> with<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.550> some<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
review thoughts with you some of the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
review thoughts with you some of the
things<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> liked<00:02:50.300> about<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.630> CSC<00:02:51.050> is<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
things that I liked about the CSC is the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.990 
things that I liked about the CSC is the
fact<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.830> feels<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.250> be<00:02:52.280> built<00:02:52.610> pretty

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
fact that it feels to be built pretty

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080 
fact that it feels to be built pretty
robust<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:54.680> its<00:02:54.830> 12<00:02:55.130> gauge<00:02:55.340> wire<00:02:55.370> leaves<00:02:55.880> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
robust with its 12 gauge wire leaves and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.120 
robust with its 12 gauge wire leaves and
it's<00:02:56.209> oversized<00:02:56.720> aluminum<00:02:57.230> heatsink<00:02:57.410> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
it's oversized aluminum heatsink this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.890 
it's oversized aluminum heatsink this
ESC<00:02:58.520> can<00:02:58.700> really<00:02:58.940> dish<00:02:59.120> out<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.450> power<00:02:59.660> and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
ESC can really dish out the power and

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.870 
ESC can really dish out the power and
take<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> punishment<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.980> also<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.850> fact

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
take the punishment I also like the fact

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.520 
take the punishment I also like the fact
that<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.300> ESC<00:03:02.720> came<00:03:02.930> with<00:03:03.050> an<00:03:03.170> on/off<00:03:03.500> switch

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
that this ESC came with an on/off switch

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.770 
that this ESC came with an on/off switch
this<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.670> great<00:03:04.880> for<00:03:05.030> powering<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.690> off

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
this is great for powering on and off

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300 
this is great for powering on and off
your<00:03:05.930> receiver<00:03:06.260> especially<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.920> planes<00:03:07.190> and

your receiver especially in planes and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.560 
your receiver especially in planes and
helicopters<00:03:07.430> works<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.120> little<00:03:08.209> bit<00:03:08.420> more

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
helicopters works a little bit more

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.900 
helicopters works a little bit more
difficult<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.020> get<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.470> batteries<00:03:09.890> as<00:03:10.580> for

difficult to get to the batteries as for

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.820 
difficult to get to the batteries as for
the<00:03:11.000> performance<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:11.690> ESC<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.440> throttle

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the performance of this ESC the throttle

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.010 
the performance of this ESC the throttle
range<00:03:12.980> feels<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.640> linear<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.780> throttle

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
range feels very linear and the throttle

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.290 
range feels very linear and the throttle
response<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.560> extremely<00:03:16.070> quick<00:03:16.280> all<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.150> all<00:03:17.270> I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
response is extremely quick all in all I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.699 
response is extremely quick all in all I
have<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.660> say<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.840> was<00:03:18.050> very<00:03:18.200> impressed<00:03:18.440> with

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
have to say I was very impressed with

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.880 
have to say I was very impressed with
the<00:03:18.860> performance<00:03:18.980> efficiency<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:21.650> there<00:03:21.800> is

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
the performance efficiency but there is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.320 
the performance efficiency but there is
one<00:03:22.130> thing<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.430> could<00:03:22.580> be<00:03:22.640> an<00:03:22.820> issue<00:03:23.000> for
