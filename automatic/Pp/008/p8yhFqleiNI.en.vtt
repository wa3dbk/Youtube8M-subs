00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.630 

and<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:13.420> she<00:03:13.480> goes<00:03:13.870> through<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> rooftops

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
and so she goes through the rooftops

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.850 
and so she goes through the rooftops
we're<00:03:15.640> gonna<00:03:15.820> follow<00:03:16.060> her<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:20.380> then<00:03:20.530> now<00:03:20.710> it's

we're gonna follow her and then now it's

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.920 
we're gonna follow her and then now it's
fairly<00:03:21.400> simple<00:03:21.700> partly<00:03:22.300> because<00:03:22.450> there's<00:03:22.810> not

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
fairly simple partly because there's not

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.560 
fairly simple partly because there's not
many<00:03:23.230> Templars<00:03:23.770> trying<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.640> kill<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.940> or<00:03:25.300> her
